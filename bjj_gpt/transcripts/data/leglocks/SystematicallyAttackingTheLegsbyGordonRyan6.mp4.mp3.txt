 Alright, now we're going to move into 50-50. And 50-50 isn't really a position that fits into our leg locking philosophy. It's not an asymmetrical position you both have access to with one another's feet. So we don't use it that much. I tend to prefer cross-Ashigarami, inside-Ashigarami, outside-Ashigarami. But you see a lot of people transition back and forth between outside-Ashigarami because they don't have heel hooks, they don't have strong outside heel hooks, so they'll always go in and transfer to a 50-50 situation. For now your partner can attack your feet and they can cross their legs. You'll see me doing the opposite. If we're in 50-50 I'll separate the feet and I'll transfer to outside-Ashigarami because now I feel more confident here. So it's just a matter of what you prefer. I generally prefer asymmetrical leg positions and I like to move to outside-Ashigarami because I know that if I get a bite in outside-Ashigarami I'm going to break your leg. But most people will prefer 50-50 versus outside-Ashigarami because they don't have good mechanics on outside heel hooks. So it's just a matter of what you prefer. There is a place for 50-50. Like I said before, it's a very good position for holding very spastic and explosive guys most of the time. No matter how bad you mess up you can't get crushed, you can't get your guard passed from this position. If your partner's knee is trapped you can't get your back taken. So there are a lot of pluses to it, a lot of positives. But your legs are very exposed. So let's just go into some basic theory now about how I play with 50-50 and what leg configurations I use to keep my feet as safe as possible relative to just having a generic 50-50. There are different leg configurations you can use to make yourself safer. Different foot positions, different knee positions where you do have your partner more exposed to leg locks than you are. So let's run through some basic theory and then get into it. All right, so now let's talk about attacking until you're defending. Be on offense until you're on defense. Whenever we're in a 50-50 scenario and this heel hook's allowed, especially if there's no heel hooks it's different, but when this heel hook's allowed like there usually are in high level competition and no decoupling. You're always on offense until you're on defense. And what does that mean? It means I'm always on offense trying to separate my partner's feet and either go for heel hooks from 50-50, transfer legs, pummel my legs into different positions, or just outright extract my legs. I'm always on offense trying to separate her legs and go into my offense until I'm on defense or my legs are separated. The cue for you to forget what your partner's doing and come forward and deal with their legs and forget what you're doing as far as attacking them and come forward and address what they're doing with pummeling their hands and separating your legs is when your feet become separated. If I'm fiddling around with my partner's feet and her feet are connected and she separates my legs, you are losing this battle from here. Now from here, I have to come forward and address this, reconnect my legs, and then I can go back to separating her legs. If I'm trying to separate her legs from here, I'm going to be losing this battle. Before I separate her legs, she's going to have a heel hook on me and now I'm getting broken. So I'm on offense trying to separate my partner's legs until I feel my legs become separated. The second my legs get uncrossed, I have to sit forward, get to my partner's head and elbow or use whatever grips you're going to use, reconnect my legs, and now I can go back on offense. So this is some basic theory about attacking your partner and trying to separate their legs until your legs are separated. One of the biggest issues, especially beginners have from this position, is they see a heel, your partner's exposed, and now from here, you go for a heel hook and your heel's exposed, maybe your partner has a little bit better mechanics, and you get broken from here. From here, you almost get your partner's legs separated and as your partner's legs are coming apart, your partner already has a heel hook on you and then you see a heel hook there and you're like, oh man, let me go for it, but she's already breaking you and you don't have enough time before you get broken and you end up getting submitted. So the second you feel that your legs come separated, your partner separates your feet, that's your cue to stop what you're doing, unless of course you have a heel hook on your partner and you're in the middle of a break. But if you don't have anything going yet, that's your cue to come forward, figure out a way, and we'll look at these later, how to separate her hands, get her off my feet, recross my ankles, and then go back into your attacks and your partner's legs. All right, so another thing that we can look at, and just a basic idea here, is whenever I can, steal the inside knee position and get my knee down to the floor, this is always good for me. When she's at 50-50, if my knee, of course, is trapped within her knee line, she can break me. If I can invert my knee and I can get my knee down to the floor, now she has much less ability to go in and actually hurt me from this position. So whenever I can invert my knee and get my knee down to the ground, it number one, keeps me relatively safe from my partner's attacks. Number two, it gives me more distance between myself and my partner if I actually have a grip from 50-50, to actually go belly down and make it hard for my partner to get to my hands. The number one issue you have associated with 50-50 is that your partner from here will come forward, get to the hands, separate your hands, pull on your head, and you won't be able to create the extension that you need to actually go into a finish. This knee position, when I'm here, if my knee's off the ground, she has easy access to my head, okay? She can put her body outside my knee. If I invert the knee and I get to this position, now my knees are more or less in front of my partner's body. It's not impossible for her to get to my head. When she goes to get to my head, she can only get to my hand. And now from here, I can go in and start breaking her and it's hard for her to access my head. In order for her to truly access my head and get to a situation where I can't break her, she's got to pull the knee off the floor, she's got to scoot, and now she can get to my head and my hands, and that takes time, okay? So whenever I can invert my knee, it number one, puts me in a relatively safe position with my legs. Number two, if I actually have a grip on the heel, it makes it much harder for my partner to access my hands and my head to actually go into a defensive reaction and not get broken, all right? So whenever I can invert my knee, get the inside knee position down to the floor, you're going to be in a good spot to go in and go in the offense. All right, so now we're going to go to 50-50, and there's two ways my partner can cross their legs, okay? She can cross with a semi-senkaku, which is crossed ankles like so. She can lock with a full figure four like so, okay? Now there's two different ways we separate these, we address these leg positions, okay? If my partner has a semi-senkaku, we go in and we look to catch the sole of my partner's foot like so. We reach through this hole and we catch our partner's heel like so. And now we don't just use the hands versus the legs, we scoot away and we separate like so. And now you have the choice because the feet are open to pass across into an outside ashi garami or to use that cowboy drill where we go in, we catch, and now we start to go in for our breaks, okay? So your partner has two ways to cross, one, semi-senkaku, two, a full figure four. Why would your partner use one versus the other? There are pros and cons to how I'm going to lock my legs, and this goes for me as well, okay? In a semi-senkaku, you have the ability to keep yourself safe from toe holds, okay? And when you have a fully locked triangle, you have better wedging around your partner's leg, okay? People were talking about this in the Nikki Rod match, like, oh man, why did you use a fully locked triangle? You're an idiot, you got a toe hold. Well, when there's grease involved, when there's lotion involved, and your partner's super sweaty or super slippery, and you have a grip like I did here with an Achilles lock, if you have a semi-senkaku, you don't have as much wedging around your partner's leg. It's like if you have a body triangle versus two hooks from the back, the body triangle is always going to be inherently tighter because it's a reinforced wedge with a fully locked triangle. So when you have less wedging with the semi-senkaku, and you let go of the Achilles, and you try to go for a heel hook, your partner, if they're very, very slippery, will be able to pull the leg straight out, okay? And you run into issues like this. So to create extra wedging so that you can relinquish the Achilles grip and actually go for a lock, now you lock a fully locked triangle. So you have better wedging in place. So when your partner goes to pull a leg out, it's much harder for them to actually extract the leg. But the downside is, now she has an access to a toe hold, okay? So it depends on what you're trying to accomplish here, and what the circumstances are in the match. Do you want to be safe from a toe hold, or do you want to have better wedging? Sometimes, depending on who you're going against, you want to have better wedging. Sometimes you want to be safe from a toe hold if you're dealing with an extremely good leg locker. So there's two ways to cross your legs here, and depending on what circumstances you're in, you have to kind of gauge what I want to do from here, all right? So in the first one, she has legs locked. From here, we catch the sole of my partner's foot, we catch the heel of my partner's foot like so. When she goes to lock up tight, if it's her legs versus my hands, she can keep her legs locked from here. But when I physically move away and I scoot my whole body away, when she goes to keep her legs locked, there's no way she can. And now I have the choice of either catching and going in for a heel hook, or I have the choice of passing the leg across and then making my transitions into different ashigaramis and going in for winning attacks there, okay? So you're separating a semi-senkaku quickly and going into either catching the heel or passing it across and changing my leg position. All right, so now let's look at a dilemma game between a toe hold and separating my partner's legs. Understand that if your partner locks in a semi-senkaku, again, there's no threat of a toe hold, but your partner has less wedging if I'm trying to pull my leg out, all right? Understand also that if she has a semi-senkaku, there's all this space for me to take my hand through to grab my partner's second foot. So a lot of times, even if your partner's not trying to put extra wedging in place and not trying to really... not being too concerned with holding your leg, they don't want you separating their legs. So from here, they'll lock a full figure of four. When the full figure of four comes in, it's hard a lot of times to get my hand through to actually grab my partner's second leg. So I'm like, okay, well now what do I do? Whenever I see this, we threaten a toe hold, okay? When we go to threaten a toe hold, of course we grab in like so, and now we come through and we catch the long end of the lever and we go and we lock up. Now if your partner doesn't react to this and she stays with the leg locked in a figure of four, she has no ability to go into a defensive role. When she tries to roll from here, she's figure foured herself in place. You can get catastrophic breaks from here. If your partner either one, unlocks the legs to defend a toe hold, now the legs are unlocked and you just go in and switch and now you can make all of your transitions, or two, she recognizes the toe hold's happening and she switches to a semi-senkaku. She extends her two legs. Now she's playful with the toe hold, but we just go right back in. Now we create a dilemma where if there's not a toe hold danger, she extends the legs out of the toe hold, but now we can grab the heel, we can grab the foot, we can separate the legs and then we can go into all of our attacks. So we play a dilemma game between threatening a toe hold and either finishing it. So if we're here and we're playing around wherever we may be, whether it's in a double seated position, whether I'm out here, it doesn't really make a difference. I can always grab the toes and I can always sit up and get to a toe hold grip. And I stay in a figure four now, I just back heel, I pinch my knees together, I crunch her toes to her butt, I pull her heel to my chin and now when she goes into a defensive roll, she's figure four herself in place and she loses from here. If at any point she separates the legs, if I have control of her other leg, you can still get good breaks from here. But if you want to get your catastrophic breaks, the legs are separated, now we can go back into our heel hook, which is what we wanted all along. Additionally, if I go for a toe hold, she recognizes this and she goes into a semi Senkaku again, that's fine. We just release, we catch and now from here we move back and away and we're ready to go into all of our finishes right from here. And of course, our belly down finishes all remain the same. We're pinching our knees together, we're pulling our heels to her butt and now we're crunching her toes in, we're pulling her heel up and we start to finish up and over our left shoulder. Always looking to get our knee to the floor. And we'll talk more about leg positions and upper body positions later. I'm just playing a dilemma game between attacking the toe hold if we feel like number one, my partner has legs figure four and I can't extract my leg, I want to extract my leg and I can't do it. And number two, her legs are figure four and I feel like I can't create space to get my hand through to actually separate her legs. Just threaten a toe hold. If there's no reaction, she gets broken in the toe hold. If there is a reaction, whether unlocking legs or switching to just cross ankles, then we can always go through, use the previous separation and then win that battle and separate our partner's legs. All right, so kind of piggybacking off of this last clip. If my partner at any point, sorry, my partner at any point separates her legs, if I go for a toe hold in this position and my partner shoots her leg straight and separates her legs to avoid the toe hold, I can go in right away, I can point my knees towards the ceiling and that will immediately expose my partner to a heel hook. So I play a dilemma game where I expose a toe hold if my partner's legs come separated, if she just goes through a semi Senkaku, I separate them myself. If she separates them, I have the choice of either working to whatever position I want to or we can just go right into a heel hook right off the bat. So if we go into this toe hold, she separates the legs because now the toe hold's on, she's like, man, I can't extend my legs into a semi Senkaku. She tries to go to a semi Senkaku, but she can't because the toe hold's too tight. So instead she unlocks her legs and as she unlocks her legs, we just point the knees and we catch. We point the knees, we can go either to the heel or we can go to the knee. Both are good options. Anything that gets us in position, we lock up our hands and then get ready to go into breaks. So we played the dilemma game between the toe hold and if the leg's open, we can either go into separating the legs and passing it across, going into Ashi-Dashi, whatever we want, or we can go right into a heel hook where we point the knees, use the cowboy drill and then break our partner and get the win. All right, so now once we actually lock a heel hook, now we have to look to start countering the hand fight. Understand that if you lock a heel hook from 50-50 and your partner just tries to go into a defensive role in this direction, they're going to get broke. You just splay the legs, you pull the heels to the butt, and now from here you finish with the same mechanics we looked at when we were belly up in the rest of the moves. So you guys can do a full high leg and we're in backside 50-50 and then we just finish belly down and we'll go into that a little bit later. But the second you go against anyone good from 50-50, your inherent problem is always your partner is trying to come forward and get to your hands. So 50-50 is a little bit different than the rest of the Ashi-garamis, but the rest of the Ashi-garamis, you want to keep a bend in your partner's leg. With 50-50, you actually want to get more of an extension of your partner's leg because the closer the heel is to her butt from here, the more access she has to your hands. So what I'm actually trying to do is the second I lock up is I'm trying to extend away from her and go belly down so she can't access my hands. So 50-50 is the opposite of most of the Ashi-garamis in the sense that I'm trying to make more of an extension of the leg rather than a bend in the leg. Now when I go into 50-50 and I get a heel hook, she's always going to be trying to come forward to get outside my knee, get to my head, get to my elbow, pull everything through, and lock up. So the first thing I do, the second I lock up, is I immediately get my knee to the inside position. So the second I separate her legs, I separate, I catch, and as I'm catching, I bring my knee to the inside. Whether it's before I catch, so I can do all of my work from here at first, I can separate the legs and then I can put a heel hook grip in, or more than likely your partner won't let you have that angle, so instead you distract them with the heel hook. They're worried about the heel hook grip, and then from here you scoot and you bring your knee to the inside. Now once I bring my knee to the inside, I don't want my partner threatening me with a toe hold, because remember what we said, the toe hold pressure won't be mechanically as strong as the heel hook, but it'll come on faster. So she'll break me before I get a chance to break her, even though my break will be stronger. So when I invert my knee, I always switch to a semi-senkaku here, so my feet stay safe. Now because my knee's in the inside position, all she can do, unless she scoots the corner from here, all she can do from here is get to my right arm. She tries to access my head in a meaningful way, she can't get to my head. She tries to get to my rear elbow, my left elbow, when she has to, she can't do it. She can only access that near arm. And from here, most of the time, as you're going to move out and away from your partner, she accesses that arm. So this stops you from moving in a lot of situations, like the last 20% of the way. So instead of trying to move against her pulling you and the hand slipped down and everything falls apart, what I like to do is from here, I extend and I give her the arm. So as she has to pull everything towards her, I give her the arm, but I put my body in position. And now that my body's in position, it's just a matter of freeing the hand. Usually she just has some kind of arbitrary grip on it and I just whip it out and then relock. If she has a strong two on one, like so, you saw this in my Cyborg Match at ADCC, it's just a matter of turning the pinky up and down, up and down, up and down. If she has a one on one, I have to turn my hand and I have to slide in the space between the thumb and the middle finger. If I can do that, I can strip the grip. The problem with a two on one is that the opposite hand reinforces the weakness of the first grip. So now I can't just pull straight out, can't go up and down. I have to weaken one grip and then I quickly weaken the other and I weaken the first one and then I go back and forth and I incrementally weaken the connection between each one on one. If I just pull straight out, the two on one will always stop me. So what I do is, if she has a strong two on one, we go in, pinky high, pinky low, pinky high, pinky low. When she goes to hold on tight, we separate. And now at this range, we lock up. Now when she goes to get to my arm again, it's going to be tough. Now the hips come up, we back heel, we pinch the knees, we take her toes in, we pull her heel up and then we finish with a bridge over the bottom shoulder and we get strong finishes. So we count the initial hand fight, we separate our partner's legs and whether before, if your partner's naive, she'll allow you to play with the inside knee. But no one good is going to let you play here. So usually what happens is, as we're separating, we separate our partner's legs, we put the grip in. And now she's like, oh man, I'm going to get broken. So she goes to my arm. Usually what happens is exactly, she has some kind of random arbitrary grip here. Maybe she even locks her hands like this and tries to pull my hands down. If you try to extend against your partner pulling, it ends up a disaster because your chin comes away from your hands, your hands drop low and you lose the position. So I give her the hand. As I give her the hand, it is a random grip, random arbitrary grip on me. Then from here, it's the easiest thing in the world to extend my body, whip the hand out and then just relock. I relock and now I break. If she ends up getting a good grip on me, then it's just a matter of clearing the two on one. I'm here, we go in and we lock, the elbows tight. And most of the time, I just give her the hand. She's trying to pull me towards her. We relock and now we're ready to break. So if your partner's naive, she'll give you the inside knee position. She goes cross legs, we play from here and all of our work is from here. You're winning this battle already. So now it's hard for her to even access my head. A smart player will always stay in this position here. So now we're fighting with both, neither one of us has an angular advantage. I separate the legs and now from here, we lock up immediately, we invert the knee. She goes to get to my hand, we lock up and we're ready to break. Another way that we can start to deny our partner access to our head and to our hands is by going cross waist. One of the best ways to do this is the second I get my inside knee position and my partner goes to come forward, I either one, just fire my leg right over or two, more than likely, I'll have to use some kind of cross shoulder post or shoulder post my partner to manage distance between my chest and her chest. So you can hold your partner with a wristwatch grip like we've been using so far, but your partner has the ability now to take her foot and to push your hand off pretty easily from here. So in general, I use a false grip over my partner's Achilles like so. So that's less purchase and a shorter lever for my partner to push my hand off. Now as she goes to come forward and get to my head, we block my partner in like so. I take my leg free and I just fire it right across and we catch like so. If my partner pulls my head in like so and gets to my head, we have to go through and we have to strip the grip. There'll always be a battle from here. Now I can post my partner's shoulder when she goes to reaccess my head, it's going to be difficult to have to hide my head from here. She takes a low elbow, tries to go underneath, we play here and there's always going to be a grip fighting battle from here. And now you have a choice of going across if there's enough space or if she's leaning forward, I can always lean back and go around. So depending on how close she is to you, sometimes you won't be able to go through. Sometimes you won't even be able to go around. You have to make space. So I back away from my partner, she has a strong grip on my elbow. From here, I clear the head, I clear the collar tight. Now I start moving out and away. She goes to hold my elbow, but the extension of my body versus her grip, I always win. Now as she goes to come forward, again, I can't take my leg through, but instead as she goes to come forward towards me, I high leg over and now I catch. So the further she is forward, the more I'm inclined to hit a high leg and just chop right through my partner's arms and get to that cross waist. The more her shoulders are over her hips, the more inclined I am to just fire right on through and catch my partner's far, get to a cross waist like so. So when I get to the cross waist, it's pretty much game over. Your partner's going to have a real hard time defending. And we'll go into all these defenses with the leg lock when we go into leg lock defenses, but it's going to be real hard for your partner to get out without at least getting popped. We lock up, we separate our partner's legs, however it may be, we come in and we catch. From this position, I can't take my leg across. My partner's too close, so I clear one grip, I extend away. Now she goes to come forward a second time, I cross shoulder post. Maybe I have enough space to throw my leg through and catch. Maybe she's coming so far forward where I can't take my leg through. So we just take a big high leg, we just chop everything down and away. We get to our partner's far hip, and then we use that cross waist position to hit a strong back heel, a strong pinch of the knees. And now from here, once we lock everything up, it just gets so tight right away and we get strong breaks with belly down inverteds with the cross waist position. And once we have the cross waist position, there's no, she has no ability now to start scooting the angle, flanking me and getting to my elbow and my head whatsoever from here. Once my knee is on the floor and we have this cross waist, when she goes to scoot the angle and get to my head, get to my elbow, the leg is a giant wedge between myself and her. She can't scoot the corner, she can't do any of that. This goes again to leg lock defense. What she has to do is lay back, she's getting broken this whole time by the way, she has to lay back, pass the leg across, sit up, scoot the angle, and now she can get to my head and shoulders, which takes three seconds, and that three seconds she's getting catastrophically broken the whole time. So if we can use this cross waist position whenever we can, it's always going to be best. Whether you just extract the leg and fire it right through, or whether you high leg over and chop down through your partner's defensive arms and then get to that cross waist, go into a belly down finish and get strong finishes. And you can also use this if your partner tries to go into a far, into a roll, it serves same purpose as that far head bashi. But now when she goes to hit a strong high leg, she can't do it because there's too much weight over my partner's hip. And now from here we just splay the legs and we break our partner belly up. All right, so this cross waist position is very, very valuable. Very hard to beat defensively. And once you have it, you're almost guaranteed to pop. All right, so there's always going to be the time where my partner starts to build up to a knee from 50-50. Builds up to a knee, builds into a standing position. This is always going to happen. She's not going to chase your back, she's not going to pass your guard from here, unless she frees the knee obviously. But she will start building up to a knee in this position, putting her foot on the floor. So now it's going to be hard for you to expose your partner's heel because there's weight over the foot. All right, so understand that if your partner's shoulders are over her hips and you can bow her knee out in this direction, you can always sit your partner back down to her hips and now you can sit up and start to go into all the moves we just looked at. All right, so in order for your partner to prevent this, she's going to have to turn the knee in in this direction. She's going to have to start leaning over towards me. The second my partner has the shoulders far in front of the hips, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start going into an inversion into backside 50-50. This is the dilemma. If my partner's shoulders are over her hips and I can open the knee, you can easily sit your partner down. If the shoulders are far in front of the hips and I have a hard time opening the knee because of her waist leaning so far forward, we just take our hand, the back of our hand, and we just catch inside our partner's far leg like so. We switch to a cross lat grip like so. And now from here, we just pull our knees into our chest and we start to invert. Once we make a transition underneath our partner, our left hand can switch from a cross lat to a frame on our partner's leg. And now from here, we just start to rotate and we use the extension of our hips to push our partner out and now we end up in backside 50-50. Or now from here, we can make various transitions into other different kinds of ashi garamis and 50-50s and go into breaks on our partner. So we play a basic dilemma game where our partner comes up either to a knee or in standing position where if the shoulders are over the hips, we knock them backwards. If the shoulders are in front of the hips, we go underneath. So she builds up to a knee, I play a game where I push, pull, push, pull, push, pull until eventually I can either knock her backwards or I can get to that far leg. And now from here, we can go in and we can get nice strong breaks on our partner from a backside 50-50. So from this side, I push, I pull, I push, I pull until I'm ready to go. And as I pull, we go in here, we invert, we switch and we just pass everything on by. We fall into backside 50-50 and now from here, mechanics, belly down, are once again the same. We lock everything up, we start doing belly down, strong back heel, knees pinching, toes to butt, heel to chin and then I bridge and I look over my left shoulder and we get strong finishes for a belly down break from backside 50-50. We play a basic dilemma game between shoulders and hips. The shoulders are over the hips, we knock them backwards. The shoulders are in front of the hips, we invert underneath them. So once we get into backside 50-50, there's a lot of different transitions we can hit from this given leg position. And we can feed regular 50-50 into different variations here. Where if I invert my knee before I get a heel up, we can go into cross waist, we can go into crisscross. So there's many different ways we can palm our legs from here from 50-50. We can extract our leg from here, we can go cross hoshi, we can do a bunch of different things from here. We can feed from ashi garami to ashi garami, depending on where you're comfortable and what you want to do. The same is true for an inverted position when we're in backside 50-50. Now backside 50-50 and double 50, in my opinion, are actually the strongest leg locking positions. Now I still think cross hoshi is the best leg locking position because you can hold your partner there for minutes at a time. Backside 50-50 and double 50 are more like intermediary positions. You can't force someone to stay there. They can always high leg over, strip grips, palm a legs, and they can end up back in a 50-50 where you're both facing belly up. But it is the best leg locking position, the strongest leg locking position, where you have very, very good attacks. You can get strong breaks in your partner's legs. But I still put cross hoshi above it because of the fact that you can hold people there for long amounts of time, and you can't do that in backside 50-50. But it's very easy to expose your partner's heel. It's almost impossible for them to hide the heel. You can almost always get some kind of break in your partner, but your partner can always move and create motion towards an escape. So let's look at this now. So we go 50-50. She can hook to her knee, for example. We go into an inversion, and we end up in backside 50-50 like so. Once we're in backside 50-50, there are many different ways that we can work from here. Right now, this is just backside 50-50. So if our partner stays in this position, she gets broken belly down. Now, if our partner stays on a knee, it's going to be hard for us to transition to double 50. But she can't stay on her knee. She either has to step her leg up and start pushing back into me to alleviate some of the pressure, and then that allows us to go to double 50. Or she has to start high-legging over to try to go back belly up and then get to our head and elbow and clear the grip. So let's first deal with the high leg. So from here, we go backside 50-50. What I don't want is my legs unlocked. We're now from here, she can go in for heel hooks on knee as well, and we're kind of in a shootout. I want to keep my legs locked in this position, and I want to have a strong back heel in like so, in case I can start breaking my partner from here. When she goes to start backstepping, I want to get my knee inverted. What I don't want is her to backstep, and we end up here, and now she has access to my head and my elbow. The second she goes to backstep through, I want to have my knee inverted. I don't want her coming forward. So when she goes to backstep, I unlock my feet and I just take my foot right in the middle of my partner's body like so, and I place my right knee on the floor. When she goes to come forward towards me, I have an initial wedge between myself and my partner. Now you have the choice of going to 50-50, or in my personal opinion, my favorite option, going cross waist like so. Now once we're cross waist, we go in, we go belly down, my partner can't access my hand, then we break her. From here, we go backside 50-50. From here, she goes to high leg through. As she goes to high leg through, we catch, we go cross waist, and we immediately invert that knee and we go to a belly down breaking position where we can get strong breaks right from the get go. Okay? Then we go in here, she goes to high leg through, to backside 50. We end up in this position. However we feed ourselves into this leg entanglement, this is how we finish. From here, she goes to start coming out and over. The second I see this, she goes to high leg, my feet unlock, she goes to come forward towards me, she can't do it. Leg comes through, and now we're in perfect breaking position, ready to finish right from a cross waist position off of the initial backside 50-50. This is if she high legs. Now coming back, another great option she has from here, is from this position, she can step her leg up and try to push back into me through leaving some of the pressure. This is a pretty smart move on her part. Whenever I see this, we just go in and we capture our partner's far leg. Now if your legs are short and your partner's leg, and your partner's very long, it's hard to collapse your partner's leg from here. So what I generally like to do is I initially catch my partner's far hip like so. So if she ever tries to run away from me, she can't do it because I'm locked into the far hip. Now from here, if I have a heel hook grip and I feel like I can't break, I let it go. From here, I just go in and I access my partner's far leg. You can always access your partner's far leg just by taking your head and moving it towards your partner's far leg like so. And now we just take a foot, we place it behind our partner's knee. When she gets to keep her leg straightened, I pull with my left hand and I push with my left foot. This always puts a slight bend in my partner's leg. And now from here, we can shoot our way in and we can pull our partner's leg towards us and we can cover our partner's leg into a double 50 position. Double 50 position is probably the best inverted breaking position we can be in from here. Can't stay here forever, but you have two to three seconds or more depending on how smart your partner is. They get incredibly strong breaks where we go in, we go belly down, and now my partner goes to run away. No way. When she has to palm all her legs, no way. When she goes to back step right from here, there's no way unless she strips my grip. And as she's stripping the grip, she's getting broken. So double 50 off of the initial backside 50 transition is one of the best situations you can find yourself in. The only thing your partner can do from here is to start to post on your ankle to push the ankle out. And now as she goes to back step through, she can high leg. And now as she goes to high leg, we can switch either one, that cross waist position, or two as she has to strip. Instead of going cross waist, we just take our foot in like so. And now as she goes to high leg over, we follow into crisscross ashi, bottom side, and we end up breaking our partner belly down like so. So we can either go crisscross ashi or we can go far waist, 50-50. And both of these are amazing breaking positions where my partner has no ability to come forward, get to my hands, get to my head, and get strong breaks for the win. So this time, we start in backside 50. If my partner's knee stays on the floor, I can't take my leg out and go to double 50. But I don't have to. I just break my partner belly down. I start turning, I break my partner. If she has a quick high leg, then I just follow her through and I invert the knee and I go cross waist 50-50. And if she steps her leg up and starts to get into an athletic stance, we just catch our partner's far hip like so. If go back. If she steps her leg up and it's close to me, just like this, I can always take my leg out and collapse my partner's leg. But if she steps it far up and away, I catch my partner's far hip. When she has to run out and away from me, because the far hip's controlled, she can't move. And now from here, we just take our head, we catch. Her head moves in like so. If we feel, we absolutely cannot get to my partner's leg. What I want is to get to my partner's leg and go in and start to put a bend in my partner's leg. That's like I absolutely can't get a bend in my partner's leg or I can't reach my partner's leg. We just push on my partner's kneecap like so. When she goes to straighten it and push back into me, just a push will take her weight off and that will allow me to turn belly down. And now from here, even if I don't have the leg trapped, there's more than enough breaking pressure. In the event that maybe you are so short or your partner's so long and so much bigger than you, there's so much size discrepancy, you can't grab the ankle, you don't have to. She steps her leg forward, I just push on the back of the kneecap. She goes to push into me, her whole thing is to extend the leg and to push towards me. But her push towards me with her hands is never going to be nearly as strong as the extension with my legs. And once my right knee points down, there's no return. If you can get to the leg, you can get to the ankle, I put a bend in the ankle or I put a bend in the knee and now from here we come over, we just trap our partner's knee down. And now we go in, we tuck the elbow, we lock up, we have an incredibly strong belly down inverted from here. Now your partner has the only recourse from here is to take pops. As she goes to start stripping this grip, she goes to high leg, we can either one, block her from coming forward, go cross waist, two, she goes to move in, we go in here and we go to crisscross. She goes to high leg over, she ends up in crisscross, we go belly down and now we're ready to break our partner with an inverted heel hook. So many, many good options from a backside 50 position depending on if your partner stays on a knee or steps a leg up. And does she stay belly down or does she high leg over and go back into a belly up position where now she's trying to pummel her legs and defend, but it's too late because you either immediately move into cross waist or into crisscross ashi. All right, so now finally, many times in 50-50, people won't stay in the pocket or they won't try to come forward and try to get to your head, get to your elbow right away. The second you separate their legs, they'll just go right into a defensive role. If they go into a role in the wrong direction, they just expose their own heel. So their legs are separated and she goes into a role in this direction, she just gets broke. This is idiotic. She goes into a role in the correct direction. Now from here, as she goes to role in this direction, you have a much better control over your partner and a much better ability to stop them or slow them down from rolling from 50-50 than you do with cross ashi. So when she goes to start rolling, I just point my knees in the opposite direction of her role and my hips come forward. So she carries my weight the whole time. So the role now is very labored. My whole thing from here is to block my partner's toes so that as she goes to start rolling, we grab the knee, we labor, we put weight on my partner so the role is labored. And as she goes to roll, we follow, follow, follow. And as always, we just touch our own rib cage, we come across and now immediately we scoot to invert that knee. The good news is if you miss, there's no misdirectional escape from here. There's no back exposure. Felipe, for some reason, didn't realize the difference between cross ashi Garami and 50-50. He tried to do the misdirectional against Tex Johnson and just turned right back into the heel hook and got his leg broken. So don't try to do a misdirectional from 50-50. It won't work. It'll just turn right back into the heel hook. So even if you miss the heel hook, you don't have to switch to an Achilles because there's no misdirectional escape from here. So even if I miss, if she tries to hit a misdirectional from here, she just goes right back into 50-50. And if my hand's in position and she goes to misdirect, she turns right back into a heel hook, which is what happened to Felipe. You can't do it from here. So you don't have to switch to an Achilles if your partner gets the shoelaces facing towards the floor. You just follow through and restart. But from here, what I want is as she goes to roll through, let's say I separate the legs and instead of coming forward towards me, she just says, I'm going to bail. Let me get out of here. So she goes to roll through. As she goes to roll through, we follow, follow, follow. We catch. And immediately, if I can, I go cross ways. I can't always do that. At the bare minimum, I want to create extension with the leg. I want to go in and I want to start to go into my breaks from 50-50. So following a roll through, wedging my partner in place, and understanding the difference between 50-50 and cross Ashi. There's no misdirectional escape. So there's no real need for you to switch to an Achilles unless you're Ashi Gromny, the 50-50 is so loose, you feel your partner can pull right out and away. But you don't need an Achilles strip to stop you from getting your back taken from here. So just following from 50-50, you can also make transitions to other leg positions from here. So as your partner goes to roll through from here, at any point, I feel like I don't want to stay in 50-50 because her legs are open as we land, I can transfer to outside Ashi. So now we can go and we can start attacking from there. So because the legs are open and because so much is happening, you can move from 50-50 into other leg transitions as you roll through. You don't have to stay with 50-50. So understanding the differences between following a leg from 50-50 versus across Ashi, for example. There's some very similar mechanics and some very big differences as far as whether or not your back's exposed, transferring legs across, things like that. So just keep this in mind as you're attacking from 50-50 and you have someone who doesn't come forward to get to your head and your elbow, they just bail out and try to roll explosively out until they eventually free the leg. Future Ashi is essentially the 50-50 of outside heel hooks, where she has a grip on me and potential to lock an outside heel hook and I have potential to lock an outside heel hook on her. And this isn't really a position you want to find yourself in because of the fact that you can't really hide your legs, like there's no crossing your legs from this position. You don't really want to find yourself in this position, you'd rather be in an outside Ashi, you'd rather be in a far hip Ashi, which we can look at later. You don't really want to be here where your leg's exposed to toe holds, to heel hooks, and there's just nothing you can do from here to actually connect your legs and hide your feet. But nonetheless, this position usually arises when a person is caught behind on a leg pommel. So let's say I have a Rimi Ashi grab me, for example, and my partner pommels inside my legs, from here she pulls the leg through, and now we end up in a Michiwa Ashi. This is usually something that no one really chooses to go here, to end up in this position, but you kind of just end up here when your partner beats you on a pommel or you leave your leg behind and you get caught with your leg exposed. From a half guard, for example, if I have a butterfly half guard and I elevate my partner up, we end up in a Rimi Ashi grab me like so, where now even if she sits back into my legs, she has no ability to attack my legs. So let's say I have a knee shield half guard, and from here I elevate my partner up, because my foot started on the outside position, I throw my legs into position, and now if she sits back, we end up in a Michiwa Ashi grab me. So these are some kind of ways we can end up here. It's not really a situation where we would force ourselves into because we wanted to play from there. It's more of a position that we end up in because we leave our legs behind or we get beat on a pommel. Tell the joke. You shoot me first, you last. Great joke. What's the punchline? I'm here for two days. Okay. I'm done with this. And I'm not going to do it again. I'm here for two days, okay, I'm done with this, enough is enough. Are you ready? I'm not ready. Okay, almost ended the day through. Okay, so now let's talk about discussing going last. What does this mean? It means the person in general who looks to expose the heel first will usually end up getting heel hooked. Alright, and this is the reason why. If we both have heel hooks or potential heel hooks from this Michiwashi position and she tries to fall to her side to expose my heel. As she goes to fall to expose my heel, we're both obviously trying to keep our heels connected to our partner's hips in order to not get heel hooked, right? And the further she can get, the closer she can get to having the outside blade of her foot on the floor, and this is more about lip lock defense, and we'll go into this in a separate instructional again. But the closer she can get to having the outside blade of her foot to the floor, the less heel exposure I have, okay? So if we're, we start in this position, we're both laying back like so, and I say one, two, three, go. And she sits up, I sit up, and she goes to expose my heel. As she goes to expose my heel, and she goes to go belly down and start exposing my heel, she exposes her own heel. And now from here, I can go in and I can start breaking her, she has no grip on my leg, and I usually get to the wind first, provided I have, you know, equal or we have equal breaking mechanics, I can actually break her leg from here, okay? So the person who usually goes first usually ends up losing. We say whistle blows, whatever the case is, we're in a transition, equal leg positions. She goes to expose, she goes belly down, what she's looking to do from here, stop, what she's looking to do from here, she's looking to go belly down, expose my heel, and now from here, transfer to Asadashi, or go to the far hip, and then start to go in and break me, okay? But the problem is, when she goes belly down, she goes to start turning and exposing my hip, even if she doesn't go completely belly down, when she goes to start exposing me, she exposes herself. And now from here, I can roll her through and I can break her. So in general, you don't want to be the person who goes first. You want to be the person who's able to expose your partner's heel. And if you try to expose their heel, and you start to go belly down and fall to your hip, you just inherently expose your own heel. So you have to be careful here how you go about your offense, making sure that your feet are protected while you're attacking your partner's feet. If she goes first and she goes to expose my heel, and she exposes her own heel, then I just catch the heel, okay? But let's say that we both know that the person who goes first is going to lose this battle, okay? From here, she sits up. From here, what I'm going to look to do, instead of going belly up or going belly down and trying to expose my partner's heel, is I'm going to try to force my partner into a situation where she is more or less on the correct hip for me to expose her heel, okay? The way that I do this is by taking my nice false grip we always use here, pulling my partner's knee across to my right hip, and then just using my left knee to bump my partner's body out and over to the side. As I do so, I want to raise my partner's heel and foot off the ground. If her foot's on the floor, I can't expose it. So the combination of the pull, the bump, and a slight lift of my hips gets my partner's heel up and off the floor. Now all that's left to do is for me to sit up, if I'm not already doing it, and then use that cowboy drill, okay? Usually I'll be in a situation like so, where I have good control of my partner's leg, but if at any point she tries to extract the leg, she can't do it. She can't move away from me from here. So I'll go in false grip, false grip on the ankle, and we're in like so. Now she's trying to push me to my left hip or get me to fall to my left hip so she can expose me. So my whole thing from here is to pull her knee across, to bump her knee across, to lever her knee across with my left knee, like so. So when she goes to force me to my left hip, it's going to be hard from here. Now that her leg's off the floor, I just raise my hips slightly. As I raise my hips, that cowboy drill comes into effect. And now from here we catch. The second we catch, we go in and we lock up. Now we start putting breaking pressure on. So I at least take my foot to my partner's hip like so. And now we start going in, we start putting that breaking pressure on. When she goes to start rolling from this position, we're going to follow by just reaping our left leg across. And now we start putting breaking pressure on. She has to roll through. As she rolls through, we know what to do. We transfer to outside ashi garami, we lock up our hands, and now we can go into our break from an outside ashi. We have the hands locked, we have the legs locked, and we move from a mutual ashi into an outside ashi. Okay, we start up. We're in position. We're in a shootout here. This is no good. From this position, we grab a false grip. From here, we pull our partner's knee across. We bump our partner's knee across with our left knee. And now from here, we just raise the hips and we go into that cowboy drill. We lock up. From here, we lock up, we go into a post center part of this hip, and now we start reaping across. We get strong defensive reaction where she goes to roll through. As she does so, we transition to outside ashi, and now we're ready to go in and get strong breaks with our partner. That's rolling through with our legs unlocked. We can also use the same method we looked at before by getting a quicker reaction from our partner with a toe hold, whether it be with a one-handed, a single-handed toe hold. We start putting pressure on our partner here, and now as she goes to roll, we transition to a heel hook. We can open the hands and just grab the heel, grab the toes. That gets enough pressure to get my partner rolling, and then we feed to a heel hook and we reap. Or as my partner goes belly down, trying to expose my heel, we go for a full toe hold. The toe hold will get breaking pressure sooner. Because you're in a shootout, using a toe hold to expose my partner's heel and then start getting a quicker defensive reaction is often a good choice from here. She goes to start rolling. We make the transition. We're in outside ashi, and then we go into break. Rolling through, following my partner with unlocked legs, using either a heel hook at first or using a toe hold to get a quicker defensive reaction, and then transitioning to a more mechanically efficient outside heel hook, rolling through, and then finishing from there. All right, so now, when we're in this mutu ashi, we want to be able to hide our feet the best we can. The problem is there's no real way to lock your legs because your legs are completely split apart. One way we actually can lock our legs, whether it be before, or whether it be after we get our partner's heel, is instead of just bringing our foot to our partner's hip, if we can at any point take our foot through and get to a far hip ashi, now our feet are safe. We can attack our partner's legs, and she can attack mine. What I don't want is to lock a full figure four here. Because again, if she goes in and she locks a toe hold, now from here, I can't roll defensively because of the fact that my legs are figure four. I actually wedge myself in place. From here, I can go and I can lock a far hip ashi. We looked at a far hip ashi from other scenarios. When we're in cross ashi, we move to a far hip ashi. We've looked at these similar positions before, but now we have an outside heel hook position. Now if she has to attack my legs from here, she can. The only thing she can do is lean back and transfer my legs over or roll through. Because I have a far hip position, if she tries to heel slip from here, she can't bring her far hip off the floor. If she tries to come towards me and push me in this direction, the far hip position stops her. If she tries to come forward and fight my hands, I have two legs in front of her. She can't get to my hands. She gets broken. She has only two options. She, number one, can transfer my legs to the outside, but she's getting broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken. Ashi sits up and she's still getting broken. Okay, so you're going to get strong breaks here. Or number two is your partner goes to roll through. As your partner goes to roll through from here, we just follow the roll as we always do. She goes to roll through. We transfer to outside ashi and we break as we always do. Now we can do this before we expose the heel or we can do it after. So we're in mutuashi. We expose the heel. She goes to start rolling through and as she goes to roll through, we just sneak our legs back into position. So now our legs are locked. So if at any point my heel slips, for example, and she moves back in the same direction she came, my feet are safe. If my feet are unlocked when I'm going to do this roll and now the heel slips, she comes back. Now she can expose my heel. So it's always in your best interest to cross the ankles if we can and get to this far hip position. Now even if I lose the heel and she comes back, she still can't expose my legs. And now from here, as I go to put heat on, she goes to roll through. As she goes to roll through, we end up in a good breaking position on the opposite side with outside ashi and we're ready to go. So any time that we're in a mutual ashi and we can transfer it to a far hip ashi, this is always in our best interest because now she only has two choices. She can either roll, in which case we end up in outside ashi and she's getting broken the whole time, or she has to lean back, pass my legs across. She's getting broken this whole time. She sits up and she's still getting broken. She's still getting broken and now she gets fully broken with the outside ashi. Because either way, you end up in an outside ashi grommy and you're ready to go in and break your partner for the win. All right, so everyone always talks about gripping. And the reason why I didn't teach gripping until the end of this instructional is simple. Your ashi grommy is like an engine to a car. And your gripping is like a transmission to a car. If you have a three speed, you can get around town, no problem. It's not going to be as efficient as an eight speed, not going to be as efficient as a 10 speed, but you can operate your car and you can get around town. What car has 10 speed? 10 speed automatic transmission? Plenty of cars. One, two, three, four, five, six, automatic. 10 speed automatic. Ford Raptor, R, 10 speed auto. Many of them. Never in my whole life. Okay. So if you use only one grip, you can operate. You can still get strong heel hooks. But if you have a poor ashi grommy, if you don't have control that you need and the wedging that you need with your ashi grommy, if you don't have an engine to your car, nothing works. So the way that you master leg locks is by first having a truly strong and efficient ashi grommy to be able to control people for long amounts of time when they're resisting and talented and follow them from ashi grommy to ashi grommy. Once you get the control down, you can finish people. That's what jiu jitsu is. It's control that leads to submission. You can't control the person through the ashi grommy. Nothing else matters. And so with the gripping, you can get false positives. You can get positive results by using stronger grips, but having a weak and lacking ashi grommy. Okay. And this works up to a certain point, but then you start going against good guys. And because the ashi grommy is maybe using a reverse figure four grip, for example, which is the strongest grip, but you have a very loose ashi grommy, but the grip itself is so strong that you're getting taps. You're getting positive results, even though everything's not perfect. Okay. So the way that you should build into these leg locks is by first building a rock solid ashi grommy. Once you have a rock solid ashi grommy, you can control and control resisting opponents for long amounts of time and move from ashi grommy to ashi grommy. Then you start transitioning from palm to palm grips to different grips. Okay. But the gripping comes last. You should be able to finish the best guys in the world with one hand, with a 10 finger grip, with the weakest grips possible. That's how you know your breaking mechanics and your ashi grommy is sufficient. Okay. Once you have a sufficient ashi grommy, you have good breaking mechanics, then you start transitioning to the other grips. This is why I waited until the last minute. Okay. So let's take a look at these grips here. Understand when I make grips with my hands and I connect my hands, it forms a circle like so. A 10 finger grip is the smallest circle, a palm to palm grip is smaller, a wrist to wrist grip is smaller, and a figure four grip is the smallest. The smaller the circle, the intrinsically tighter the lock will be. Okay. So the tighter my lock, the smaller my circle gets, the tighter my lock will be. Okay. So if you want to practice breaking mechanics, if you can break someone without even locking your hands and put them on breaking point, you know your breaking mechanics are good. Okay. If you're dealing with someone talented and you can lock up a 10 finger grip and you can put someone on breaking point, you know your mechanics are good. Okay. So if you're ever trying, if you ever want to test yourself, you're going with someone good, you want to say, Hey, I want to test my mechanics. Don't even use a palm to palm grip. Use a 10 finger grip. That's the weakest grip of them all. And now from here, if you can break someone, you know you're good. Now you can progress to a palm to palm grip. You can progress to a wrist to wrist grip like so, and then you can progress. I usually don't go to a figure four grip because from here you have slippage problems. Here wrist to wrist, you don't really have run into slippage problems. With figure four grips, because the orientation of your hand changes because you rotate your hand, you end up with slippage problems here. So instead of going figure four, I go reverse figure four where I grab my own bicep and I take the opposite hand up nice and high. And this is a very strong grip here. So we use wristwatch grip like so, a false grip sometimes to control our partner. So your partner can't kick the hands off like we talked about from a 50-50. So we use a false grip for control, a wristwatch grip to initially catch and control and practice breaking mechanics if we want to, a 10-finger grip, a palm to palm grip, a wrist to wrist grip, and a reverse figure four grip. Okay? Now there'll be times where one grip is more, makes more sense to use than the other. Let's say for example, I'm thinking for my partner's heel here, and I feel like from here I can't lock a wrist to wrist grip. I can't lock a palm to palm grip from here. You feel like it's, your hand's just getting wedged into the floor, you can't do it. So what I do, I lock a 10-finger grip, so at least my hands are connected from here. I can't connect my hands in any other fashion. So I connect my hands in a 10-finger grip, and now from here I use a 10-finger grip and a back heel to pull myself off my shoulder, she's trying to heel slip and come towards me, I pull myself up. Now I shoot palm to palm. Now I shoot wrist to wrist. And that is what allows you to change from one grip to the other, and you use different grips in different scenarios. So if my partner's trying to heel slip in towards me from various different positions, and I feel like I have a grip, but I just can't lock my hands, the floor's getting in the way, I can't go palm to palm, I can't really lock the way I want to, you lock 10-finger. We pull ourselves up, and then we shoot wrist to wrist. We shoot to a palm to palm grip. And then we can make this circle tighter. You can't always lock at the tightest circle right away, sometimes you have to work your way up. You have to climb up to a tighter circle. I go from 10-finger, then I lock palm to palm. Maybe I can't go wrist to wrist yet, maybe I pull it up, maybe I go here, I pull it up, I go palm to palm, and I pull it up and I go wrist to wrist. We can change our grip through the transition. In general, whenever I can, I go to the tightest grip possible. With wrist to wrist, wrist to wrist is the tightest grip you can make without actually changing your hand position. So if I go wrist to wrist, this is super tight, in order to change to a reverse figure four, you run into slippage problems sometimes because you have to release the tension to switch to a reverse figure four. So in general, when I'm going in and I'm going belly down, I'm going for belly down finishes, if I have to, I'll use a 10-finger grip to switch to a palm to palm, or a wrist to wrist is usually preferable. Wrist to wrist is the tightest here. Now I don't, not to say you can't do this, you can, and if it works, it pays off, but in general, I stay with the wrist to wrist. I don't switch to a reverse figure four because now, from here, you run into slippage problems on the transition and you lose your partner. I generally use figure fours when I'm not belly down, but when I'm belly up. My partner goes to rotate through and I'm in a belly up position because now, even if you get slippage problems, your partner can't put weight on top of you and you don't run the risk of losing the heel. So I'll start here, she goes to maybe into a defensive roll, then I switch to reverse figure four, and now I break with the reverse figure four. And now from here, if she rolls through a second time, I'm just going to release, I don't break you. She rolls through a second time, excuse me, and we end up in this belly down position because I already had the figure four locked, now I just finished with the reverse figure four and it's very tight when we go belly down again. So in general, I use 10 finger, palm to palm, and wrist to wrist grips when I'm finishing belly down. When I'm finishing belly up, for whatever reason, maybe I'm here, maybe I'm trying to break my partner and it's cracking, it's popping, she's not rolling through, this is the perfect time now because we're belly up to switch to that reverse figure four. Now you can get catastrophic breaks. And now if she rolls through, you end up in Atarashi, you have that same reverse figure four, and now you're belly down, you're belly down now, and now you have the same reverse figure four that you had, which is just twice as strong when you're belly down, and you get catastrophic breaks from here. It can actually remain the same belly down, whether I have a reverse figure four or palm to palm, wrist to wrist. It's always back heel, pinching the knees, heel to chin, toes to butt, and bridging. So in general, when I'm facing belly down, I use whatever grip. I always prefer wrist to wrist, but you can't always get wrist to wrist. Sometimes I use a palm to palm to pull myself or a 10 finger to pull myself up into a palm to palm, and then I shoot wrist to wrist, or I go from 10 finger right to wrist to wrist, or sometimes even right to palm to palm, and then I finish from there. When I'm belly up and she's belly down inverted, there's not a lot of chance of slippage and losing the heel. So I tend to switch then to reverse figure four grips. Whereas when I'm belly down, if I try to switch to a reverse figure four grip, a lot of times as you're making the transition, your partner's coming towards you, putting weight on you, you get slippage problems, and you lose the heel altogether. You don't really run to that problem when you're facing belly up. In addition, one more thing, when she's more facing belly up and I'm trying to finish, we talked about before, the mechanics more facing belly up were different than the mechanics when we were facing belly down. When I'm facing belly up and I have a 10 finger, a palm to palm, or a wrist to wrist grip, it's not wrong to crunch your partner's toes to the butt and to pull the heel to the chin and to get finishes. You can do that, but the chance of slippage runs high. So in general, when I'm looking to break belly up, whether it's with inside or outside heel hooks, the mechanics are different. Instead of putting a bend in the leg, I straighten the leg and I open my body in the opposite direction and that gives you strong finishes. This changes if you switch to a reverse figure four grip. If I switch to a reverse figure four grip, now there's no issue of slippage. If you try to open up your left elbow in the same fashion, you actually relieve the pressure. If you switch to a reverse figure four grip, now the whole thing is the same mechanics as you would have if you're facing belly down. I had a strong back heel. I opened my knees, so actually the opening of the knees is different. Normally, more belly down, we pinch the knees together. We still splay the knees and we back heel, but the upper body mechanics are the same. I crunch the toes down. I pulled the heel to my chin and instead of opening my partner's leg by taking my left elbow up like so, I crunch my partner's toes down to her butt and I pull my heel to her chin by taking my left elbow instead of up in this direction, I take my elbow down towards my hip and that gives me strong finishes. The mechanics are different with your belly up when you switch to a reverse figure four. This is super, super important. Same for inverted heel hooks. She takes her hands, take your hips up high. When we're in this position here, normally I would be splaying the knees, back heeling, and then opening in this direction. When I have a reverse figure four, there's no slippage problem. Instead of opening, I crunch the toes to the butt, I pull the heel to the chin, and I move in the opposite direction. Instead of opening my left elbow, I close the left elbow and that gives me strong finishes. The gripping mechanics with a reverse figure four when you're belly up are a little bit different. Everything's a little bit different now. Everyone's always asking about what kind of gripping you use. The tighter the circle, the smaller the circle, the tighter the lock is going to be, but you can't always use the tightest lock. You can't always use reverse figure fours. There are certain times for each grip and you have to be able to use them all the time. It's just like you can't start out in sixth gear. You can't only use first gear to drive on the highway. You have to be able to transition through all gears and depending on what you're trying to do, what your goals are, what you're trying to accomplish, how fast you're trying to go, you have to be able to pick which gear you're using in certain given scenarios to be the most efficient and to get the most effective results you're trying to get. That's my explanation on gripping and it's super, super important. What are you getting about now? Nothing? That clip wasn't, it wasn't where I complained the clip was too long or anything? I thought it was good. Okay, me too. All right. So, you went to this leg lock instructional. It's probably about two years or three years overdue. I never put out a leg lock instructional before. John did them, a bunch of other guys did them, but this is my first one. I know there's a lot of theory and concepts that John talked about when he first came out with his. I didn't watch his, but I know that there's a lot about concepts and leg locks were very new back then still. So I put a lot of concepts in there too, but I didn't want to get too conceptual with you guys because I know that his leg lock instructional is probably one of the most watched ones ever. So I didn't want to be redundant. So I just put a lot of just like the decision tree stuff in there. If my partner does this, I do that. And then just moving through transitions and then transferring from Ashigarami to Ashigarami and logical and coherent sequences until we got through the whole thing. And then I added some new stuff that we've been working on with the backside 50-50, the double 50 and stuff like that. And then going through all the gripping stuff, which I'm not sure whether or not John put that in the first instructional, but I wanted to put some of that new gripping stuff and the new 50-50 stuff we've been working on. And then just some of the new ideas we've had over the last couple of years. There's been some relatively big developments in the leg locking world, in our team specifically. So I just wanted to give you guys just a coherent format from start to finish, going through all the Ashigaramis and then going into most importantly, the breaking mechanics. So you can control guys, you can move from Ashigarami to Ashigarami in a fluid way, and then you can break your partner once you actually get a grip of the control of your partner's heel. So next will be probably leg lock defense. I didn't go into too much of leg lock defense. I just talked about some basic leg pommeling and keeping your feet in aspectical positions to keep yourself safe. But we'll go into a full leg lock defense, from early defenses, pommeling to late defenses when we're in fully locked heel hooks later on. And that'll be a whole separate instructional. So hopefully you guys enjoyed it. I think it's like seven, seven and a half hours plus the rolling footage. So hopefully that was a good amount of information for me, guys. Thank you to Finax. Thank you to Sonny. Thank you to Sonny for sitting here and yapping the whole time we were doing this, this entire three days. And now we're going to go try to eat something. So see you guys.
