 Alright, so now we're going to look at a hantaisen kaku. A hantaisen kaku usually comes out of a situation where you have a front, not always, but usually comes out of a situation where you have a front triangle and your opponent defends the front triangle by either tucking their hand behind them or locking their hands up so you can't pass the hand across the body. So the basic dilemma is, if you can get their elbow across the center line, you go for a mote senkaku, the front triangle. If you can't get their hand across the center line and they either glue it to the hip very strong or they lock their hands behind the back very strong and you can't get the elbow across the center line, you make a transition to hantaisen kaku. So there's two uses of hantaisen kaku, and you have to be aware of both of them. This is why you have to master offense before you can master defense, so you know what's going on and what possible attacks your partner can throw at you. If your partner chooses to switch to a hantaisen kaku off of an initial mote senkaku, and I can't take the hand and elbow across the center line, she locks her hands up like so, and they choose to switch to a hantaisen kaku where the shin is parallel and runs along the line of the shoulder blades, this is the time where they're going to use hantaisen kaku to go into kimura, where I can expose my partner's wrist, and I can go in and I can start locking kimura, and we can go in and we can finish with kimura. If my partner locks the hands, for example, I can't go for a front triangle. If my partner starts inverting the knee into a situation where my left knee inverts, I start inverting my body underneath my partner, and now from here the shin is perpendicular to the shoulder line and the run straight up and down from ceiling to floor. Now you find yourself in strangle danger. So there are two main functions with this hantaisen kaku. One is by just changing the configuration of the legs from here and then exposing kimura. You'll see this when you can clearly see the knee and the shin runs along the line of the shoulder blades. And you'll see a hantaisen kaku where the strangulation danger, where the knee starts to invert, the person on balance starts to move into an inverted position more or less, and now from here we can go in and start locking up hantaisen kaku where there's strangulation danger now, but less kimura danger. We have to understand the dilemma game and the combinations your partner can throw at us depending on how they lock their triangle. They can either use it for kimura or they can use it for a strangle. And we have to be able to defend both the kimura and the strangle at the same time. So understand that this triangle kimura dilemma, the trimura, is one of the most robust, controlling, and devastating locks in the sport. You're in a kimura and your head is also trapped. It's just brutal. The first thing we're looking at is making sure that our partner does not lock a kimura. That's the number one thing. So when she switches her leg configuration, like so, and she goes to lock kimura, I have to do everything I can to start taking my second hand and stripping wrists, peeling wrists off. And when she goes to start reaching and exposing my elbow, I always look to come in and I look to feed her wrist to my hand. So when she goes to lock kimura, I can always peel one hand. I can't access this hand much, but I can always access the hand that exposes my wrist. So when she tries to lock kimura from here, I just punch it in. Now she wants it going in towards my hip as well. It doesn't make a difference if I grab the wrist. So she goes to lock kimura, we go in, we strip. She goes to lock now, I have control over the hand, and now we can tuck that hand in nice and tight. You can put it inside of her own leg, make it hard. Now assuming she does lock kimura, the first thing I have to make sure of, it doesn't go high on my back. It's going to be almost useless from here to lock your hands in this position, because the lock is so weak because of the configuration of your leg, she just gives a quick jerk and it's broken. So the second I see this, we just go in and we put our hand behind your own knee and we grab the handle that is our hamstring. Now when she gets to put the hand behind the back, this will not stop her from doing so. It will delay her. But when she extends the body and pulls the hand, it's going to come out eventually. It's only a delaying tactic. So from here, I use this to go in and start trying to strip my partner's grip off. It's hard to access the hand with my hands from here once the hands are locked. I have to do my best of getting control over my partner's forefingers, the knuckle line, like so, and then turning my pinky in towards my own body and stripping her grip. So when she goes to keep a strong grip, we just turn her hand out like so, and we break her grip off. It's going to be hard to strip the thumb on this hand because we don't have the right angle. So we go in and we catch like so. She goes to start breaking me and we turn the thumb out and away. So she does lock the kimura first. We always go in, we catch the wrist, we separate. This time she locks kimura and I want to go behind my back so I step a leg up. She goes to start breaking me from here. It's only a delaying tactic. So I go and I grab over my partner's thumb line. I grab over my partner's knuckle line. When I do so, I start peeling back the pinky knuckle. She goes to lock up tight. I rotate. I peel back the pinky knuckle. And now from here, we can go in. We can start monitoring my partner's wrist, making it harder for her to connect her hands. Now we can go into all of our defenses. So stripping the kimura when she's trying to initially put it in and then stopping it from going behind my back right away and her breaking me immediately as soon as she has the kimura. So now the kimura is in, it's behind my back. There's a crisis about to emerge because you're about to get your elbow dislocated. Like this is a very, very mechanically tight kimura and it's very hard to escape. If I feel the kimura goes behind my back, you have to instantly roll through and do everything you possibly can to get that hand back in front of your body. The hand is behind your body and you're in a trimura, you're an inch away, a second away from getting broken. So this time, she has me in that trimura. She puts her shin across my back and she locks the kimura in place. From here, the second I see this, she's going to be looking to start pulling her right elbow down towards the floor like so and most people will be pushing the hand up towards the head. The second I see this, I immediately have to look to go with it. Now it's hard to go with it because of the fact that your partner has their legs pointing in the opposite direction. So they know that you're going to try to roll up and over the body. They're going to point their legs to their left. So it's going to be hard. The second I see this, I quickly open up my left hip like so and I just capitulate down to my left shoulder. So as she goes to break me, I pull my partner across like so and now we land in a situation where my hand is back in front of my body. She still has kimura and she still has triangle, but I can lock my hand from here. From here, now my hand is back in front of my own body. We can reach up and we can grab our partner's thumb. Separate the kimura. Once the kimura is separated, now I have some breathing room. The triangle is not going to be there because the hantaisen kakko wasn't set up for the triangle. It was set up for the kimura. So the angle is wrong here. Now from here, it depends on where your partner goes. Most likely, she'll be trying to scoot out and transition to a shiro senkaku. Let's see what that looks like. Like so, I make an adjustment. But that is our time to escape. If our partner stays in this position, she doesn't have the ability to strangle me. Now we can start spreading hands to the inside. We can start bringing hands inside. We can start bringing knees up and connecting knees and elbows. So there's no strangle and there's no kimura now. Because now I can get my partner's thumb, the angle is different. If my partner goes to transition to a shiro senkaku, we start bringing hands inside. As she loosens up her legs to make that transition, we free the head and now we're out of the way. So if I feel at any point that my hand goes behind my back, that is the time for you to roll through immediately, change the angle and get to the thumb now on your partner's kimura grip. So she locks up. He goes to try more. The second I see this, I immediately open up my hip and I just whip myself down to my back over my left shoulder. So she goes to start breaking me. She's pointing her knees left. She doesn't want me to roll to my left. So she points her knees left. She goes to start breaking me. We just whip ourselves down like so. And now from here, we go in and we catch our partner's thumb here. When she goes to put pressure on that kimura, she can still finish me from here. I grab the thumb. She goes to finish me. I strip the grip. Now once the grip is stripped, she's trying to relock my hand straight now. It's hard. My hand starts coming inside. Once my hand's inside, I lock up. Even if the triangle's fully locked. Hand can come inside now because the angle's different. We lock up our hands. Now when she goes to keep me controlled, it's a pretty easy thing to start walking out and away. The hand comes in. She goes to start moving to her shiro senkaku. And there's too much space. So the second you feel the hand go behind your back, just immediately roll down to a hip. If the hand goes behind the back and you stay belly down, you're going to get broken. Go belly up. Change the angle of the triangle. That changes the angle of the whole move in itself. That allows you to get to the thumb of her kimura grip. Strip the kimura and then find out of whatever triangle you find yourself in next. All right, so what's our endgame here? Again, this one comes down to time too because this kimura is not really something that you can just let yourself break in and then continue a fight. Most of the time when you get your elbow dislocated from a kimura, especially one this mechanically strong, it usually stays dislocated. So you could technically still continue fighting, but you're going to have a completely dislocated arm and you're going to have one arm to fight with. This is the next level below a triangle. It's almost just as good because they just can't physically continue to fight most of the time. But it just comes down to time. Can I strip the kimura grip before my partner ends up breaking me? So the endgame is always going to be if I have a kimura in place like so and my partner can't strip the kimura grip before I break her, it's going to be bad from here. My partner tries to fall down to her left hip. If I can point my knees to my left and pull my right knee into my chest and she goes to fall, even if she goes to fall and it's a labored fall, she can always fall down the way she has to, but even if it's a labored fall, as she's falling, she's getting broken. So understanding is always going to be a race from here. So as the kimura is getting locked a lot of the times, and I'm trying to go into defensively, get to the wrist or whatever the case is, as the kimura is getting locked, I'll preemptively roll. If I can't get, so let's say I go in, I control the wrist. She grows in, she grabs my wrist, she strips it. From here, we go in, I try again. As the hands are coming in, you feel like you can't get to the wrist. Maybe it's way up here. You can't even access the hand. Whenever I see this, right from here, before the kimura is even locked, now go to a defensive roll. Exactly. So now I have the kimura in place, and now from here, she can get to my thumb, and now she can use that to strip the hand off from here, and now she can go into a defense. But the end game is always going to come down to, can she roll to bottom position and strip the grip before I can actually go in and break her? And a lot of times the answer to this is to go into a preemptive roll right as the kimura is locked, but there's no pressure on it. If the kimura is already locked and then you try to roll, a lot of times you get broken on the way through. So the responsibility is on you to have the correct timing down when someone's trying to actually break your arm with a kimura to recognize, can I defend this and strip the grip while I'm belly down, or do I have to roll belly up and then immediately strip the grip as we're belly up and then fight out of other various triangles? But it's always going to come down to time. Can your partner break you, get the hand behind the back with proper mechanics before you can either strip the grip or roll belly down or belly up to strip the grip. All right, so now the other side of this coin with hantai senkaku is not the kimura, but the actual strangle itself. And so as I spoke about before, what the offensive man needs in order to actually enact a strangle is to invert that knee. If they can't invert that knee, they only have access to a kimura, they don't have access to an actual strangle from here. So the question is, how can I stop my opponent from inverting the knee to a situation where they actually have strangling power? Because ultimately what it comes down to, if I go for hantai senkaku, is we go in, we have an initial front triangle, maybe we switch to hantai senkaku, we can't expose the wrist, whatever the case is, we want to move to a strangle. The question is, how can I invert my knee enough so that I can get my hips on the opposite side here of my partner's neck? That's what actually does the strangling. So in order to get my hips on the side of the neck here, right now it's the inside of my thigh, I have to hit a good inversion of that left knee. And now my hips connect to my partner's neck, now I lock up, it's a strangle. So what has to happen here is my left knee inverts, my left hip inverts, and my right hip rises. If those can't happen, you can't get strangled. So whenever I see my partner going to make a switch from a mote senkaku, a front triangle, to a hantai senkaku, we always monitor that hip. So if she has front triangle, and from here she can't finish with a front triangle, she goes to make that inversion. This hip has to rise. So as she goes to invert that knee, I grab the hip. Now when she goes to invert that knee, no matter how close she gets, I can always pull the hip back. So when she goes to make that inversion, she goes to use a pendulum, whatever the case is, I control that hip. I make it hard for her to invert that knee, I make it hard to go in and actually enact that strangle. So whenever you see, even if she gets fully inverted, I grab the hip, my whole thing from here is to try to pull that hip down so that knee isn't as inverted. The further the knee inverts, and the higher this hip that I'm grabbing is, the more strangling power she's going to have. So my whole thing is to grab that hip and to pull the hip down so that knee is no longer inverted. And you can do this as she's making the transition from front triangle to side triangle, you can do this once it's already locked, it's not as effective once it's already locked obviously, but you can do this once it's already locked, and you can look to pull that hip down so the knee isn't inverted, then you force your partner into a scenario where they only have the option for the Kimura, they don't have the option for the strangle. So that's a relatively early defense, you can use it in all stages, but relatively early, where I pull the hip and I deny her the ability to invert that knee. All right, so now let's talk about we're in the strangle, we're getting strangled, and the legs are so tight that pulling the hip is just not working anymore. So now we're going to look to throw the hand across and actually convert to a front triangle, because the main disadvantage you have when you're fighting defensively out of a Hantai Senkaku is that you have no ability to use the stepover method because of the angle, your partner's inverted underneath you essentially. So you can't throw your legs over and try to shoulder walk backwards. So my favorite thing to do when someone has a tight Hantai Senkaku and I feel like I'm getting strangled is to force the hand across the center line and make them convert back to a front triangle. And as they're making that conversion, it gives you the time. Again, time is always the most important thing here, it's always the X factor. That switch of the legs will take some pressure off the strangle, so now you have a few more seconds and it will take them time to switch their legs back to a front triangle. So I force them into a front triangle because you can't hit Hantai Senkaku if the elbow moves across the center line. So I willingly move my elbow across the center line and then as they're transitioning back to a front triangle, I stand up and I use the stepover method. Okay? So this is getting very complicated here, but this is the sequence of events which will get you out provided that pulling on the hip won't work and provided you're getting strangled with Hantai Senkaku. Okay? So what you'll find is she inverts the knee and she locks Hantai Senkaku up. Whenever I see this, I pull the hip and I shoot my hand from here all the way across. You'll see it's hard for her to keep a triangle locked when I shoot my hand across here. And now from here, as she goes to make the transition, I either one, pull right on the knee like so, or two, as she goes to switch her legs, that gives me time now to start standing up and then from here I can block my partner's scoop. I can sit back. Now we can start firing legs over and going for our escapes or all of our escapes from front triangle. So I cast my elbow across the center line and I forced her to convert back to front triangle. I used that front triangle conversion as time, will give me time to either stand up or to use a knee pull method. It will be situational depending on what you want to do, whatever your reaction your partner gives, how you feel at the time, you know, how all happening quickly. So maybe you throw the leg across and you go right to a knee pull. Maybe you stand up, whatever the case is, but it'll get you out of the Hontai Senkaku. So she inverts. I grab the hip, she's strangling me, we shoot the hand across. Now from here, as she shoots the hand across, we circle towards the head and convert back to front triangle. Right from front triangle, we immediately either one, bring the elbow across like so, and I stand up or two. If she pulls the knees into the chest like she should, we go right back into that knee pull method, take the hand inside and now we're out. Okay. It's a very hard thing. Even with the size difference, she's strangling here. She goes to pull the hip and as she pulls the hip, she circles towards my head and she shoots that across. And now from here, I have to make the adjustment. My legs are unlocked and now she can use that to make the conversion back to front triangle and she's out. Okay. So this is getting kind of squirrely now, but understand this is what you should be doing if you're in a fully locked Hontai Senkaku, the hip pulls not working, legs are in too deep, invert it back to a front triangle, then fight out of a front triangle with various other methods. So for those of you who have watched attacking from top pins, we're going to make, we're drawing an interesting parallel here. When I went through attacking top pins and we isolated the bicep from a top side control and we're going to look to slide to a Shiro Senkaku. We played a dilemma game between if my partner stays facing belly up, we go into a Shiro Senkaku. So if we go in here, we step over, however it may be, we get to a situation like this, my partner stays facing belly up, we just scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot. And we end up with a Shiro Senkaku. Whether we lock a Kimura, however, obviously it looks a lot more pretty than that. So I'm explaining it, but we scoot around the corner and we end up with a Shiro Senkaku with our right knee on the floor. And then we play a dilemma. And this is a dilemma I hit with Hala Kureishi, where I went for a Shiro, he rotated on top of me and I finished him with a Hantai Senkaku. So if at any point we go in like so, we get to this position, we're trying to go for a Shiro and your partner explodes on top of you, you invert the knee and you finish with Hantai Senkaku. So the Hantai Senkaku is set up to be finished from bottom position, whereas the Shiro Senkaku is set up to be finished from top position. So now we're going to kind of overlap these and we're going to force our partner to transition to a Shiro Senkaku by rolling belly down. Because the Hantai isn't really set up to finish when we roll through and we put myself and my partner facing belly up. So we're going to fall to bottom position and we're going to make our partner make a transition to a Shiro Senkaku. And we're going to use that adjustment period, that time, to get hands inside and start to free ourselves from the triangle. So the Shiro Senkaku is not really meant to finish when you're both facing belly down, and the Hantai Senkaku really isn't made to finish when I'm facing belly up. So this is a kind of a parallel we're drawing here between top pins and this escape instructional. So she goes in, she inverts the knee, she locks up. From here, we immediately, she has a scoop of my leg, we immediately from here fall into this belly up position like so. And now we just take a V-grip on our partner's leg and a second V-grip on our partner's leg like so. Now you see all this space that's being created in here. If she stays in this position, there's no reason why I can't take my hands inside and then look to start bringing my knees up, my left knee will come up, and I'll wedge my left knee inside my own wrist. And I'll use a combination of a push of my left knee, a push of my hands, and when she goes to start, when she goes to start keeping her legs locked, this will inherently push my elbow against the lock of her legs. So when she goes to keep everything locked up, it's a push of my two hands, a push of my left elbow, and a pulling of my right elbow down. So as my right hand, the lower portion of my hand extends, the upper portion of my arm pulls down. So my elbow comes down into the lock as my hand and lower half of my arm, my forearm, move away. So when she goes to lock everything up tight, we can easily separate the legs with that knee inside the wrist, two hands pushing, and my elbow pulling directly into the lock. So my partner knows this. So the second we find ourselves in this Hathaisankhaka, there's no strangling power, and I'm going to escape from here. So from here, when she goes to scoot her knee to the floor, I stop it with this V-grip. Now she'll be posting a hand out on the floor usually, and she'll look to start making that turn by unlocking the legs. She wants to do is unlock the legs. She'll unlock the legs, she'll invert that knee, and now she can go into strong strangulations. But when the angle is wrong, and we're kind of in this hybrid between it's not really a Hathaisankhaka anymore because we're facing belly up, and it's not really a Shirasankhaka because her knee's not on the floor. When I see this, she has a triangle lock. When she goes to start scooting that knee towards the floor, I just post it so it can't move towards the floor, and now I look to circle my head away from the knee. So I can exploit the space now between her unlocked legs. So when she goes to start making that space, you just scoot the head out to the floor. And once the head is out to the floor, now you're free, you're ready to bring everything back to the inside position, and then at least recover and go into your attacks if possible. Okay? So similar to the dilemma, where if we're on top attacking from top pins, the Oshirasankhaka is really built for you to finish on top when you're both facing belly up. The Hathaisankhaka is really made to finish when your opponent moves to face belly down. And so reverse engineering this kind of, when my partner locks a Hathaisankhaka on top, we're going to go belly up. So then a Hathaisankhaka isn't really mechanically fit to finish in that position. So she'll have to transition to an Oshirasankhaka by unlocking the legs, and that's our time to escape. Okay? I know this is getting complicated, but trust me, it works. So she goes in, she locks a Hathaisankhaka, I'm getting strangled, it's no good from here. From here I immediately just fall down to my left hip, like so. Once I'm on my left hip, the triangle's locked, but when she goes to finish from here, the angle is different. She won't be able to finish me because I'm facing belly up. From here, hand comes inside, I lock my hands the best I can. We won't always be able to get palm to palm, that's okay. Once the hands are connected, in some fashion, left knee comes up. Now as she goes to lock up tight, we just extend the legs with the two arms, and my elbow pulls down into the lock of her legs. So she goes to lock up, I can always separate legs. She will have to, from here, start scooting this knee to the floor, make a transition to a Shiro, where now she can strangle me. As she goes to make that transition, I'm looking to exploit the space between her unlocked legs with my head. So my feet scurry towards the side that her knee is on, that I'm V-gripping. Once she goes to start scooting, the knee can't come to the floor, and now my head's out and away, and I'm gone, and I'm out for the win. So we force her to convert from a Huntai Senkaku to a Shiro Senkaku by rolling into a belly up position, where the Huntai Senkaku really isn't fit for finishing, but a Shiro Senkaku is. We use that transition from Huntai Senkaku to a Shiro Senkaku to exploit the looseness in the legs, the opening of the legs, and then scoot her head out and away, and then go into escapes and counterattacks. All right, so now this Huntai Senkaku, endgame is always going to come down to time. There will be an occasional time where you try to shove your hand across, and you try to pull the hip down, and the angle is just so good that you won't have enough time to be able to convert it back to a front triangle, and you're in a fully locked triangle here. You have someone who's good, the mechanics are good, they keep the knee inverted. Maybe you've got to pull the hip down, and they're stripping the hand off the hip, and you're trying to pummel back the hip and pull it down and shoot your hand across, and there's not enough time, you get submitted. This is a perfect example of how this can happen. So if I'm here, I'm strangling her, and she's strangling. She's trying to shoot her hand across, she's trying to pull my hip down, but I have this hand up here, and I control her hand, and she's trying to pummel it, and I get control of it, and there's just not enough time, and the hips come in, and she eventually gets strangled. This is a perfect example. Another great example is from here. We go in, she goes to roll belly down, and as she goes to roll belly down, I point. Go ahead. I go in, and I follow her into a position where I come up on top of her like so. And now from here, even though we're not belly down, or even though we're belly up rather, I can come up and I can tuck my leg underneath, and I can follow her into a situation where now I can go back into this belly down position, and I can strangle her. So she can roll all the way through, and instead of converting to Oshiro, I can come up and use her momentum to do a second roll, and now she's strangling the whole way through, and she can get strangled, or I can hit a second roll, and now you don't have enough time to maybe hit one roll, and maybe hit a second roll, maybe hit a third roll, maybe you get out. Maybe hit one roll, you're strangling, they roll through again, and then you're back belly down. You try to roll a second time, but halfway through the roll, the strangle's too tight, and you have to tap. Okay, so this is a perfect example of time leading to an end game. Then you hit the escapes in the proper amount of time before the strangle comes on, and you have to tap. What happened? Your massive body just fell into me. You gonna be okay? God, it's gonna be fine. You haven't struggled for a while with this over a stay? Yeah, because look at your side, it's a little bit fine. You know why? Because I do standing positions, and he does like this, and my wrist got compromised. I'm sorry about your little wrist, okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine. All right, so now let's go into intro to Oshiro Senkaku. Oshiro Senkaku's back triangle is commonly set up from, most commonly from attempted deep half guard on your opponent's behalf, or they trap an arm from the back, and you try to scoot down, and you end up in a back triangle. Okay? Now, when you're in a back triangle, it's not just a strangle you have to worry about. There's a multitude of other things you have to worry about with your arms being attacked. Okay? So, when you get into Oshiro Senkaku, your opponent is always looking to, again, find a situation where they can get the knee down to the floor. Actually, switch hands. They can get the knee down to the floor, like so, and they can start strangling you. There's also arm bar situations from here. There's American lock situations from here. There are cow hand, wrist lock situations from here. There are Kimura situations from here. So you have a strangle to deal with, you have a Kimura to deal with, you have an arm bar to deal with, you have an American lock to deal with, and you have a wrist lock to deal with. So there's five submissions off of this, and your partner will be playing dilemmas between various different strangles and arm attacks to get a breakthrough with one or the other. So you get into a little bit hairy situation here, where now bridges have no effect, you can't use any kind of step over methods, and you're running into some real trouble here with this Oshiro Senkaku. So first we're going to go into some early, early defenses, when they're trying to palm the legs in place. Then, once the triangle's fully locked, going into defenses individually on arm bars, American locks, etc., etc., and then we'll move through some common transitions your partner will hit and how you have to play between defending the strangle, clearing grips, pulling the elbow down, going to escapes, and move through a realistic scenario that you can expect against a high level person. So now, of course, many situations where your partner can transition to Oshiro Senkaku from a hantai Senkaku, from deep half guard, or from your back, whatever the case is. You'll always see a couple things happening. Number one, you'll feel your head being shelved on your partner's leg. Number two, you will see your partner's hamstring up and over your shoulder. So my partner goes to start moving to Oshiro Senkaku from any given position. The second you feel that your head is being shelved on your partner's thigh or your partner's leg and you see that hamstring starting to cover your shoulder and you're in this position, you're like, okay, now I'm starting to move into back triangles. This is very clear from the two most common positions your partner can start to set them up from, which is deep half guard, where I'm in half guard, and I start to scoop my partner's leg and she starts to slide underneath my head. Now my head is shelved and now from here maybe she locks a Kimura so I can't turn to bottom position. She pulls a leg up and over, and now from here my head is shelved and she has a hamstring over my shoulder and now I'm like, okay, the legs aren't locked, but I'm in Oshiro Senkaku territory. Or maybe from here she has a hand trapped from the underhook side, and from here I don't want to get strangled. She has two hooks in, and from here I'm trying to not get strangled. I'm trying to move down my partner's body and get my neck out of the way. And from here I start to move down to a situation where now the hamstring is up and over my shoulder, she starts converting to the opposite side, my head is shelved, and now we're in Oshiro danger. Okay? So understand and recognize that when your head gets shelved and you're both belly up, your head gets shelved and that takes away a lot of your bridging power, and you start to see that hamstring cover your shoulder, it's going to be an issue. Okay? So the first thing I want to do, whenever I see my head being shelved, and from here, as my head is shelved and my shoulder's covered, I want to recognize that we're now moving into Oshiro Senkaku territory. Okay? Understand that from here, this move will only work if your partner's heel is inside your shoulder. Right now, my shoulder's out here, and you can clearly see that heel is now inside my shoulder. So from this position, before the legs are locked, I'm going to take my hand and I'm going to bring it inside my partner's heel. Now from here, I shoot my hand forward as my elbow comes inside the heel, and then the shoulder comes inside the heel. And now from here, before the legs are locked, I put weight over my partner's leg by getting my shoulders up and over the leg, and I raise my hips up in the air. When she goes to move that leg now, shrimp around, it's going to be hard. And now from here, I just walk. Same thing that we did with our shoulders before. One, two, three, four. I just shoulder walk as she goes to make an adjustment. One, two, three, four. And I post on the leg. And now from here, you're out of the triangle, and then you have to fight to get top position, or get Ashi Garami as your partner starts coming on top of you. So from here, the second I see my head is shelved, we're belly up, we're in our Shiro Senkaku territory, and my shoulder's covered. Before the legs are locked, this is your time to start recognizing danger. You're not in a triangle yet. Your partner doesn't have legs locked. If she has legs locked, like so, now we're starting to get later and later into escapes. If she has legs in a semi-senkaku, now we're starting to get later and later into escapes because the legs are actually locked. There's actually a closed wedge now around my head and my arm. Here the legs are unlocked. She'll be trying to adjust and make transitions. Whenever I see this, we go in and we take a hand inside. We can also grab over our partner's heel, like so, temporarily. So that if I feel like I can't get the hand inside it, let's say I'm going to put the hand inside, and I feel like if I try to do that, she's just going to lock her legs. If from here I feel like I'm a little bit late, and I can't get my hand inside first, I'll just grab the heel. Now when she goes to lock the legs, I won't be able to get my shoulder inside because my hand isn't inside. I'm grabbing it from the outside. The hand has to come inside. But I can stop her initially as she goes to lock the legs, and I can open up this leg a little bit. And now I can start putting weight on my partner's legs. When she goes to lock now, it's much harder to lock the triangle. Now as she's fiddling around with the legs and trying to lock the triangle, I come to the inside, and I just punch my shoulder forward. I do this by taking my hips off the floor and using a strong bridging motion to shoot my left shoulder far forward to punch the shoulder inside and slip my partner's calf muscle off my shoulder. Okay? And when she goes to start locking up, this is what I want. And then it's one, two, three, four. And I'm out and away, and I'm ready to go into all of our escapes. Okay? So we're going to recognize that from any given position, we're facing belly up. And we know this person, let's go deep half. We know this opponent has good back triangles. So I'm going deep half, and I feel, whoop, my partner starts shelving my head. That's no good. And now I feel, whoop, I feel my partner's leg is now covering my shoulder. And she locks Kimura, starts tilting to the side, and the leg comes out. And I'm like, man, this is no good. So the second I see this, we take that hand to the inside, and from here, we start shooting everything to the inside position. And now from here, we walk, walk, walk, and we're out, ready to make our escapes in all of our counterattacks. So before the legs are locked, we address them by taking our hand, our elbow, and our shoulder to the inside position. It's always a battle of that inside shoulder position. If she has her heel inside the shoulder, you're going to have a hard time. She's going to lock those legs. If you have your shoulder inside that heel, she won't be able to lock the legs in a way that she can actually hold you and finish you from there. Okay. So that's an early escape and just recognizing danger. Now let's look at early escapes and some escapes when our partner is trying to attack our arms. And then we'll go into the worst escape, which is when our partner has a strangle lock, and I'm actually getting strangled from here. So there's always going to be a variety of things your partner will try. Many times, it's harder than a front triangle or other various triangles to finish a strangle on Oshiro Senkaku, and many people have terrible mechanics. So actually, most people are more inclined to attack your arm rather than to attack the strangle itself. So your partner locks a triangle, a lot of times it's just to attack the arms and the mechanics really aren't there. We have to be able to address all of these. Okay. So when she locks up an Oshiro and she goes to lock up Kimura. As she locks Kimura from here, just take this off a little bit. I don't want to just be squeaking at you guys, so we'll just be here for now. When she locks Kimura, the whole thing with Kimura is to fight the grip. If you lock your hands and you have someone who has good mechanics on Kimura, maybe you'll survive depending on the flexibility of your shoulder and the angle that she's trying to finish the Kimura with, but it's just not recommended. It's way, you know, your hands are going to get tired, your forearms are going to fatigue. It's just, there's so much easier ways to go about this. The second I feel someone lock a Kimura, instead of locking my hands, address the grip. I just reach up and I just find my partner's thumb right here. Now the second she goes to put any kind of lock on the Kimura, I just strip the hand off. And now from here, she has no Kimura. So if she has her legs locked, this is what it'll look like. She'll have Kimura. If she goes to start finishing me from here and I lock, and my shoulders aren't very flexible, I'm going to get finished. So I just address the grip. Now when she goes to finish, she can't put any pressure because I have her hand controlled. She can't move this hand. So when she goes to finish from here, you strip the grip. And now from here, I take my hand and I catch my partner's wrist, unlock, I catch my partner's wrist and now from here, we can use that to pull the elbow down and start to lock up. So now that we've locked up the elbows down here, now we can start to go into our escapes, which we'll look at in a little while. The second I feel Kimura is locked, I never lock my hands. There's just way better ways to do things from here. Like I said, you can't survive if you're a big strong guy and your partner has pretty shitty mechanics, but this will always be much better. So when she goes to finish from here, I just strip the grip at the thumb. And now from here, we just reach up, we take an inside wrist grip, we strip that, our hand comes inside, and then we pull the elbow down and we're ready to make way into our escapes. So whenever I see Kimura being locked, just strip the grip of the thumb, control the thumb, that will take away the pressure immediately, allow you to strip a grip on someone twice your size and you can fight out of Kimura, not get broken and then work towards an escape of the actual triangle. All right, so when your partner has a Shirosenkaku, it's locked up and they have you in an armbar, it is a very difficult thing to deal with. And if you deal with it, you run into a different problem, which is the American lock, which we have to deal with next. So let's first look at a shitty armbar versus a good armbar. And to be honest, I don't really have an adequate defense to a good armbar when they have control of your thumb, but this will make more sense in a second. So she has me in a strangle, triangle's locked and she's using the triangle for control. Now if from here she has just my wrist controlled like so, and she's just controlling my wrist, I can start walking away from the lock of the legs and I can turn my thumb down in this direction. So when she gets to break me over her right hip, the angle's wrong. This will bring me into an American lock, which you have to deal with in a second. Understand if your partner grabs your thumb like we talked about before, and now she controls the thumb, I won't be able to turn my elbow and my thumb down. If your hand's extended in this direction, she has a fully locked triangle, this here is probably your end game. What I can try to do is escape, I have to try to escape the strangle the way that I would here, but just turning the arm without unlocking the triangle is going to be very hard to escape from here. So what I generally recommend is if you're in a juji and you feel like your partner just has the wrist, you can turn the thumb down and take a little bit of the pressure off. But if she can keep your thumb pointing in the right direction, now my arm, I'm not going to escape with my arm, I'm going to escape by unlocking the triangle, which is what we're going to look to do in a little while. Understand you have to recognize what kind of juji it is. If it's a shitty one and she just has control of the wrist like most people do, I just walk away from the legs and I turn everything down, which now brings me into an American lock, but I can at least take pressure off the arm bar while I'm looking to separate the legs. Now, if she has this grip and she controls my thumb, I have to completely forget about the arm bar. The whole thing now is to focus on separating the legs, which we'll look to do in a minute, but I just have to let my arm go, try to move my thumb, give her trouble, either pull my arm back towards me or turning my thumb the best I can to make it hard for her to give her some motion towards an escape. So she's not just holding me in a static position willingly. And as I'm looking to move, she goes to break me. I'm giving her trouble from here to control me and then I look to start separating the legs. All right. But if you don't separate the legs and from here, she just pushes up and over that's end game from there. You're not going to be able to turn your thumb and your elbow into the correct positions and you're going to get broken. So dealing with a good arm bar, you got to unlock the legs. Dealing with a shitty arm bar, you can kind of turn down to an American lock and deal with that problem. And we're going to deal with that problem as it comes up next, which is what we're going to look at. All right. So now whether you turned out of an arm bar or whether your arm gets bent, however you end up in this American lock Americana, we have to look at ways to defend this. Now, when your partner is using this American lock finish, the way they're actually going to break you is by using opposing forces where one hand pushes on the wrist and one hand pulls on the elbow, so you get a couple force to actually break the arm. Okay. And when we're in this situation and we're down here and we find ourselves with a situation where we're not going to get arm barred, but the American lock is coming into place. And now from here, she's pushing one arm and she's pulling on the elbow. This is where I'm going to get broken. So it's going to be hard for me to reach up because of this leg to actually get to the far arm. All right. So I'm going to have to use the hand on my wrist because as I got to reach up, there's just a wedge here in place that won't allow me to reach my hand no matter how flexible you are over your head. So from here, I can always pull my elbow down the best I can. I can get to my partner's thumb on this side and I can strip this grip. So now from here, when she goes to push, she can push, push, push. I can always move my hand back out and turn my thumb away. So now from here, I go back into the arm bar, which is not great, obviously, but now my arm is extended and now I can play back and forth between Americana and arm bar and a combination of escapes there as I go into separating my partner's legs. Because ultimately what's going to get me out is separating my partner's legs from the triangle. So I'm in American lock. I defend. She goes to push the wrist to break it. I extend. Now she goes to move back into an arm bar and now I can turn back down into an American lock and so on and so forth. And this may give me this transition. I may move back and forth one or two, maybe three transitions, but that's five seconds. That's 10 seconds, depending on how good your partner is. And in that time allowed, that can lead us to start separating the triangle, which we need. So I can keep my partner distracted up here. She goes to start finishing me and I'm fighting my legs. She gets to break me. I strip. And now from here, she goes to transition back. Now I can start separating my partner's legs. So you play defensively at the upper body, but your main goal is going to be to separate these legs, which is what we're going to look at in a minute. So just giving you defensive reactions to stop your partner from immediately breaking you up here. And then we're going to look at how we can go in and actually get ourselves out of the position by separating the legs. But you're going to go back and forth now between defending the Americana, the American lock and the Jujutsu Kaisen, the arm bar. So when you defend one, you run to the other. You defend one, you run to the other. And then as you're doing that, you're stripping grips, you're making adjustments and your partner's focused on the upper body finishing with the arm. And the whole time I strip a grip, I go to the legs. I strip a grip, I go to the legs. I turn my elbow back and forth and I'm trying to peel the legs. Okay. This is how you can not get finished immediately when your partner gets a hold of your arm. And then once you can not get finished immediately, then we can look to go in and start separating our partner's legs and eventually escaping the position. All right, so because Sonny has a compromised wrist, I think we should just do wrist locks on you for this clip. Yeah, no worries. I can do it. No, I'm just kidding. So now wrist locks, I don't really usually give much credit to because when people show wrist locks, it's like some bullshit standing one where like, oh, he grabs my shirt and then I break his wrist. It's like, no, that's never going to work. You need legitimate control of the joint above the joint you're attacking in order to actually break that joint. So if I'm attacking the wrist, I need legitimate control of the elbow. If I'm attacking the elbow, I need legitimate control of the shoulder. If I'm attacking the knee, I need control over the hip. Okay. And so on and so forth. With the wrist lock from Oshiro Senkaku, my elbow is completely trapped inside the triangle. So you can get legitimately catastrophic breaks on someone's wrist to the point where they can't use their wrist anymore in a fight or are at least severely injured through this Oshiro Senkaku and wrist lock cow hand dilemma here. So my partner has me locked up and at any point she can put a bend in my wrist. Should I sit down? Yeah, you can sit up. She puts a bend in my wrist and from here it gets hand over hand, chin over hand. My elbow can't move now. So when she starts to rotate everything in towards my thumb, she can break me. The second I see this, good. The second I see this, she goes to put her hand over hand. The second I see this, we reach over and we catch the thumb of the bottom hand. If I just go into the top hand, she just strips and then she just replaces it and the whole time she's breaking me with her chin in good position and her other hand. So I reach up and I grab specifically the thumb of the bottom hand. So when she goes to break me, I pull the hands towards me and I give a slight extension of my own hand towards her face and this strips the grip off and now from here we're ready to go. This can't be just like it looks obvious when I say to you, but it can't be just like a random thing where I just reach up and grab. I grab specifically over the thumb. That's why I'm showing you guys this. So when she goes to break me, I don't just reach and grab any wrist. I don't just pull here. It's hard to pull, so it's hard to pull here, but when I grab the thumb at the long end of the lever and she goes to keep everything in, it's an easy grip break. Okay, I don't want to make work harder than it has to be for yourself. Yes, if I'm strong and I grab the wrist and I pull hard, lock up, I pull hard, I could probably break the grip eventually, but you're working at the short end of the lever. It's much harder and you could get injured in this time. Time is always a thing here when we're in submissions. So I go and I grab up nice and high with the long end of the lever. She goes to break me, I just strip. And now from here, we have our hands in place. I'm ready to go in, start playing defensively, separating legs, however they are locked or unlocked, whatever the case is. And then we can go in and start separating our partner's legs and going into our escapes. So defending the wrist lock by grabbing specifically right over the thumb, stripping the grip, then flicking your hand in the opposite direction. Take that grip off and go back to trying to unlock the legs. Now we're looking at triangle escapes. If your partner just focused on the triangle or any way to untangle the figure four and to start to pummel that shoulder to the inside position. So this is going to be something that you're going to be half to doing. You're going to have to be doing if your partner strangling you and you're just going to go unconscious or if your partner is attacking your arms in any of the ways we just looked at, you have to defend your arm first. And then if your arm does get into a situation where it's compromised, forget the arm. Like if your partner has a good arm bar, forget about the arm and just focus on separating the legs. So this is a kind of a sticky situation here where you're moments away from getting broken or strangled unconscious. You can't step over, you can't bridge, none of these things have any effect. And it's just going to be you trying to separate their legs. All right, so now she's a full triangle lock and she's attacking my arms. And again, as she's attacking my arms from here, I'm looking to go and I'm looking to strip grips. I'm looking to start pulling hands down, looking to start getting my elbow the best I can down towards here. The lower my elbow is, the less strength, the less ability she has to strangle me. You see my voice when she goes to squeeze tight from here, the lower my elbow is, the better my voice is. When my elbow comes high and she squeezes tight from here, you see it's very, very tight when my elbow comes up high. So the lower my elbow is towards my shoulder line, the less strangle ability she's going to have. So the whole time I'm fighting here and she's looking to fight to break me, I'm looking to go in and start to go for a Kimura or something. The whole time I'm stripping grips and pulling the elbow down. She's going to be trying to pull that elbow up, so I'm stripping grips, stripping grips, I'm pulling the elbow down, I'm trying to hide my wrist down here somewhere. So she has to reach forward to get it. That gives me time to start separating the legs. From this position, whether my arm's up here, whether it's getting extended, whatever the case is, I'm always trying to strip grips so I don't get broken. The number one thing is you don't want to get your arm broken while you're trying to do this. So if you do find yourself in a compromising position where she has a Kimura, for example, I don't want to get my arm broken while I'm trying to do this. So I strip a grip and then the second I'm not in a compromising position where I'm on breaking point, I take my hand and I get underneath my partner's Achilles like so. Now your partner will have a strong back heel in this position. That back heel will make it hard for me just to use my hand versus her leg. So what I do is I just place my hand in the best I can. And now from here I give short, incremental bridges. One, two, three, and I just use that to flick the leg up and away. So she has a strong back heel, I take the hand in place. Now if I just try to wipe it across my body, it's never going to, it's my, her back heel versus my hand. It's never going to work. From here she goes to lock it tight and I just bridge. One, two, three, four, and I get the legs into position where now from here I just catch my partner's leg. When she goes to relock that triangle, it's not going to be an easy thing. Okay? And now from here, once I have this leg trapped, I just take my hand and I just flick it. Inside my partner's, inside my partner's heel like so. Now your partner will always try to relock the triangle. Okay? What I can't have is just my hand in here and she just relocks the triangle and my hand gets kind of caught and it slips out and then she's back in. So from here I bring my legs up. Now if my partner from here goes to relock the triangle, my legs will always get in the way. And if she goes too high, she tries to lift the leg up too high, I just go in and I trap my partner's leg like so. We'll look at that in a second. Okay? But from here, we're going to keep the legs high and we take our hand to the inside position like so. If we feel like our hand can't slip to the inside because the triangle is still too tight, that's fine. I just go in and I just grab my partner's heel like so. And now I just take a small bite on my partner's heel and we just pull. One, two, three, four. All right? Pull the heel down. Okay? It's not going to be easy. You're going to have to have a strong back heel in place, but you'll see if you go to the ankle, it won't be long enough on the lever. If you try to go to the toes, you won't be able to access them. It's going to be hard. Okay? So I go in and we just get a grip on our partner's heel like so. Okay? You can also go to the ball of your partner's foot. I can't go over the top here. This doesn't make sense. But what I can do is I can reach. I can go to the ball of my partner's foot like so. And now from here I can use that to pull as well. So whatever you can access. Again, this is a crisis moment. So whatever you can access, either the heel like so, I can reach and I can get a hold of the heel with a false grip and pull it down. Or if I can get to the ball of the foot, I can do that too. This will be determined on where your partner's foot is pointing. If your partner's foot happens to be pointing out and along the floor, it's usually easier to get to the heel and pull the heel down. If your partner's toes are pointed up towards the ceiling, the heel is kind of awkward and hard to get to, but the ball of the foot is more exposed here. So I just have to play around with it as you go and you see what feels more natural at the time. Okay, again, crisis situation. I just pull that in and I pull that on down. Now I start putting weight on my partner's leg to challenge that connection between your feet. Once I pull this heel out and away, we'll just go in and we catch the inside position. Again, you're not going to have the ability to really pull your partner's leg out as far as you think you can. She has a strong back heel. She's trying to hang on to this position. All I need is a few inches, one, two, three, four, and we're here. Now I come to the inside. Once I come to the inside, now I just shoot that left shoulder forward and then we just walk one, two, three, four, we're out, and now we're ready to go into our escapes. Okay, so that's the first one. She locks up the triangle. Again, we're up here. The only thing we're trying to do with this upper body configuration, these upper body grips, is to make sure we're not on breaking point at any point where I'm going to get catastrophically injured at the upper body. So I look at basic wiggle room escapes that I can use when my partner has everything locked up from here, but ultimately we're going to have to escape the triangle. I do this by going in, I take my hand in place. If the back heel is so tight I can't get my hand in, I bridge to get the hand in, and then I bridge another time to wipe the leg across. Now from here we go in, we catch either one, the ball of the foot, or two, the heel. Both work good. And now, one, two, three, four, I loosen everything up. I take my hand to the inside and now I just punch that shoulder to the inside position and I walk up and over my partner's leg. You will always find a time where you go to hit an escape, your hand comes in and your partner tries to flick the leg back over, and as she goes to flick the leg back over, it gets caught between your legs. Whenever I see it gets caught between my legs, the whole thing from here is if she can pull her knees to her chest and pull that back heel in, you can still have a tight strangle from here. So I always extend my legs from this position. Once I extend my legs from this position, we just go through and look to start getting a grip over, look to go through and look to start finding a grip inside our partner's heel. You'll find that from here, if I try to go underneath, it's a hard purchase from here because my partner's legs are still technically figure forward. So from this position I reach through and I grab the heel in here. When she goes to lock up tight, you won't be able to just pull your partner's foot out because your arm versus her leg and because the legs are connected is a full figure forward. So when she locks up tight, just a pull won't work. So I pendulum my legs in one direction and then I pull with my hand in the other. When she goes to lock up, we just take everything out and now we can separate the legs easy. Now because her leg is trapped between mine, it's like a joke, it's the easiest thing in the world to get your hand and shoulder inside, then we just walk up and over the leg like we just did. So there will always be a time, many times it's as your partner is trying to set the oshiro, like maybe she locks in from a deep half guard or whatever the case is, and she goes to throw the leg across to lock and I catch it between my legs preemptively. Maybe it's not an escape, maybe I just catch it preemptively and I escape as she's going to lock. This is possible too. There's always going to be a time where I'm trying to get to an escape, she goes to take her leg back over and I just feed it between my legs. Now if you try to go under like so, purchase is going to be hard. So instead, we go over the heel this time, we catch like so. Now if I just pull left hand, it won't work. So I whip my legs of the pendulum in one direction and I pull in the opposite direction. That opposing force makes it the easiest thing in the world to start going in and scooting up and over my partner's leg for the escape. So now what do we have here? We have the ability to just finagle our upper body into spaces where we're just off breaking point long enough to go in and separate my partner's legs, separate the triangle, fight to the inside shoulder position, and then start walking, shoulder walking up and over our partner's leg to either turn the top position, end up in ashi garami, or if you mess up terribly, in bottom out. Okay? But the whole thing is just to keep yourself off breaking point long enough to separate your partner's legs. And whether you do that with a method where you simply punch the shoulder inside, or they do that with a method where you trap your partner's leg and then you punch your shoulder inside. There are a couple of different ways to go about this, but the main thing is separating your partner's legs. All right. So from here, of course, everything is time related. Your partner has a lot of attacks. They have five different main submissions they can break you with or strangle you unconscious with. The question is always going to be, can I keep my upper body out of danger long enough to separate the legs before I get broken? If the answer is no, then you have to either tap or you're going to get your arm broken. And some, whether it be Americana, that'd be Jiu-Jitsu, whatever the case is. Now if your partner is strangling you, the question is, can I separate the legs and alleviate the pressure before I get strangled? And the way that I do that, we just looked at bridging, bridging, bridging, hand comes inside and then looking to incrementally unlock the legs from figure four to semi-senkaku with crossed ankles to legs completely open and then hands come inside. So your end game again, just comes down to time. Can I separate the legs before I either get broken or get strangled unconscious? If yes, you're out. If no, you're tapping.
