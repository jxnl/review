 Alright, so now we looked at a naive opponent who allows the elbow to slip to the inside position. Now let's look at someone who's more advanced and we actually deliberately fight the far elbow to inside position using that same bridge and clearing the cross face and getting everything back to the inside. I actually used this escape in my full pro match if you guys want to reference that for some tape study. This time we're going to be down and we have an opponent who allows me to get everything to the inside position but she still has her far elbow stuck inside mine. So from here I feel like I can't go into underhooks, I feel like I can't move my partner around. Whenever I see this I feel my partner's leaning up towards my head and trying to put a heavy cross face in. The second I see this I'm just going to look away from my partner's cross face. What I can't have is an initial bridge where my partner is leaning all of her weight and I'm trying to bench press my partner off against her locked hands. It's never going to work. What I need is a situation where I look away from the cross face so that when I go to start bridging my partner's shoulder will slide along my jaw and up and over my head. If I'm looking straight up at the ceiling or looking towards my partner and I go to do this I'm just going to push her shoulder right into my jaw and it's going to be uncomfortable and I'm not going to move anywhere. So from here I just take two V-grips inside my partner's armpit like so and from this position I look towards you guys, away from my partner. As she goes to put a heavy cross face in I just give her a quick bridge and I just bump into a situation like so. Where now I go from a full bridge into a situation where I'm fully contracted like so. And now I still have my elbow in the outside position but the cross face is no longer in place. So now all I have to do is start to create an angle where I connect my left knee and left elbow and from here I start to loop my head out and through. And now I just extend my partner away, lock your hands, I extend my partner away and I just slip the right elbow to the inside. And now when she goes to put pressure on me everything comes to the inside position where we can recover in the same fashion we did before. So this time she has good elbow position and my elbow doesn't slip to the inside. She keeps her elbow in the inside position because she knows if it slips outside I'm going to recover. So whenever I see this I fight two of my hands to the inside position like so. We take two V-grips on our partner's armpit and from here we look away from our partner's cross face. If I'm looking towards my partner or up towards the ceiling the cross face becomes very heavy. My whole thing is I look away from the cross face so that when I bridge and bump the shoulder slides along my face. From here I take two feet into my butt, I give a quick bridge and I just lift slightly with my hands. Instead of bench pressing my partner I just guide her over the head with my arms. So she goes to lock up tight, I just move to this position and now I immediately bring knee and elbow together. From here as she goes to lock up I just loop my head out and around from the inside of my partner's elbows and now I extend my arm and I bring my elbow to the inside. When she goes to get control over my head the inside bicep tie stops her and now it's the easiest thing in the world to go into any of the former recoveries that we looked at before. Alright so this time just giving a quick bump and clearing our head underneath our partner's cross face. Like I said it's super super important to be able to go from a full convex position where I'm bridging and extending into a full concave position where everything comes back inside and I can go from an initial kazooshie with the bridge and then get my head underneath my partner's chest, clear the cross face and then connect knees and elbows and then subsequently fight back to the inside position. Alright so those are always going to be like our opening gambit escapes where we can test our partner if we can get two V-grips to our partner's armpit and we can quickly bridge and bring knees to elbows we can get into quick escapes and get back to the inside position. Now there's always going to be times where your partner is a good pinner and you're getting held for longer amounts of time and we have to look to use different methods of escape. Initially when we get put into side control and we can't just immediately escape we're always looking for the best leg position to lead us into an escape and assuming we can point our knees towards our partner the best option for us is always going to be locking a side guard. Now when we try to lock a side guard we need a knee and elbow connection so what I'm looking to do is I'm looking to put my knee as close to the target as possible when I'm in this bottom pin and the target is always going to be my left elbow. So what you see people doing is they post on their own leg and they cross their feet like this and they stop people from trying to mount them. Obviously you can't just be here because then your partner just steps over to mount. You can't just be here because then your partner goes into a shin mount and drives across to mount. So you see people telling you to do different things with their legs. The best option is always going to be one where you have knee to hip contact like so. I want my left knee and my left elbow connected so I want to start with my knee as close to my elbow as possible. My knee right now is connected to my partner's hip as close as possible to my elbow that I can be. If at any point from here my partner raises the hips because of that knee and hip contact you will always get an insertion inside your partner's hip with your knee. So understand that we're trying to lock a side guard from here. So what I'm looking to do is I'm looking to put my knee as close to the target as possible which is here connected to my partner's hip. So if at any point my partner makes a mistake, if my partner switches their hips in the wrong direction, if my partner raises the hips to go into a shin mount to try to start mounting me I can always go in and lock a side guard and successfully go in and escape. So just understand that when you start in a side control if you have left elbow inside your partner's hip whether you have your right arm inside or not we're always looking to move into a situation like so where my near side knee connects to my partner's hip. And now wherever your partner goes from here it's a pretty easy thing to start going in making space connecting knee and elbow and once you have that knee and elbow connection it's very likely you're going to escape. Alright let's talk about inserting a side guard. Talk about what side guard is and the importance of side guard. Let's talk about now actually moving to a side guard on our partner. Whenever I'm playing from bottom side control and I can look to start pointing my knees towards my partner the near side inside elbow is always going to be the most important frame. Why is that? Well one because of the fact that if your partner if you don't have an elbow inside your partner's hip that means there's only two places it can be. Number one it's pinned underneath your partner's shins and she has a top head and arm and now you're halfway into triangles and Kimuras and Jujitames and you're about to be submitted from here. Or two it's shelved on your partner's leg and hip where now there's nothing stopping you or nothing stopping your partner from going into a shin mount and walking into a mounted position and now as she walks into mounted position she has an arm isolated over the head. She has one arm that's halfway up there and things can start to go south from here. So this is always going to be the most important frame. It's great if I can have my far arm inside but the most important one assuming I can point my knees towards my partner will always be that near side elbow. Because now if I have near side elbow inside I can always connect knee to hip. And now when she goes to move from here she tries to submit me tries to go into mount I can always go in and lock a side guard from here. So the easiest way to lock a side guard is I just have knee to hip contact and now most people are so naive that they're going to try to move into certain positions and as they're going to move they're going to inevitably raise their hips and as their hips come up I just go in and I lock knee to elbow connection. Now this is great but again someone who knows what's going on they feel that knee to hip contact and they never raise their hips. So what can we do to actively insert a side guard here? Understand that if my knee is higher than the height of my foot if you draw a line that goes straight out from my knee in this direction if my foot is lower than that line and I try to insert my knee inside my partner's hip you'll always get caught on your partner's hip bone. So the whole thing for me is to invert my right knee similar to how we inverted the elbow by opening up our hand I want to invert my left knee so that's lower than the height of my foot and from here I just take my right foot and I use an extension of my left arm so that as I walk my hips away from my partner I can create a disconnect between my hips and my partners through the left hip through the left elbow inside post. I'm not going to say she can't follow me from here she can follow me again just walk a circle with me she can follow me but I can create enough disconnect to insert my knee inside my partner's hip because of the fact that my knee is lower than the height of my foot and now I have a knee elbow connection. In the event that I see someone's very tight and I feel like I'm walking walking walking or just walking a circle together whenever I see this I use a kipping action where my heel just pumps to and from my butt and this will create a small extra kazoo sheet and as she gets to follow me I just go in I take my knee inside now we have the inside knee position we have a side guard locked and we can start going through recoveries from here okay. So the first thing I'm looking for is to get that near elbow inside I take my knee I put it on my partner's hip that's my starting position when she goes to raise her hips side guard comes in from this position I feel like she's a little bit better so I just walk away I invert my right knee so it's lower than the height of my foot let me put everything inside this time she's very very good she goes to follow me we just kip the knee to the inside position like so and now from here once we have knee and elbow connected it's a pretty easy thing to escape. One thing I will note when you have a side guard what you don't want is for there to be space for your partner to expose your knee to their hip so what I mean by this is if she comes around on this side if I have a side guard locked and I expose my knee to her hip if she hip switches she exposes my knee to her hip she walks the knee down and away and now she creates a disconnection between my knee and my elbow so whenever I lock a side guard I always want to make sure that my knee is slightly lower than my elbow if my knee is higher than my elbow my partner can expose that knee to her hip and she can walk the knee down and away. If at any point I see my knee slip higher than the height of my elbow I have to make sure that my elbow is further forward out and away from me than my knee is so I either need to have a situation where my knee is lower than my elbow like so so when she goes to expose her the knees on the floor and might have my elbow higher than my knee or if I see my knee has pointed up towards the ceiling like so now I need to be in a position where my right elbow moves further out and away so even if she does hip switch there's no knee exposure to my partner's hip so the whole time when she's trying to expose my knee she goes to try to expose my knees the other way hip switch my knee is in the floor and from here there's no knee exposure this time my knees pointing relatively up towards the ceiling if from here my knees further out than my elbow she picks my knee and she walks it away whenever I see my knees off the floor I pull my knees by chest so that my right elbow is further forward out towards you guys than my knee is so now when she goes to switch her hips there's no hip switch she can't expose my knee and now we can lock a sideguard sufficiently so just keep in mind we do have a sideguard locked you can never expose your knee to your partner's hip if she picks the knee off with the hip you will always be in a position where she can drag your knee away from your elbow and then all of your hard work will now be compromised and you're back to square one. All right so once we've established a sideguard knee elbow connection let's look at a very basic recovery from here fighting everything back to the inside position okay and again it's just a simple battle of getting all of our limbs back to the inside if she has me in a top pin I look to start bridging and I get my right hand to the inside position I get my left elbow inside my partner's hip to the inside position I get my left knee to the inside position relative to my partner's hip and from here she goes to lock up tight we have some inside position here and she has some inside position as well from here I'm going to look to separate my partner's hands okay now there's a couple of ways that we can look to do this one the easiest way to do it is if I have my right hand on the inside position from here we just come in and we just lock our hands like so we just physically lock the ten finger grip and we keep our knee elbow connected I don't want to disconnect my knee and my elbow and however separate my knee and my elbow connection so I go and I lock my hands like so I physically step on my own foot and from here I extend everything out and away from my partner when you extend your full body your arms pushing away your legs pushing away it's the full extension of your body with most of the inside position versus the grip of her hands okay your fingertips locked when she goes to keep a strong grip you can always separate your partner's hands like so if you feel like you have a side guard lock and you bring everything inside and this time you feel like you can't pummel your right hand on the inside so your left hand gets left or your right hand gets left on the outside as you're doing this no problem if I can't pummel the right hand to the inside you usually can if I can't pummel the right hand to the inside that's fine I take my left hand once again inside my partner's shoulder I just lock a ten finger grip outside and around my partner's head like so and now use that same pushing effect where my hands are connected she goes to lock up tight I just extend my body out and away like so and we can easily take everything inside so we have the hand outside and around our partner's head or we have the hand inside our partner like so our partner's jaw like so when she goes to lock up tight from here I have a knee elbow connection I have a post on my other foot and my whole thing is just to extend my body in a straight line as I push with my arms push with my legs and I separate my partner's hands now from here I can't allow her to regain control over my head so what I'm going to look to do is I'm going to take my right elbow back to the inside position right now she still has her elbow inside so the first thing I do is I block my partner's cross face collar tie with my left hand and now I just take my right elbow and I slip it inside my partner's shoulder when she goes to drive forward from here I just use that cross shoulder post to lift and I just connect my right knee and my right elbow and now when she goes to come on to me there's no ability for her to put any weight onto my torso no ability for her to control my head and we can easily recover right from there okay so this time we get to a situation where we have a side guard locked she has a top headed on they connect a knee and elbow connection like so if I have my hand on the inside I take two hands inside and we just lock up like so if from here I have a hand on the outside we take a hand around the outside and a hand inside my partner's shoulder and they lock up like so and now from here we just step on our own foot okay as I push with my legs as I push with my arms my head it just moves out and away from my partner when she goes to hold on tight no matter what the size and strength discrepancy will be you can always separate your partner's hands it's your full extension of your body versus the lock of your partner's hands and now it's the easiest thing in the world to pommel a hand to the inside if it was on the outside and now she goes to drive forward I just slip my right elbow inside my partner's shoulder when she goes to come forward onto me she can't control my head she can't control she can't get chest to chest and then I just take my right knee back to the inside position and now I have all the inside real estate where we can fire a scissor guard into place we can fire two buttock high hooks into place we can forward shift we can have to enter our partner's legs we can do a variety of different things from there which we're going to look at right now okay but using a basic recovery from a side guard incrementally finding everything back to the inside position and getting to a full recovery into some kind of open guard all right so now we look at a basic regard from side guard now let's look at how we can go from a defensive cycle right into an offensive cycle with various attacks on our partner's upper and lower body so this time we're going to bring everything back to where we just were she's going to be in a top pin I'm going to lock a side guard whether I have a hand inside or outside sometimes you have it inside sometimes you have it outside it doesn't really make too much of a difference from here we come in we separate our partner's hands and we end up in a situation like so okay if I have my hand on the outside we're going to flip the fire into a side guard or into a clamp from here what I'm looking for is to control my partner's posture so I just grab a collar tie like so so when she goes to pull out and away she can't oftentimes the reason why this these uh these transitions work is because your partner will be so uh so excited about keeping the pin and so focused on keeping the pin that she will keep it under hook in place longer than she's supposed to okay the correct reaction for her will be the second I lock the side guard she should immediately shorten her arms and bring her elbow back inside my hip but nobody wants to unlock their hands and potentially lose a pin right so what everyone does is they hold on as long as they can and now once the hands separate now that under hook of hers becomes a liability and it's actually she's getting overextended from here and I can take advantage of that all right so she's so focused on keeping a pin a lot of times she'll leave the arm behind and I can immediately exploit that the second the hand is open so from here I switch to a collar tie if I have my hand on the inside like so and I want to switch to a clamp guard I actually take it back to the outside and I switch to a collar tie if I'm looking to control my partner's posture so she can't immediately just posture up and pull out and away so from here I switch I have hands inside whether I'm here or whether I'm here I switch to a collar tie and an inside bicep tie so when she one tries to come forward and control my head she can't because the inside bicep tie two when she tries to move out and away from me she can't because of the fact that I have a collar tie and from this position I'm just going to pull my right knee up and place it on the back of my partner's back and rear shoulder so now when she goes to pull the arm and the under hook back and away it's difficult now I take my left knee and I just slip it right inside my partner's far shoulder like so and now I can just cast my right heel over my partner's shoulder and connect my foot to my own knee and I just place a hand here on my knee we close our knee down towards the floor to control our partner's posture so now when she goes to drive towards me she can't because I've wedged inside my partner's far shoulder when she goes to posture she can't because I've wedged on top of her head when she goes to pull straight back and away she can't because her arm is wedged in place by my hip and by my thigh and now from here we can go into our full clamp series which I spoke about in closed guard so we're not going to go into clamp attacks, pin escapes instructional but you have many attacks where we can go into and start breaking our partner threatening our partner from these positions okay so we have a situation where we're trapped in a side control or I managed to lock a side guard into place like so from here we take everything back to the inside position they come through and we separate our partner's hands I want to control my partner's posture so I switch to a collar tie like so and I switch to an inside bicep tie if my hands on the inside and I'm hell bent on getting a clamp I want to get to a clamp and I feel like my partner is going to move away and I feel like I can't pull my left arm out in time it's permissible for me to take a right hand collar tie initially if she's trying to pull away from me that means she's not trying to come forward and control my head so I don't need to have an inside bicep tie and as she goes to pull away I quickly go in right hand collar tie I switch left hand collar tie she tries to pull away she can't do it she tries to come towards me now which is the only other direction she can and control my head and I now have an inside bicep tie so if she's pulling away from me it's permissible to use a collar tie with either hand if she's coming in towards me what I don't want is for her to grab a strong collar tie she pulls me in now she starts to get that chest to chest contact once again okay you still have a side guard so it's not the end of the world but it can give you some problems and you can end up using more energy than you want to so if I feel like I have I start with my hand inside and underneath her jaw and she goes to pull away I can use a right hand collar tie I can make a switch to a left hand collar tie and I move to an inside bicep tie now when she goes to push towards me she can't when she goes to pull away from me it's difficult and now from here I just pull my left knee up I fire my right knee inside my partner's shoulder like so and now I just cast my leg over and I connect heel and knee together I place my hand over my own leg so when she goes to drive forwards she can't when she goes to pull away she can't when she goes to posture up she can't and from here it's a pretty easy thing to go into a variety of follow-up attacks and go into all of our winning transitions from there okay so moving from a side guard into a clamp and the reason why this works so well is because she will get overextended trying to keep her hands locked in the pin for as long as she can the hands are here then you extend they get to a point where she starts to get overextended and finally as they separate now her underhook becomes a liability we can throw a clamp into place and go into all of our attacks all right let's look at another great attack that we can go to after we re-guard from this side guard because of the fact that my partner is overextended with that underhook many times what will happen is your partner as you go to re-guard and move into this clamp position what your partner will do is as you try to take your knee to your partner's far shoulder your partner will posture up and she will push the knee across like so and then she will try to start coming around the corner getting control of your head and then using that to start moving her way back into some kind of pin whether it be side control or north-south so a lot of times you lose the head and your partner either tries to pull away from you or they try to come forward into you and retain the pin so as I see this happening I'm trying to go and I'm starting to try to control my partner's head and for whatever reason I start to move into this clamp position my partner clears the head maybe she ducks the head to the other side and from here she moves the head out and away okay but I can't have the situation where my partner quickly either one just pulls away and she moves away and now I've recovered guard which is what we're looking for but I have no follow-up attacks or she clears the head and then she quickly pulls the arm out she pops up to her feet and then she just runs around the corner pushes my knee away and then from here she goes in and passes me this is a very common scenario so the second I feel I'm losing my partner's head and she starts moving out of way I take my hand here my partner's elbow like so I just pull my partner's hand up into my armpit I by lifting my elbow and then reclamping my arm back down like so so from here I have my partner's thumb pointing at my armpit so she has her hand like so I reposition my partner's arm by lifting opening the elbow and now from here I just reclamp everything down like so when she goes to slip the head I take my knee to my partner's near shoulder and I take my foot to my partner's lat muscle what this does is it creates a scissoring effect where my knee pushes towards her into her shoulder my right knee as my left knee comes in towards my own body and now my whole thing from here is to move my head towards my partner's arm as I point my knees in the opposite direction and bring my hips forward when we get incredibly strong take it how my finishes and now from here when she goes to rip that arm out and go to pass me it's difficult when she tries to drive forwards into me she puts more pressure on the brake and we can get extremely strong finishes with taking time out our partner because of the overextension of that arm so we go for the initial recovery into from side guard we try to go into a clamping position I feel like for whatever reason I'm losing the head so from here we just initially open up our knee and we control our partner's elbow as I do that I gain some control over my partner's head even if she bats the head across I go in and I control my partner's head so when she goes to rip out it's a difficult thing from here now from here I reposition my partner's arm and now as she goes to start making a recovery I just take my foot up to my partner's lat muscle like so and I take my two knees together and I scissor my leg by pushing my right knee into my partner's shoulder and pulling my left knee up into my chest and now from here as my head moves towards my partner's arm my hips come forward and my knees point in the opposite direction like so okay so as I'm losing this clamping position she has to start pulling away I catch I move into a situation like so and now it doesn't look like much but this is an incredibly strong braking position where you can get extremely strong finishes with taking time out and go into brakes on her partner's arm as she goes to start either re-passing my guard to solidify a pin again or pulling out and away so a great way to re-guard and go right from a defensive cycle into an offensive cycle right back into attacks as soon as we get the inside position. All right so now let's look at moving from a failed take atame or a failed clamp or any kind of situation where a partner tries to aggressively rip the underhook out because it's getting exposed let's look at transitions from the upper body into the lower body okay this is something we talked about many times in the past whenever I see we're going for any kind of upper body transition whether it be moving into a clamping position moving into take atame and my partner's posturing up and the head and shoulders are moving away from me whenever I see the head and shoulders moving away you know that you know one thing for certain the lower body will be left behind the only way she can posture up and move away from me is by exposing the lower body and the second I see that we can go into exposure on my partner's lower body so as she goes to start posturing up and away we try to go for take atame or clamp whenever the case I see the head moving away the second I see the head moving away I just go in and I scoop into my partner's far leg like so and I invert my right knee so now from here when she goes to start coming towards me worst case scenario is I lose my she sprawls the leg back and from here I have knee and elbow connection I lock a side guard and my partner can no longer put any any heat on me anymore so the second I see I'm losing my partner's upper body we just go in and we scoop the far leg and we connect knee and elbow so now worst case scenario is my partner sprawls leg back she comes forward she gets to a top pin I still have side guard I can just reboot the system and go into our side guard escapes like we just did okay best case scenario is from here we come through and we take a cross a cross grip a cross V grip on our partner's elbow like so so that from here once you guys start taking a kala Thai on me it's a very difficult thing if I feel like for whatever reason I go in I try to take that cross V grip on my partner's elbow and I miss the elbow I just go right to the shoulder instead okay now what you guys to come forward so you can get control over my head but the cross shoulder post will give her limited control over my head but best of all is going in and taking a cross V grip right in the elbow so when she goes to access my head she has no access altogether and now from here we're going to take our leg and we're going to fire it over our partner's hip and connect to the back of our knee to our partner's hip let's repeat a little bit the back of our knee to our partner's hip like so now what our partner needs to crush us and to start sprawling is heel to butt connection if she can sit back so that her butt and her heels are relatively close together or touching it's gonna be hard to off balance your partner and expose the legs from here so the second I move into this position I just take a grip here my partner's heel when she gets to start sprawling I just open the heel in a circular motion towards my head so when she goes to start sprawling out in a way she can't if I try to lock my hands like most people do and pull and she sprawls you're gonna lose this battle here so instead I move in a circular fashion up towards my head so she goes to give a strong strong sprawl I separate the heel and the butt and now we switch from a scoop grip on the knee to a scoop grip on the ankle when she gives a sprawl now the heel so far away from the butt that you can go into any kind of follow-up you want whether it be going into a regular outside hashigurami whether it be firing into a backside 50-50 there are many different options from here the main thing is just getting into your partner's legs and going from upper body to lower body transition right off the recovery so I see from here we go in we go side guard we're going to make some kind of some kind of recovery she goes to posture up in a way we immediately come through we scoop the far leg and we invert the knee inside of our partner's legs now from here she goes to reach towards my head always best we go inside our partner's far elbow so she can't even make contact if I feel like for whatever reason I'm trying to do it I miss I just go right to the shoulder like so we take a cross shoulder post and now from here when she goes to start coming towards me if I feel like she has contact I just pull her in and I put her hands on the floor so she goes to start pulling herself in I just put her hands on the floor like so now from here she has no choice but to sit back if she doesn't sit back then I can start inverted completely underneath her and going into her legs so from here as she has to sit back and away from me I fire my leg over so if I see she has contact with me she's pulling herself in she's trying to sprawl I don't pull her and try to pull her hips right towards mine I'm looking to tilt her and pull her on top of me so I'm pushing pushing pushing as she goes to come towards me if she has contact I push push push I don't go in and lock my hands and try to separate my partner's heel and butt from here it's never going to work so instead I push push push she goes to push in and from here I pull her towards and on top of me I just tilt her across my body so as she goes to come in strong I put her hands on the floor she can't stay here now if she stays here I'm going to start putting her hands on the floor and then inverting into her legs in a much more deadly way so what she does is she'll always move back and away and posture up and as she does that my leg can come through now from here we grab the heel once you go start sprawling from this position I just rotate in a circular fashion from here we move up to a scoop grip on the ankle and now she has no heel to butt connection and it's a pretty easy thing to enter into my partner's legs in various ways whether we go with a standard ashi garami backside 50-50 or what have you from there you have entrances into your partner's legs and you have a way to go into a recovery from guard moving from side guard to some kind of upper body attack the upper body attack fails and we go right into the legs as we always do. Now let's talk about other ways we can escape where we can punch in a far side underhook so if we can get to a side guard you have a pretty clear path to victory you have a knee and elbow connection you keep the knee and elbow connection and then you can always separate your partner's hands from there so side guard is always going to be the best way to go into escapes and if you can connect your knee and elbow you're almost guaranteed to escape. Other ways that we can start going to escapes when our partner is crowding our shoulders is by punching a far side underhook and then going into either recoveries or attacks on your partner's legs or coming up and wrestling so let's take a look at some of those now. First we have to look at actually establishing a far side underhook. Alright so my partner has the top head arm in place and from here we look to get our hand to the inside position like so. We look to get our elbow to the inside position like so and now from here we're going to look to start bridging in towards our partner we have a feet grip in the shoulder with a cross shoulder post we're going to start bridging towards our partner and we're going to tuck our hand to our own chest. I bridge towards my partner like so and I just tuck my hand to my own chest and we move into a situation like this. Now once I'm in this position my whole thing is to slip my elbow inside my partner's shoulder so I'm going to create space with my left elbow and I'm just going to look to start moving my hips out and away from my partner and from this position as I move away I'm just going to turn and shoot my arm through and once I get to this position I put an underhook in place. Now my whole thing from here is to clear my partner's cross face. If she goes to flatten me out from here I start tightening the underhook up I just put additional pressure on the cross face. So the second I see this I immediately look away from my partner once again and I just connect my chin to my own shoulder and now I have that knee to hip connection I just bump my partner forward and I get our hands to the floor and I have my head now underneath my partner's chest and the cross face is cleared. So from here once again we start we get elbow inside we get hand inside. We look to start bridging and getting our hand to our chest. So right now you see that there's no space between my chest and my partner's chest so I'm going to punch my hand down as far as I can and it runs into our own bodies. So I create space and distance with an initial bridge and I just tuck my hand in as far as we can go then we come back down to this position like so. Now as my partner goes to keep me pinned I just walk away and from here I create space with my left elbow. From this position I just shoot my right elbow inside my partner's shoulder. I turn my shoulders into a situation where my right shoulder is almost directly on top of my left shoulder instead of parallel to the floor. So perpendicular to the floor instead of parallel to the floor. And now from here we just bump our partner forward with the intention of clearing the cross face and getting hands to the floor. And now from here we can go into a variety of re-recoveries, a variety of attacks and we'll look at those in one second. One more time real quick we have our partner with a strong top-headed arm. From this position we want to start getting everything to the inside position and we're going to start bridging and getting our partner off balance. As we do this we take our hand to the inside position and now as we come back down we just start walking away from our partner and get to a situation like so. My whole thing from here is to create an angle on our partner where my two shoulders are perpendicular to the floor. If I try, even if I have my hand inside like so, if I try to shoot my shoulder or my elbow inside like this it's never going to work. So my whole thing is if I come back down to this position I turn an angle away and from here my elbow slips inside. Now she has to bring everything in tight and I just bump my partner forward and I take her hands out to the floor. And now from here we can go into recoveries, we can go into attacks and we'll look at how we're going to move shortly. Okay, by just bridging, getting an initial kizushi, getting a hand to the chest and creating an angle where we turn the shoulders towards our partner, slip the elbow inside and then we can put an underhook in place and start to go in and go to work. All right, so let's look at our most basic and conservative pathway here to get back into just a regular open guard without going into any counter offense. So we punch this underhook in and my opponent's recourse will always be to start sitting back onto their heels, covering my hips and trying to get some kind of control over my head once again. All right, so whenever I get to this underhook, I'm in a situation like so, she has her hands locked and I bump my partner forward. If my partner keeps moving up towards my shoulders there's no reason why I can't just come up and start taking my partner's back and chasing the legs and doing any of that. So the second I get to this underhook my partner is immediately going to look to start putting a V-grip into my armpit, sitting back towards her heels and then getting into a situation where she can cross face me, cross face me and now flatten me out and look to start punching in inside bicep ties, going back to underhooks and flattening me back out. So the second I see I bump my partner and we move into a situation like so, I know from here that my partner's going to take a V-grip and put it inside my armpit, okay? And this is a very conservative way that we can regard, it's also a way that we can regard if we feel like we can't access our partner's legs. Like for example, if we try to go to a tight waist or we try to go to our partner's leg and the leg is sprawling back and away from us and I feel like I can't access my partner's legs, we just bring the hands back inside and we bring knees to elbows. So I'm trying to use the underhook effectively, my partner starts sitting back and chasing my hips and putting a V-grip in my armpit like so. The second I see this, we just take our left hand and we catch an inside bicep tie like so, and we take our underhook and we move it across to a cross shoulder pose here. So now when she has to come forward once again and re-control my head, she can't. She can't get chest to chest and she can't control my head. And now it's the easiest thing in the world, wherever she goes, to just form that side guard with my knee and elbow like so, and now the easiest thing to insert my right knee, now we have the full inside position and we're ready to go in and go into a very basic recovery. So she comes around the other side this time, we come in, we get to this underhook and we bump our partner forward like so. The second I see this, she goes to put a V-grip in, what I can't have is for her to put her chin over my elbow and a cross face to come back into place. So the second we move into this position, we just take our hand up like so, with a backhand frame. Now she goes to put the cross face in, we convert to an inside bicep tie. From here I just pommel my hand inside, we go to a cross shoulder post like so. Now once she goes to come forward into me, it's the easiest thing to connect my knee and my elbow, form a side guard and put my knee back to the inside position or move into any of the previous attacks with a clamp, take a Tame, moving into my partner's legs and going into those offensive cycles. But whenever I see number one, I have an underhook, I want to just very conservatively re-guard, it's my only objective is to put my opponent back in some kind of open guard. Or I feel like I'm trying to go to a tight waist, trying to go to my partner's legs and they're just not available, she's doing a good job of chasing my hips, shutting down my underhook with a V-grip in good head position, I just take everything back to the inside position. So I start by going into an underhook, threatening going into my partner's legs, maybe I threaten going into the legs, she sprawls, I take an inside bicep tie, I go from an underhook to a cross shoulder post and then you deny your partner control of your head, you deny your partner the ability to come forward and get chest to chest and then everything can gradually come to the inside and you have all of your limbs inside and can go into at least a re-guard and then counterattacks. All right, so now let's look at using this underhook to move into offense in the upper body by inserting butterfly hooks and forward shifting into shoulder crunch sumigeshi or pinch headlock variations. So this time we're going to look at someone who's in side control and we manage to get this underhook like so. From this scenario we're going to look to bump our partner forward once again. So we take our partner forward, we put hands on the floor. From this position we're going to take a high underhook where we just go in, we grab across on our partner's far trap like so. So now this way when our partner goes to take that right hand of hers and put a V-grip in my armpit, I can always, as she's going to do that, I can flare my left elbow up high so when she goes to actually make that V-grip I can always put her hand back on the floor. Now from this position I'm going to scoot away and I'm just going to go in and connect my knee and my elbow and I'm going to form a side guard initially like so. So now I have the ability to stop my partner from putting pressure on me through the side guard and I also have the ability to some degree to keep her hands on the floor above my shoulders. So when she has to sit back to her heels and use her hands offensively on me, I can use the flaring of this left elbow to keep her hands on the floor long enough to go into my attacks. From here we're going to go in and we're going to start to push on our own foot and extend our partner's near leg out and away from us. So now when the time is right we can take our butterfly hook and insert it inside our partner's thigh like so. Now we go in and we use one of two grips. We either go in and lock a pinch headlock on our partner where we control the head and the arm or if you want to I can move right to a shoulder crunch grip like so. Generally I recommend until you get two butterfly hooks I go in and I lock a pinch headlock grip because it gives you more control of your partner's upper body when you have less control of the lower body. So in general what I'll do is I'll play a game where I have a pinch headlock in place and as she goes to squirm around and free the head and the arm I insert a second butterfly hook and now once I have the second butterfly hook in place now I can forward shift and if you want to make a transition into shoulder crunch and now you can play your shoulder crunch game where you go into all of your offense. So we come in and we initially get to this underhook we put our partner's hands out on the floor like so. Now we move from this tight waist into a true high underhook position and as my partner goes to start taking her V grip in place I just flare the elbow long enough to come in and connect my knee and elbow together. From here we immediately go in and we start locking our hands. As we go to lock our hands we look to make space for that butterfly hook to come through and we go and we lock a pinch headlock. As we have control of our partner's upper body we just slide our left butterfly hook in and now we have connection at the lower and the upper body. When she goes to squirm from here we make space to insert our second butterfly hook and now we have the choice of using either pinch headlock or shoulder crunch attacks to go in and get the win. So from the opposite side she's over on this side this time we get to this underhook scenario we put our partner's hands on the floor. From here we switch to a nice high underhook going to our partner's far shoulder. From here we have frames inside and we use that to connect our knee and our elbow like so. Now from here we start to make space and elongate our partner's body. Now we can come in and we can lock our hands in a pinch headlock. As we lock up we insert a butterfly hook. When she goes to move from here and free the elbow free the head it's a difficult thing because I'm stretching my partner's body out. Now as she goes to move around we insert our second butterfly hook and now we have a choice of playing with pinch headlock or with shoulder crunch where we can go in and start to play our either positional or submission game from there. So we use an underhook this time instead of just conservatively reguarding we use an underhook to keep our partner's hands on the floor long enough to lock a side guard extend the body insert a butterfly hook and then move into offensive shoulder crunch to migeishi's pinch headlocks and things of that of that nature. All right so this time we're going to work on moving from an underhook initially from side control and moving into a situation where we can move into half guard and specifically a half guard with a lower leg shift. So let's take a look at this. So she's going to be on this side this time and we're going to have this underhook we initially punch an underhook in and we get into a situation where we can move to a tight waist. Okay now we're distinguishing between a tight waist here and an underhook here. For this particular one I'm going to look to stay on a tight waist so I have control over over my partner's hips and her ability to move away from me with the hips. Now I'm looking to go into half guard if I can just step over and catch my partner's leg between mine that's always permissible. More than likely your partner's gonna have shoelaces on the floor she's gonna be sitting back towards her heels and it's gonna be hard to actually go in and get a bite on your partner's uh on your partner's ankle. So from here I'm going to use a combination of the tight waist and a combination of my top leg to bump my partner forward onto her hands and I'm going to quickly move down to a situation where I can pick my partner's ankle on the inside of the ankle like so. So now when she goes to sprawl she can't sprawl out and away from me. In order for her to effectively sprawl she has to turn towards me so that we're perpendicular and then sprawl back and away. So I just take the outside of her ankle and I just connect it to my legs. So now when she goes to sprawl there's no sprawl available and now from here I can quickly flare my partner's ankle I can reach over and I can trap the ankle between my uh my two legs. Once I have the ankle trapped I go in and I move back to a tight waist. Now as she goes to start sprawling and putting weight on me it's a pretty easy thing to go in and scoop my partner's far leg. And now we can play a game we looked at in the half guard series where you play a game between tilting our partner over if she keeps the whizzer in if she takes the whizzer out then we start to tilt her over and then we go right to our partner's lat we come up and now we move into a situation where I can go and start taking my partner's back okay and not gonna go into too much detail there because it's a different instructional but just understand that this is the game that we can play. So we get our partner's hands to the floor like so. The second I get the hands to the floor with everything inside we just move down to our partner's ankle. Now from this scenario we just pull our partner's ankle towards our legs when she goes to sprawl it's a difficult thing and then we just catch our partner's ankle between our two knees. We move back to a situation where we go into a tight waist we go to a scoop grip on the far leg and now we play a game from a lower leg shift position. Conversely if you don't want to do this and you just want to get to half guard and you want to move back to a half guard there's no reason why you would want to move back to a half guard because you're in a much better position with a lower leg shift maybe your partner's greased for example and you can't hold on to the ankle which is a good reason why you would want to just go back into a half guard. I move to this lower leg shift position I move to a tight waist like so. If I want to just force her back into a half guard instead of going to a scoop grip on the far leg I just take my elbow inside my partner's knee and now from here I scissor my legs in the opposite direction as I would for the lower leg shift. I just put my partner back into a full half guard. Right now from here we can play a game from half guard we can go into a shoulder crunch into pinch headlocks or whatever you want to do. Over to a full butterfly guard or a closed guard whatever your favorite options are from there. Okay so using this under hook initially gaining an under hook moving to a lower leg shift on our partner's ankle and then using that to go into attacks from half guard attacks on our partner's back anything you want from there. All right but escaping from side control moving to an initial under hook slash tight waist and then going into some half guard variations and counter attacks right after you go into the initial escape. This time we punch in that far side under hook off the side control initial escape and now we're going to look to go into our partner's legs. This time instead of going in and getting to our partner's ankle and trapping it between our two legs I'm just going to catch my partner's ankle and I'm going to take my ankle inside my partner's like so and from this position I'm going to take my knee behind my partner's butt and I'm just going to bump my partner forward onto her hands and now I'm going to play a game where I start to sit up to my elbow. As I sit to my elbow my partner's reaction will always be to try to return me to my back by pushing into me. As she goes to push into me I just take my head and I rotate towards my partner's far heel and I just slide right underneath my partner's center of gravity so as she goes to push into me I take a knee and elbow together like so but you can't just step over into mount obviously I have knee and elbow connection and I just shoot my leg through and I connect my partner's heel to my hip and we put a knee inside and we go right into arimi ashi garami and I'm ready to go on the attack. So from here I get to this underhook I put my partner's hands on the floor and I get my head underneath my partner's chest. From this position we come in and we just glue our partner's foot to our legs. From here I take my knee up to my partner's butt and I use a combination of a shuck with my right elbow where I bump my partner forward and my knee to just push my partner forward slightly to her hands. As I do this I just tuck my elbow in I just sit up to an elbow like so. There will be times where you try to build to an elbow whether it be by taking your elbow behind you and coming up or whether by opening up the elbow and coming up where you can't quite get all the way up and your partner goes to push you down. I don't have to come all the way up to this power prop I just have to threaten sitting up into my partner to get a push back reaction and from here I have my foot on the inside of the ankle. As she goes to push back into me I just pull the foot to the outside of my hip I connect my knee and my elbow on the opposite side and I pull her into arimi ashi garami. So we get control this ankle like so and we put a foot on the inside. From here I bump my partner forward like so and now I either tuck my elbow inside my partner's knee and inside my hip like so and I build up to an elbow or from here as I bump her forward I come up and I build to an elbow. Now from here she's going to try to return me to the floor. The purpose of me building up to an elbow is so I get the push back reaction. If I try from here to pull my partner on top of me and she sags back and away from me it's going to be hard to pull her into ashi garami from here. So from here I build up to an elbow or I make believe I'm going to build up to an elbow. So now if my partner goes to sag back and away from me she really switches top position. So I make her believe that I'm coming up on top of her and now she gets to drive back into me and as that happens it's an easy thing to get in and insert legs pulling her into arimi ashi garami and getting into an offensive cycle for the win. So the whole thing is to create some kind of push back reaction where I have a foot on the inside. I just take my ankle to my partner's ankle. Now from here as I come forward I bump her hands forward and start racing towards my partner. If I try to just pull her on top of me and she sits back and away it's hard to pull that leg through. And even if I do pull the leg through from here I don't have a strong connection. She backs away, she pulls the leg out and as we both get up I lose bottom position. I play a game where I race forward towards her like so. As she has to push back towards me we pull ourselves into arimi ashi garami and we can back into our offensive cycle and start all our attacking sequences. Now let's look at coming up into my partner once I get to this initial underhook. So I bump my partner forward, get the hands to the floor and then we immediately come up. So this time we're going to be in a scenario where we get to this underhook, we move to a tight waist to an underhook and we're going to start coming up into our partner. Now understand that as you go to come up your partner is always going to be putting a whizzer on you. I can bump my partner forward and I can get the hands to the floor and if I'm trying to go into half guard things like that I'll be able to put the hands on the floor for some amount of time but eventually she's going to either v-grip inside my armpit or she's going to put a whizzer on me. So from these exchanges if I'm looking to come up towards my partner what I have to do is I have to take as much heat off of the whizzer as possible. If I try to come up from this position where I have a tight waist in place and I try to come up I feel all the weight of the whizzer and it's very labored when I try to come up into my partner. So from here I'm going to try to come up I stay below my partner's buttocks here so that as I come up I grab my partner's inside ankle but she goes to sprawl it's difficult. And now from here I bump my partner forward I scissor my legs and I just tuck my elbow inside my own hip like so. Now as I come up she puts the whizzer back on but now as she goes to apply the whizzer because I'm below the buttocks and not on a tight waist there's almost no pressure on the whizzer and it's the easiest thing in the world as she goes to apply it for me to get up and now I'm up into this underhook versus whizzer scenario. Now I don't move back to my partner's back to a tight waist right away because now she can go in and she can put a whizzer on and I feel a good amount of pressure still. So I stay on my partner's ankle from here and from this position there's many ways that we can go. We can start coming up we can move to a thigh pry we can joust our knee in front we can go to body locks we can go to pinch headlocks we can play a game where we put a leg between our legs and then from here as we go to the tight waist and a thigh pry we can shove a leg inside like so and split our partner's legs so now when she goes to apply the whizzer she has no ability to drive forward. There's tons of different things that we can do from here and spend hours here working from here but the main thing is just moving into a wrestling exchange with my partner off of this initial underhook from side control. So she's a top head and arm I punch an underhook in and I start going in and bumping my partner forward. From here I immediately look to start tucking my elbow and I go to the ankle. Now as I go to start coming up I shove my partner forward I keep the hands on the floor as long as I can but eventually as I go to scissor my legs she puts a whizzer on. If I stay in a tight waist and I come up she's going to whizzer me back down to the floor. I stay below my partner's buttocks so now as we both go to get up or she goes to whizzer me down and I go to get up I can easily get up and now because I'm below the buttocks there's no whizzer pressure and it's a pretty easy thing now for me to start working and going in building height and moving however I'm going to move from this position. So I bump my partner forward instead of conservatively re-guarding instead of walking into half guard instead of going into ashigurami this time we actually come all the way up and we start working from underhook versus whizzer scenario.
