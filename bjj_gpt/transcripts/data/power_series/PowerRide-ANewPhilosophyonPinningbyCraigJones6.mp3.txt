 Now, let's get to the most important part and that is the section where we cover about how these pins ultimately lead to submissions. Obviously, a lot of people watch this series now think prior to this point, they'll be like, oh, that's great. You're controlling your training partners, you're pinning them. But how do we create submission opportunities from these positions? And these positions are unorthodox to most people. So we need to start covering details about how we can get submissions from here. And really some of the most powerful ones we're going to have are triangle. But number one in the hierarchy will be a re-naked while we've flattened our training partners out. So again, let me teach this, it's going to look brutal behind the cameras, but you only need to apply as much pressure as necessary. Flattening people out immediately turns people off because they think, oh, you're breaking this guy's spine. And obviously you could do that, but you could do that in any position. You take a body triangle, you don't need to squeeze a body triangle as hard as you can. Anything, you take a DAS, someone that's terrible at a DAS joke, literally just squeezes a guy's neck, typically speaking, the guy taps the neck pressure as well as a strangle, right? So the key here is to use the correct pressure necessary. So we'll be doing submissions such as arm triangle, flattening out to create a re-naked pressure. We're going to be covering some possible entries to a Kimura. There's a submission called a cow catcher that acts both as a pin and a submission in and of itself. Another one that will look brutal, it's going to look like a lot of neck pressure, but for the most part, it'll be some form of compression submission. We will have paths to DAS and front head style attacks too. I'm not going to go into great detail about how to finish every submission or possible follow-ups to each submission. We're going to keep it short and simple because the most important part about this product is you using unorthodox controls to pin your opponents and put them in uncomfortable positions. That's the greatest strength we can draw from this. That's dominating your opponent. And then as you dominate your opponent, these submission opportunities will present themselves. And these submission opportunities will all include one thing, and that is that we remain on top to finish them. We'll treat the bottom player as if they're a very high risk, very hard to control person and we want to stay on top at all costs. So we're very conservative in that sense, but you'll find the submission opportunities that are open to you are very high percentage. Some of the positions feel so uncomfortable, not the right word, but they feel like you don't have any opportunity to escape. So you basically want to be submitted in some of these positions. Tyler is going to feel every ounce of pressure I can apply, but I'm showing you this out of the goodness of my own heart so we can make Tyler suffer. You can see what's possible so you don't have to do that to your training partners. All right, so let's talk about our control positions that lead to submission. I've got two elderly men with me because some of these will be uncomfortable and two spines broken is better than one in my opinion, right? So when we talk about arm triangles, Tyler's on his back here. The traditional arm triangle is obviously going to be set up from a position like now where we start to get the elbow high and we're starting to come the arm across and you see where his arms end up is basically on this trajectory here. And the ideal arm triangle is obviously if we can bring his arm in such a way that it's going to block off the carotid arteries on this side, right? But that's very difficult to do. The second one here, Tyler wants to keep his arm back at all costs, right? So that's why in my opinion, some of the best arm triangle setups are set up off of a failing bridge here. So Tyler goes to bridge into it and I use that opportunity to track his arm in the perfect position prior to us starting to hop off to the side and finish the submission, right? So when they try to reach this arm across to create a bridge, it allows us to capture the perfect position here. That's because this shoulder is off the ground. If we set it up out of a mounted position, generally speaking, their arm will be trapped here and then we have the battle to get it here and often sometimes they'll answer the phone like so. So obviously the way we're pinning people here is basically artificially creating that bridging pressure here. If I am pinning Tyler's knee on this side, it's not in his spine's best interest to keep this shoulder on the ground on this side, right? So it allows us to generate that trajectory of the bicep against the throat to make it perfect. So if we have Tyler's head facing the camera, let's just look at it out of one example of our basic leg staple here. So you can see here, it's so easy for me to take perfect grips here. It's very difficult for Tyler to be doing this sort of motion because if he keeps his arm here, there's a baby seal in here. So you can see that it's actually in his interest to keep his arm cross body down here. I'm going to have to put it out to get it to stop laughing. So obviously we want to sit up and I'm trying to, we're creating that artificial bridge mechanism here, right? But what we also don't want to do is rush this position. So obviously we're trying to feed this arm as deep as possible here, but the second I get it, I don't want to jump off because Tyler might hit a backwards row and he might start to stretch our arms out and we lose the depth. Even a failed backwards row can cause my arm to shorten here and that can be a problem for us finishing a clean arm triangle. So if Tyler's here, we want to keep his legs in this configuration for as long as possible and we also want to keep weight on Tyler for as long as possible. I'm going to have to really put it to sleep. So if we set up our arm triangle, we want to keep him on this trajectory, right? So we secure our grips nice and tight. The arm around the head is going to go palm down. The reason we do that is because we have this gap in the bicep when our palm's up. When it goes palm down, this gap is taken away. So we've got our arm triangle set up. The hand around the head is going to go palm down to secure our grips. You see I'm keeping weight on Tyler as long as I can. My head's looking to wrap and me to place my chin onto his nose here. So if Tyler's trying to flare his arm out and my head's next to him here, he can bring this arm up. If I guide my chin towards his nose, it drags his arm into the correct position here. And then for us to finish, I'm keeping my right elbow on the ground and I circle. And with each circle, I apply pressure in such a way that it completes the arm triangle here. So again, we're setting it up from our position here, which is helping us create the artificial bridge. So we can even have a pit stop with the claw to pull his head closer. It's a frame on the back to start getting this arm deep. We get everything in position, the arm around the head, palm down, gable grip. I start applying pressure to Tyler here. You can see we can even sometimes finish where we don't even take weight off. But if you pay attention to my right leg, I'm keeping it on him as long as possible. So if Tyler's trying to hit a backwards roll, we're still on him here. We feel that first explosion and then we get the finish. We try it on a bigger body here. We replace the seal. So when he's trapped on this side and my brother has the spinal flexibility of a 77 year old man, you'll see a much stronger and how much easier it is for me to secure this arm deep. So we secure a deep grip. And again, we can even use that claw to pull his head closer to us to start feeding this in. We've got our grips tight and I'm guiding my head over his head, trying to wrap and keep weight on him as long as possible here. And we start to generate that pressure to create the tap, but we're not jumping off because he could hit a backwards roll here. And even if he doesn't get it, he comes back, he's created a bit more space in my arms where you can start to bring this arm up. And that makes it harder for us to finish. So we're keeping the legs split. I'm bringing everything in nice and tight. He's still trapped on that outside and we're starting to set this up. And you can see we got the submission before coming off, but obviously here, if he tries to backwards roll, my knees still on top and we can start to get that submission pressure. Palm down, minimize the space. I'm trying to bring my chin on top as this shoulder collapses to the ground. And depending on the size of your bicep, we need to keep that active at all times. So again, space, no space. That's how we're going to complete the arm track. So we got my brother and the Canadian seal. All right, so we covered the arm triangle. Sometimes when we're trying to strangle a baby. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh man, don't mention baby seal. Oh man. Oh my God, I'm dying. We had to send Tyler back to his seal colony, so we've gathered. Okay. What the heck? We have one rule, bro. We have one rule. All right, we're good. All right, so we're going to talk about failed arm triangles. No matter how well we set it up, you can see in the previous scene, I was ensuring to turn his body away from the arm triangle as long as possible. And then I was trying to keep my weight on top of them as long as possible. So they can't generate momentum with a backwards roll. We'll do some crazy shit like grab their own legs because if we're using an arm triangle, I really need this shoulder to the floor here. So if his arms are crossed, we're applying this pressure to get the strangle. If they start to lift the shoulder off the ground here, there's really no clean way to get the arm triangle here. I mean, you might be squeezing their necks, but the arm triangle pressure is generated down here and that's what this shoulder collapsed to the ground. If they hit a hard bridge away from us here, we're going to shallow out our arm, right? Arm triangle, I'm taking my hand as deep as possible. If we lose it and they bridge away, I shallow it out. So if you stay still here, my hand and shoulder are now in line with his shoulders here, right? So again, arm triangle is as deep as we can go. When they turn onto their side, we're looking to take this position here, right? So if I'm setting up an arm triangle and they bridge away, I'm going to start using an arm in Ezekiel choke here, right? So we're going to grab our bicep and our secondary arm is going to act in line with the spine. So it's in line with the spine. There is none of this slicing into the neck pressure. All my secondary arm is doing is staying in line with the spine. It helps us collapse their head here, right? Obviously if my arm is too deep here, all I can do is try to push into their spine. But as they turn away, as they turn away and we shallow it out, we can grab our bicep and my forearm is in line with the spine. My left hand, that secondary hand pushes and my strangle arm starts to retract and we get the tap here. So we can finish on top quite easily here. So I'm pushing his head into the choke while that forearm is in line with his shoulders. My right arm retracts. So it's not a squeeze. I'm not squeezing everywhere as hard as I can. It's going to hurt his neck. I push and retract. And if we really want to make it tight, we can start to do that chair sit motion. I don't mind setting up the chair sit too much from here because as you can see, the submission is kind of dead to rights here. So I fall to my thigh here and we get that submission. So again, how this might look in the complete context is we're here. I've started to flatten them out and that shoulder powers back off the ground. So I shallow my arm out almost as if I'm in the claw range. I grab my own bicep here. I place that arm and forearm blade behind their head. I start pushing their head and retracting our strangle hand. Push, retract. Not this. We're pushing and retracting. Don't just squeeze the neck. So we're trying to create that sort of frame behind the head that bends the head and we can take this chair sit motion to have a little extra force because when I'm pulling them onto my right hip, it allows me to push the back of the head a lot better. So then again, don't squeeze as hard as you can at the get go. Start to apply consistent pressure over time. That's going to ultimately lead to that strangle pressure that you can maintain. Common mistakes people make trying at really any submission, any strangle, but specifically arm in strangles is that they just squeeze as hard as they can from the get go, burn their arms out. We need to apply a pressure that we can hold at least 20 seconds and that's going to be a slow building pressure. Once you've created the wedge, once everything's tight and locked, apply consistently growing pressure over time that we can maintain and that's how we can use a failed arm triangle to set up an arm in Ezekiel. All right, so let's talk about the strongest thing we can do out of these positions, which would be belly down rear naked. We're going to cover how we could do it from our leg rides using the Khabib grip, the Dagestani handcuff and also how we can set it up when our training partner, our opponent's in turtle position and we want to sort of encourage him to fall back onto a hip while we're using that diagonal ride style position. So how it comes up, again, if I have effective hands here, so I've got Tyler's leg split and I'm applying this chest pressure into Tyler. I can even start to use my cross-facing arm to pull his head in line with his hips and his lower leg and you can see that's already starting to encourage belly down movement. Quite often when people are stuck in this position here and they want to create movement, one of the ways we create movement is to just build height in any way we can. So obviously if I'm on top of Tyler here, I'm pressuring into him and he wants to start creating some sort of movement he feels in control of, he starts building up to that arm and that's where I'm initially going to take a same side control and then I'm going to reinforce it with the secondary control. Again, we keep these grips tight. I don't commit one arm to it because he can repummel behind his back here. So I want to trap it under his body first and I trap it under his body by pulling and using chest forward pressure. So we've got it controlled under his body now. It's going to be tough for him to clear this grip and now we start thinking about creating a rear naked style control here. I want to come under the neck, I don't want to use the claw grip here because the claw grip is a great control but it's going to be a little tougher for me to force him belly down from here because he can retract his elbow and I have to fight against it. So I want to come under the chin here. Obviously under the chin if he's keeping it tucked, from these positions, very easy to lift the chin. So I can start to lift there and come under. You can see Tyler tries to hand fight or anything here. There's really not a lot he can do with that. So I'm starting to lift and bridge my hips forward and I'm trying to replace my inside cramp hook to a single hook and that allows me to really force him belly down here. And the beauty of these setups is his hand fight is limited because his hand is preoccupied by the ground. That gives him some sort of comfort and control here. He went for a hand fight here, now his chest is taking his body weight. If you place the hand on the ground, he's not feeling as much pressure in the chest. So just to test, if he puts his hand on the ground and he starts to talk, still pretty bad but the hands off the ground, you can see now his chest is carrying all the weight. So we're really emphasizing lifting. We can finish with one hand which would be like that Garot style choke. So I'm retracting the elbow. If I'm confident he's belly down and he can't turn back into me, then we can start committing to the rear naked here. But really, we don't want to preemptively go for the rear naked because if Tyler starts turning back into me, yeah you can see it's hard for me to finish the shrangle. One way we can sort of mitigate that risk is by lifting his head. So Tyler tries to turn back in. Don't make it difficult, obviously it looks very uncomfortable but Tyler, if he brings his body this way, his upper body this way, you see now it's easier for him to start turning belly down. So one of the keys here is to keep pulling away. So we're pulling it towards the rear naked secondary grip, not allowing here. If I look up a strangle here, Tyler will turn his right shoulder back to the ground and we'll lose it, right? So if we have Tyler here and we want him to stay belly down, now he tries to turn his right shoulder, you see my chest is blocking his left shoulder. Here his left shoulder can come back through. It's hard for me to compress that. So we pull his body this way to start locking up rear naked. I want to get a quiet Tyler tries to move to relieve pressure. I've got hip pressure, chest pressure, you can see the legs are split. And again, if you combine that with the Dagestani style grip, I can use both to pull him belly down. Now Tyler's trying to fight from here. You see he doesn't even want to take his right hand off the ground and we can start locking up rear naked. So again, and yeah, obviously we can do this from all of our positions here. So if we have this leg right here, leg shelf and Tyler starts trying to come up to an elbow here, we control the wrist, we collapse their weight down. We flare our elbow to create belly down pressure here. I can open my legs here because we've got complete control ensuring that my right hook comes in if this leg comes across. So Tyler's trying to fight this here. Very, very difficult for him to fight this style of pressure. Now we can start to stretch him out again. Same principles here. If I want to commit to the rear naked, pull his head away from the rear naked grip. If he's allowed to pull his head towards it, bad time to die. Simply bring his head away and start locking up these rear naked grips. So just play around with it. Remember this head is a tool. If he wants to return to the flat of his back, he wants to crunch into a ball. So obviously to counter that, if we use his head to extend it away from his spine, and again, this obviously sounds uncomfortable, but Tyler can tap at any point. He can concede the submission at any point. It is still technical. We technically rode the legs. We technically secured the second hand. We secured our grips when we forced him belly down. Another situation would be he's in turtle here and we have our diagonal right. So with our inside hook, we've crossed our feet. I've pinched my knees together and I've started securing our grips here. So obviously he's up on a hand here, we can start to lift it and then secure it. And if I want to bring him back to his left hip, I hip in and I flare my right knee. And now we've collapsed him to his left hip. So now Tyler, he really cannot actually effectively come back up the turtle at this point. He's carrying so much weight in his hip. So we come back and step. So we've got our diagonal control here. I'm lifting the elbow if he's on his hand and we secure it. And then we flare our right knee and we create that hipping in pressure. And this is the ultimate scenario here. We've created this diagonal ride pressure where this wrist ride prevents him turning back into me. And the pressure I have on his hips here prevents him returning. His legs are split. We've contorted the spine. His secondary hand is preoccupied with keeping weight off of him and off of the ground. And we can come and punch through. And again, you'll find it much easier. A lot of people talk about using the knuckles to turn the head to expose the chin, but like from the back, that's much more difficult than from here. He keeps his chin tucked. Look how much easier it is from these positions. We could just do this all day, right? But again, very easy from here. I'm starting to bring his head in line with his lower hip and that's going to make him want to belly out here. But again, we have our Garotte style strangles or we can commit to a rear naked. And here, Tyler tries to turn back in. Very difficult because of the way I position my legs over the hip here. Come back. Let's do this way as well. So pay close attention to how I flare my right knee. So Tyler's trying to keep his balance and I flare everything. And we collapse him down to here. And this is one of the best positions for control here. Legs are split, weight on the legs, hands preoccupied. We got the wrist right. And again, here no matter what he tries to do to hide the strangle, it's going to be very, very easy. Even one hand here, we get a tap. We want him to go belly down, pull his head away and we can start setting up the strangle. But I'm applying, heaping in pressure. My hips are coming in and the leg that we're hooking, that outside knee is flaring. And what that does is if Tyler was in turtle here, we've eliminated this base. I'm pulling this hand in. So he's already tipping towards his shoulder. And then with the diagonal right pressure, I'm lifting this knee off the ground. So his only choice is but to collapse into this position. Arms stuck, hands posted on the floor, all our weight is here. So one more time. So pay close attention. So we kill his diagonal hand here. Weight is distributed towards his left shoulder. I cross my feet. He's trying to keep his right knee on the ground for stability. And you see he has to collapse it. We can start setting up our strangles here. So again, two clear different ways to approach it here. If he turtles, I think we have to emphasize flattening them out from here, especially against opponents that try to stand. We need some way to punish the guy from turtle that wants to use a four point to escape or return to his feet. Best way to do that is to start applying flattening out pressure, a pressure that encourages them to return to guard. But of course, they're not being returned to guard in a safe way. They're being returned to guard in such a way that we really truly do flatten them out, can finish the strangle. We can set it up with wrist rides from top turtle and from top leg rides. Let's cover two DAS setups that are very high percentage, very low risk. There'll be a couple of things I add to the DAS setup. Typically, the standard way people approach DAS is they look to establish control of the DAS itself and then they try to control the legs. So that would be the standard order. We get the front head submission, then we trap the leg to secure a strong finish that they can't move around out of. Another concept I'll use for DAS is the idea of fatiguing the neck. And this is one reason I think even the Rotolo brothers are so effective with DAS. If you watch the Rotolo brothers wrestle heavy on the collar ties, and what do collar ties do? When you resist them, it's going to start to fatigue the neck. And some of the people that are most resistant to DAS strokes have an insanely strong ability to flex their neck out of situations to find space to breathe. So when the Rotolos hit heavy collar ties all the time and start to fatigue their opponent's neck, by the time they secure the DAS, they're dealing with a fatigued neck. That one part of the body is already fatigued. Obviously, they have excellent technique, but I think that is also a contributing factor to the success rate they have with the DASes. So we can do similar things. So if I have Tyler in a side smash here, right? So we split the legs here, and Tyler's shelled up. What I'll often do is start to reach over the head, and I'll start to use my elbow to collapse Tyler's head. And what does Tyler want to do? He wants to start resisting that, right? It's an instinctual response. I'm limiting his movement capabilities here. We're curling him up into a little ball, and Tyler will resist. And sometimes he'll even be so frustrated, this top hand might just gently try to reach my elbow here to start pushing out. And you can see, what is that going to open up? It's going to open up space to slide the DAS here. So when I say we establish control over the top leg, I have control over the top leg. Your standard DAS setup will be, we've secured the grips, then we step over, and we track that leg, right? So we secure the DAS, and then we start to secure the top leg. If you can come back and visualize where we just were, we've stapled the legs, we've controlled the top leg, and I'm starting to bend Tyler's head. He's starting to want to resist this pressure. And really, you'd be surprised how easy it is to fatigue. If you see guys wrestling, see jujitsu guys get hit with five, six color ties, they already started to breathe heavy, all right? So you'd be surprised at how little effort I have to put into this. And then when Tyler is getting sick of it, he wants to start using his secondary hand. That leaves us space to start throwing our arm in. So you can see, the head's collapsed, and we don't have to break. I'm not reaching through to secure it, trying to throw this over. My elbow secured it, and we just do a pass off to start applying this pressure here. And I've locked up this hand. The strangle hand is as deep as it can go. Then the secondary hand comes as deep as it can go. But the secondary arm doesn't come so deep. It jeopardizes pressure. This is the Thai wedge. This hand is of secondary importance. I don't want this one to climb so high that my hand shallows out. We want to keep this pressure here for a good lock. When we start to get down to our fingers here, that's in situations where we slip, or they can apply pressure to the elbow, and we lose it. So I'm collapsing Tyler's head. He starts wanting to reach with that hand. Gives me space to feed this through, and I retract with my elbow here. We do that pass off. We reach as deep as we can, and we secure that top arm. Now I start to apply a bit of weight into him to lift this knee off the ground, because we want to secure this. Then we'll face this way here. So we split the legs here. We've locked up our darts. Everything's nice and quiet here. I put a bit of weight into him to allow me to place my feet underneath it. And we've got our darts set up. And what we want to start to do is think about bending the neck to create pressure here. I'm not trying to squeeze from all angles as much as possible here. I'm using my chest to bend him. So we're locked up, and our chest is coming in with a slight rotation. And this leg being shelved here really mitigates a lot of his explosive escaping capabilities. Most of the time, if we secure it well, if we don't have this leg, they can start using obviously their feet on the ground, generating pressure to weaken our grips here. So again, we're going to have a slight split. I'm fatiguing his neck until he starts to make a mistake. And we're going to open it here to get out handy. When you go across, everything's nice and quiet. I lean into him to secure the leg. I cross my feet. Tyler's trying to pull that leg out. Very, very difficult here. And then we can start to lock up our darts. And again, I'm trying to rotate so his head gets strangled in the darts. And we get that nice, gentle strangle here. So we're collapsing the head, and we're feeding this hand through to create a pass off. I hook the feet, and I create rotational pressure to secure the finish. So two things I think I do different. Fatigue the neck before we secure the submission. Trap the leg before we secure the strangle. The leg is trapped. We've already shoved the leg, and that's the key to the escape pass. The key to escaping the darts is generating movement and to being able to open up the shoulders and neck. And usually that can be done through big bridging pressure. So obviously a great darts is to control the top leg. So one more time. We'll get it from a sangle. So again, we're in our side smash here. Tyler's showed up. I'm pulling his head. He pulls back. He pulls back. And again, don't hold it so tight. Tyler can't move. Give him a bit of hope. So when he pulls the head, because that way he's going to believe he can do it. And eventually he opens up. I scissor my arms here. You can see my elbow's tight. We secure a hand to the bicep as deep as we can. And then we lift the hand that grabbed the bicep. We lift that arm's elbow. So we lock it. Elbow comes up as we secure the other hand. I drive a bit of weight in so I can hook that leg. And now we're in a great position to start applying this submission pressure. So that would be the first dart set up, right? Again, fatigue the neck, trap the leg before you commit to the strangle. Darts number two is from the cradle position, right? We talked about how we could possibly set up the cradle. And that was out of a front head, right? So we had our front head position here. We set over the leg. And I pull and push my hip in. So now we've already trapped Tyler on his side. So let's do the angles. So you can see I've trapped this top leg already. Again, we're trapping the leg before we commit to the strangle. We're not committing to the strangle without the leg trapped. Because if we don't trap the leg prior and he escapes the darts, now we could end up on bottom. We're in a scramble position. If we can't get the darts with the leg trapped, we're still great. This is still a great pinning position here. And we can start setting it up the exact same way. Pull the elbow, grab the bicep. Once you grab the bicep with your interior hand, as the outside hand comes up, pull your elbow higher. Tyler's trying to scramble out from here. But that leg shelf is what's securing us. Such a tight, tight darts there, right? So the details of the grip exchange. Retract the elbow, left hand deep. When you grab this bicep, as your right hand comes up, lift your elbow. Don't go here, here, and then try to lift. We grab our bicep, and these things happen at the same time. We're trying to do this style of movement. And again, you can get cradles out of unique positions too. Even if he has a form of guard, knee shield here, and I'm applying weave pressure, and Tyler starts to come up, we have that leg shelf available to us. So look at it from the other angle as well. So I'm in a knee shield position. I punch my weave hand through. I cover the head, and Tyler starts feeding into me. We immediately shelf this leg, and we keep pressure on Tyler. Tyler's trying to get up. He's having trouble. He's making openings for us. So here, as he tries to get up, that's what allows us to stop feeding. And remember, look at the difference between the time to tap here. If I grab the bicep, lift my right hand higher, and then try to lift the elbow when we commit to it, we get the tap, right? If we retract the elbow, and as we do this single grip exchange, when we grab the bicep and this hand climbs, the elbow climbs at the same time. We've already got the tap. So again, retract, place the hand on the bicep. As your right hand feeds higher, your left elbow feeds higher. Then we can start applying weight. But again, the key here is just the shelved leg control principle. If this leg's shelved, the legs are split, I've got weight on Tyler, he tries to get up. Very, very difficult here, and that's when toss opportunities start to come up. So again, as this hand, the outside hand comes up, so does the inside elbow. And we start generating that submission pressure. So again, a fatigued neck is a weak and vulnerable neck. The leg trapped prior to DARS commitment is a DARS that has a fail safe, that we maintain top control even if we lose the submission. [♪ music playing ♪ All right, let's talk about one of, lately, probably my personal favorite submissions, and it is called the cow catcher. I believe the cow catcher is a way to pin people in wrestling, but we can do a variation of it where we don't have a chin strap, but we have a high elbow position. Sorry, a high wrist position. So I'll show you from stand, like, it works really good. If Tyler's taking a shot, and I've caught an underhook on this side, right? And we switch sides now. And instead of a chin strap, we'll go on high wrist. So if you can see my fingers here. And why this is good is because I can punch my left arm to the far shoulder. And you see what it's doing to Tyler's upper body? It's forcing him to turn. And when we're using the high wrist position, we're basically doing a power half here. It's going to be a power half mechanism to turn them onto their back here. So it's a really great way to pin and hit a man return. So we've got an underhook, and we're looking for high wrist position. So even if Tyler's trying to keep his balance here, we can lift that shoulder, and we can knock him down here. So I'm trying to keep my weight off. I don't have sore hips. I'm bringing, here, Tyler's pretty comfortable. As I switch hips to face, Tyler tries to move. So you can see we've created an effective pin, and we also started to both strangle him and compress the chest. Because if we're applying chest pressure here, and his hands are away from his body, he feels that pressure. But if you combine it with head up pressure, it really emphasizes that chest compression. So again, if you want to learn how to do it off the standing position, as they shoot underhook, guillotine position, and we create a power half motion by turning him. And you can see I've switched my hips. Here, he survives again. As we start to switch hips, and again, we can be as nice as we want to be, right? So I don't just fully commit to it. Tyler's uncomfortable here, but he's not getting hurt. If I pull on his head too hard, he's going to get hurt. So I'm thinking more of a chest compression pin. So Tyler's not in pain here, but he's running out of oxygen. And then we get the submission, right? So we can also do this from out of our leg rights. Obviously, which is why I bring it up, right? So if they're ever not protecting the underhook space, we can commit shoulder to shoulder pressure here. Now we've taken advantage of this space, right? If you wanted to take the underhook back, it's kind of hard with the way we're committing pressure to the legs here because I'm driving shoulder pressure into this arm here. I'm getting to use our head to somewhat block it here. And then what we're going to do is we're going to dive our arm over. And obviously, it's a tough angle to create a high-risk position. But even if we just place our hands on our own chest here, it basically meets their chest in the same position. So I go over the head and I lift my hips. I'm still pinning this outside leg momentarily here. I step off of his legs, and then we start to switch hips. So you can see there's a great deal of chest pressure on Tyler here. And we eventually get the submission. So why I think these positions cause more injuries and submissions in the average gym is because it's not an immediate submission. Catch a re-naked, two, three seconds, that guy's tapping, right? He's going to go unconscious. Chest compressions take longer, so guys think it's not working. When they lack technique and understanding, they think just do it harder. So obviously, if Tyler's neck just needs to be bent a little bit to create effective chest compression submission, but it might take four seconds to get the submission, I just need to hold him at this safe range. The answer isn't keep pulling until he taps. That's going to injure your training partner's neck. And it's probably why moves like this have such a bad name. So again, we've taken advantage of this pocket of space here, and I've secured an underhook. I dive over the head while still pinning his top leg. I reach as deep as I can reach, and I open my chest. So as I hop off the legs, Tyler's trying to move here. So I've created enough pressure here to start generating submission pressure. So he's being strangled here, but let's count it out. And we've got it. All right, so let's count it, right? Let's give him a couple breaths first. He's going to start making seal noises again. All right, so let's count it out. One, two, three, four, five, six, and we get the ten, right? He's not going to submit quicker to a compression by ripping his neck up. He might tap quicker because it hurts his neck, but hopefully Tyler doesn't prove me wrong here, but there's no amount of pressure we're applying to his neck here that's going to injure his neck. But we need a bender to complete the compression or the strangle side of things. So again, cow catcher, very safe. Obviously, everything's dangerous if put in the wrong hands, but it is safe. You just need to not rip your opponent's neck off in hitting it. But again, I think it's very important in the context of ADCC, defending takedowns to score points in pinning positions. So I really think it should be a crucial part of the game and it's not just a neck crack. Let's talk about wrist control. There's going to be wrist locks involved in this situation. So again, I don't think wrist locks are a great submission overall because it's a dangerous one to play with in training because sometimes you have to apply it so viciously. They don't have time to tap. If you apply it too gently, sometimes they can slip out. It's one of those ones you want to be careful who you teach it to because some of your training partners are just complete idiots and they barely even have the safety to do more regular, more controlled submissions. But we can use wrist lock pressure to create straight arm bar pressure, Kimura pressure, and I want to talk about how we can do it. So we've got Tyler in our pin position again. So I call this, I don't even know, like a Spider-Man grip because it's kind of like I'm shooting web. We'd have to ask the comic book expert here. We control the wrist and I apply palm in pressure here and it's opening Tyler's elbow away from his body. And now it's my body weight versus Tyler's arm here. So we're coming in, Tyler's trying to resist. Very difficult to resist this pressure, right? And again, obviously we could create wrist lock style pressure here, but that's not going to be, it's not going to be very high percentage. I just want to demonstrate that even if we use two hands, I'm still going to emphasize getting our palms behind it. Tyler's trying to resist, very weak. This would be like doing a push-up with this pressure here. But the idea is if I can get a wrist control, and again, we'd probably be seeing this situation where they're trying to frame inside this bicep here exactly and we can start. So I'm not sitting back here being like doing some Steven Seagal pressure like this, right? So we are still on top of him here, maybe they're looking for inside bicep control and we find our wrist control here. Generally speaking, I just do it to create an opening, which we could switch to an underhook. But if we wanted to go straight to the submission, Tyler cannot easily resist this and he cannot face it. He cannot face it because of this. If I wasn't on this leg and he could turn the other way or if he could turn this way into it here, he's going to start to lose this space here. So we're pinning him in one direction, we're applying wrist lock pressure in the other. So again, underhooks there if you want it, or we start to dive over the top and lock up Kumura pressure. Because I'm weighted towards Tyler's left, he's trying to move, resist, we can start using this. If he keeps his arm straight, I can apply straight arm bar pressure. So I can rotate his thumb to the sky here. And we're creating that bridging pressure underneath our elbow here. So if Tyler's resisting, you can see it's very difficult here. We've got quite a solid pin and I'm rolling his elbow over. So again, it's all in the wrist here. Or if he bends his elbow here, we've got our Kumura game here where we could start to step over the head and apply that pressure here and really trying to get his hand behind his shoulder here. If I wanted to get the break, I flare my elbow. So again, it's not about pulling the hand as far as we can this way, it's about getting it to a tension point and then flaring our elbow to create the break here. So again, we've got those two options here, right? We've got that cutting arm bar style or we've got that Kumura style pressure here. Maintaining control over the leg pin as long as possible. So they're fighting inside here, we control the wrist. I commit weight over the top of his shoulder and his arm. That's when we take advantage of that rolling pressure. But if he's bending it, we can take advantage of Kumura pressure. Another even option here is to switch to basically a one-handed style Kumura here. So if his arm's hiding here, I can pass off and control his wrist here. So we've got the two-on-one Kumura or if we could pass the hand off to one, I start to square up with him here and I start to pull his arm back. So you see we've still got a good pin here. I've got chest to chest pressure, my free hand is blocking the hips. Tyler's trying to move. As he moves, we start to pull his hand underneath his shoulder here. So finally, we've got a few different submissions. Sometimes guys will just tap straight to the wrist lock, but again, we're using it to create underhooks. We're using it to lock up straight arm bar. If they bend it, a standard Kumura here, he's got a bad shoulder, I'm being careful. We can create that pressure or we can pass it off to a one-handed Kumura, emphasizing pinning pressure here, starting to pull back. So again, just some fun tricks you can throw in there as well to scare people about where their hand position is when we have the lower body pinned. But just a great principle to control a wrist is to use your palm to rotate their elbow out and then they're having to basically fight into you with wrist locking pressure just to get back to the neutral position they were in. So we can also use our pin positions and the threat of submission to lead us to arguably more dominant positions. So my argument isn't that the pins are the absolute best positions for submissions, but they're the best control positions that safely lead to submissions. So a position such as the Gift Wrap where our opponent's on the shoulder, that would be a great both control and submission position. We have submission opportunities where we could fall back, but we have those safe submission opportunities that we talked about today that involve staying firmly on top, remaining in control, respecting the fact that our opponent might be too dangerous for us to risk conceding such a good position. So if I have Adam here in the leg split here. So if we want to think about setting up an arm triangle, Adam knows that the shoulder to the floor is death here, right? It means he's going to feel the submission pressure, he's going to get submitted, he might even start making strange noises like the last hook gate. But knowing full well to keep his shoulder up to reduce the chance of the arm triangle, basically reduce it to none, also leads us to great opportunities to upgrade submission. So if I'm reaching deep trying to set up arm triangle and I'm just like, I cannot get it, we switch off to a claw and I can hop my knee higher and step straight into a Gift Wrap position. So we bypass the entire mount battle of trying to get arms high, elbows high, climb up the mount, switch to a position like this, switch to an S-mount prior to this. We've forgone all those battles just by setting up a high mount from down here. And then obviously you can easily switch to a Gift Wrap style position. So again, we're down here in our side split, we're setting up an arm triangle and they're reaching into us because they know that's the proper defense. But of course that gives us the opportunity to get knee higher and basically line ourselves up into this Gift Wrap position here. And again, we know we're safe to do this because they're defending at arm triangles. Obviously if I were to try to step to a Gift Wrap as the shoulder goes back to the floor, we're still in a good spot but not as dominant a spot, right? So we can bait this up on the side mounted Gift Wrap position by setting it up down here. So I'm going for arm triangle, they're resisting, switch to a shallow claw grip. I keep waiting him here so now even if he wanted to go back, it's very, very difficult. Knee goes high, foot goes high, immediately switch to the Gift Wrap. And straight away we have great submission opportunities here. I can step my leg over, catch my ankle here, I can start to lean forward and you see how I'm pulling his head into the strangle here so that when I lock up my feet, we're already in a very strong position. Obviously we want to create some rotational pressure so I could start reaching for the legs here. Adam's trying to move and wiggle out. Very tough and we get that submission. So we're in our Gift Wrap here. Obviously again, I could chair sit to take the back, I could take an arm bar and fall backwards. But everything we're trying to do here today is we dominate top position, we stay on top, we submit from top. So I step through and grab my ankle straight away. I roll my elbow into his head here, already applying strangling pressure here. Arguably we could get the submission here but we want to reinforce and close everything up. So I roll weight on top of him, lock it up deep, activate the ankles here. We start to lean forwards to finish. I'm trying to bend his arm trap and his head into the strangle. And if I want extra control, I reach for the leg here. So look, if he's trying to explode out, we get a good noise out of him. But again, when we're holding this leg from the triangle, acting as a leg shelf all the same. But again, don't be caught up in only remaining in the leg rides. The leg rides are a great intermediary position but if we can bypass standard positions into high mounts, for sure, going to be a great option. Going to be a great control position. You can see we have a high percentage triangle we can attack out of the gift wrap. Let's talk about using the half Nelson to create back exposure, but it's belly now and back exposure. So again, we talked about in upper body tools, how the half Nelson can be used to turn people. So obviously in the context of wrestling, half Nelson can be used to attempt to pin an opponent by forcing them to roll onto their back and obviously pinning positions. For the sake of Jiu Jitsu, we can use it from positions like mount or any of the positions we've covered today, any of these pinning style positions. We can use it to force them to turn onto their belly to obviously start setting up strangles. So again, you'd have to check the rules of the tournament. In terms of IPGF, they might start calling this a neck crank, so it might be illegal. Obviously, if you're competing in the kids division, it's probably illegal. Again, 80cc, half Nelson is fine because if they move with the movement, they're relieving pressure, so I don't consider it an illegal technique. But a full Nelson, just for the sake of demonstration purposes here, a move that I love to do to Placido actually, which is a legal technique, but he inspires me with it. So we have Tyler down here. So guys, most of these moves are interchangeable, right? Like I've been telling you, I've been teaching most of our parts of submission from here, but for the most part, they're all going to move, work the same from a ton of our pin positions. So again, for the sake of varying it up, we'll talk about using it from the leg shelf style Khabib right here. So again, typically speaking, the time that this half Nelson comes up is they're reaching for our legs here. So we can start to strip that grip, right? It doesn't even need to be that far, just enough that as we drape our weight across, we can place that fist in the armpit here. We can even start to force it. So you can see how that's encouraging Tyler to want to turn belly down because we're generating pressure in his neck. If Tyler tries to turn belly up, obviously it's going to be very difficult, but it's also going to hurt his neck. So when we use this half Nelson to create belly down pressure, I can start to flatten Tyler out here and start reaching to apply re-nakeds. Obviously, if we get here and Tyler starts looking to generate high, we're looking to open those elbows. So to be patient is key here. We can start looking for re-naked pressure. Again, sometimes it might take a couple. So we lift the chin, come back under and finish exactly how it would in any regular re-naked circumstance. So just to show you as well from the position we've done most of our work from, Tyler's pushing on our leg here. We can clear that arm out. If I put weight on it, it's going to be hard for Tyler to fight this. So we just need to hold it long enough to bring weight over their upper body. We place the hand under the armpit and start to straighten our hand. Sometimes you'll find one arm is enough, but again, if they're providing pretty good resistance here, I would just try to reinforce them with a second. You can see I'm going to use my chest to complete this movement here. So rolling Tyler over here. If he starts to build height, we're trying to keep those elbows open. Obviously, if he gives us a wrist ride, that's good again. So you see here, chest pressure, hip pressure, and Tyler's trying to move, but he's going to expose the neck here. Most of the time, he'll be able to finish this one hand, Garot style. But again, we can dive through to complete the re-naked. As long as we keep that weight on top, we'll be able to finish the re-naked without hooks. Because we have hooks from our back with our opponent on top to apply re-naked pressure to limit their lateral movement. Because if we have a re-naked on someone without hooks, obviously it works from time to time, but seasoned guys can start to change the angles of the shoulders to weaken the grip. So for the most part, you would want hooks to finish a re-naked. But obviously, if we're finishing a re-naked from top without hooks, my body weight limits the bottom guy's ability to move. He's basically in a pin. So we don't need that extra layer of hooks, even though they would improve the position. But I wouldn't say don't go for a re-naked without hooks. So again, we covered this previous in the tool section, how to create back exposure with them belly down with a half-nail serve. But here's just to see in context how it would come up in sort of a submission pathway. Alright, so some final thoughts on basically what we've covered in this product. I think it could be a healthy direction the sport could head because I think we are somewhat limited by the framework of the point structure we've been taught since day one. And again, I emphasize this all the time. It's not just competition gyms that are limited in this framework. But it's typical, your average gym as well, because most instructors think about it in the framework, think about control in the framework of the positions that are standard to the sport. Again, most of your instructors are going to be buying instructions from BJJ Fanatics. And a lot of those instructions are going to be structured in such a way that reflect the known positions of the sport. So they're going to be looking for side control, attack series, mount attack series, back submission series, things of that nature. But if we step back and think about what we're trying to do in grappling, and I think what we're trying to do is control the bottom guy. We want to back people into a corner to minimize the amount of good options they have. And when I say good options, I don't just mean offensive options. I mean, defensive escape routes, right? So if we do only focus on passing the guard, scoring those points, or taking those positions where we comfortably know submission pathways from, I feel like we, to a certain degree, hold ourselves back. I think if we think outside the box and think about this new type of system of leg riding and controlling the legs, pinning the legs because they're the most powerful part of the body, we can both improve our ability to hold the bottom guy down and as a result, increase our submission rate. So again, it's about basically, even in a competition setting, some of the guys that leave lasting legacies on the sport are the guys that change the sport. They bring something new to the equation. Obviously, everyone remembers how devastating heel hooks were to traditional black belts, traditional grapplers. I think in this sense of pinning control, I think when you guys start to get good at this, develop this in your game, your training partners are probably going to comment on how much harder it is for them to fight effectively off of their back or even survive from their back. And again, this isn't me showing you this super uncomfortable way to make your training partners uncomfortable. You can use whatever amount of pressure is necessary to control the bottom guy. I just think we need to emphasize this type of control. At all costs, we should focus on pinning the bottom guy and using pathways to submission rather than just trying to score as many points as possible. So depending on when this comes out, I'm trying to develop a rule set myself that tries to reward controlling the bottom guy and also tries to reward the bottom guy escaping back to the feet as much as possible. I think those two things have largely been forgotten. I think the rules we developed for the sport and competition jiu-jitsu moved us in a different direction to what I would argue is superior forms of control. So keep your eyes peeled. I think we can change some of the rules of the sport to both make it more exciting and to also set it down a path. I don't want to be that guy that says it's more realistic and it'll work in a fire, but it's set it down a path that just looks really like what I think two guys wrestling for control should look like. Basically, if you asked any person off the street what two grapplers would be trying to do, they'd probably say the top guy's trying to hold the bottom guy down, the bottom guy's trying to get up, and obviously the submission's involved as well. But I think from that framework of control, we can really start to look at new ways to develop the sport. I don't want to be that guy that loses all the time and changes the rules of the sport so that he can find a rule set he can win in or probably lose in this rule set too. I exploited the current meta of the sport to the extreme. I just pulled guard every match, went for leg locks all the time, and that's how I created my career, my legacy in the sport. But even me, with that sub meta of the game that I was very, very effective in, I still think there's better ways we can grapple to become more well-rounded grapplers and set the sport in a direction that's both more entertaining and more realistic in the sense I've described here today. Again, give this series of techniques a shot and ask yourself if you're finding your ability to control the bottom guy has gone up or down since you've stopped thinking about your typical point scoring positions.
