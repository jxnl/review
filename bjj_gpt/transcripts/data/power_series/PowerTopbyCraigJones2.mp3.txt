 We're going to clarify supine position again and how we address it. Again, we're not thinking in terms of passing guards. So again, we're not, if I see Tyler flat on his back, I'm not closing the range to try to come in between his legs and work my passes from the De La Riva, reverse De La Riva. I don't want to do any of this. I don't want to give Tyler an inch. I don't want to basically approach his guard somewhat that of someone I'm so superior that I can just match technique for technique and run right through it. And I think a lot of guys that want to test themselves in the gym and work bad positions, get into a bad habit. Guys that are the best guy in their team, they think, all right, let's give this guy on bottom De La Riva because I'll probably end up here in an event. And then let me pass his guard. Same again, reverse De La Riva. Same again with butterfly guard. They try to handicap themselves as they approach a position like this to make the role more competitive. And I think those habits follow along to your competition performance. I think the habits should be developed in the gym. And again, like I said, Tyler is giving himself very little risk. His only risk is really to be passed. There's very little risk when he plays like this of getting submitted. And again, we want to keep a range that is so far that I can touch here, but he can't touch my feet. We don't want to be mid-range where we can touch him and he can grab our leg. We don't want to be short range where he can grab a guard. When he's supine, our range is out here. We can touch his feet, he can't touch our feet. And the beauty of this position is, Tyler has very little movement forwards and backwards here. It's easier for me to keep this safe range established. If Tyler is seated, I have to always be aware of where my feet are because he can quickly scoot towards me and start to get grips. Something we don't have to worry about with supine. So I can gently come in and start looking for grips, whatever those grips may be. So again, when we approach supine, I won't go into this in too much detail again. I don't want to repeat myself 35 times. But again, his risk is low. His risk is only to be passed. Very little submission risk. My risk is that he can establish a guard. So I want to play a range that I can touch his legs, but he cannot touch my legs or establish a guard. So that is generally how we're going to approach this position. We pass prior to him establishing a guard. We don't pass his guards. All right, guys, when we approach this supine position in a perfect world, our range is always that safe distance where I can touch his feet. I can touch his legs, but he cannot reach my legs. Not only can he not reach my legs, he cannot therefore in turn establish a guard. So I want to approach Tyler's guard the same way women approach middle-aged men with Mohawks. And that is I'm going to keep my distance and if he ever gets any sort of grip on me, any sort of close contact, I immediately strip it and address it. So let's do it. Tyler's at 25. I didn't mean him. So guys, if we do come in and say, let's look at it from this angle, I'm coming in, I get too close. I get a right hand grab. We have to immediately address this. And that means I'm going to have to let go of the legs, strip that grip, step back and re-approach the guard. I don't need to strip the grip and run away. I just need to strip that grip and reassess my distance here. So look, Tyler's arm is almost fully extended here. So if I step back here, we're out of range again. So this is part of the difficulty. And I guess you can approach it almost like people doing striking where they know where their opponents are out of range to hit them. Those safe spots, right? So we don't need to be too far away. We can basically still be in the pocket here, but we don't want him to establish any sort of grip. So it can even happen if we approach and we end up in a De La Riva style here, right? I need to address this immediately. So I don't just see this and go, oh, plan A went badly. Let's go back to standard passing because he's established a guard. We don't need to do that here. I can reach through, strip that grip, kick out and re-approach the guard. We can go for that passing style again. So a little drill, I want you guys to practice, right? You guys can obviously do this with a training partner. You can do it as a standalone drill. You could pick some of the place guards like this, don't tell them and just slowly strip every grip. So you can even approach this incorrectly, right? Just to get a feel for your range, right? So you can start trying to work out where they can touch you. And the second they go, strip it. Something I learned in Jiu Jitsu and I believe it applies to Nogi too, is that the longer I allow Tyler to hold a grip, the more well established it is, the harder for it to break. So look what Tyler's done already. Initially he grabbed it, then he placed his elbow on it, then he might even switch that elbow to his butt. Now there's three layers to this grip. So we need to address it immediately. Tyler gets it, I strip, step back and start posting on the legs, start controlling those legs. Because again, another way Tyler can establish a grip before he reaches with his upper body is if I'm not controlling the inside leg, that could gently come inside and hook. So now it's harder for me to move my leg and he can use this sort of little bit of contact to grab my foot. And now he's established a guard. Now he's established a guard in sequence from those movements. And again, the longer he has this guard, the more well set up it's going to be. So what we need to practice is give him a grip, take it away. So start the drill where we're coming in, he grabs something, strip it, try to stay close. We're moving in both directions, he gets another grip, I strip that grip. Anytime he grabs it, strip it. We're going to practice this drill. But again, like I said, don't give him a grip, strip it and come too far away. Because now he squares back up perfectly, obviously down the line he can stand up. But it means he gets his legs facing us again. So every time you strip a grip, I want you to try and keep a pretty good angle so that he has to over commit that. So you might try to hook again, you strip that immediately and we keep playing. So it's a little fun drill we can do and it's basically we're going to give them nothing. It builds into us the idea that we're not allowing them to have anything. They've conceded the first battle, but we're not going to play the game. We're not going to give them that unspoken rule where we allow them to establish a guard we pass. We practice this drill where we give him a grip, strip it, give him a grip, strip it and then ultimately down the line it develops our range to a level where we know exactly where we are safe and where we are not safe. Let's take a look at a drill called the dirty feet drill. That's basically I don't want Tyler's feet to be facing me in any way. I want to stay outside his feet. We can use different grip sequences to try and keep that. But basically don't use this drill to just dominate your training partner and pass. Just try to keep them in that gray area where they're struggling. Like you might get to a good angle there. You might start heading towards the shoulder line, facing back towards the legs and then you can for the sake of the drill, for the sake of practice, because it's going to happen in real life, you're not going to clear it, pass. It's going to take countless, countless opportunities and a ton of pressure like I emphasized in the introduction. But just give a bit of room, allow them to try to square back up and either over correct him so they're trying to square back up, we throw him past to stay out of range or the last second prevent it and walk back towards the head. This is actually a good drill for Tyler because he doesn't own shoes. So anytime I roll with him regularly I see his feet and I think get those fucking things away from him. So again, Tyler, he's always a guy in the gym like that right? So again, just for evidence. But again, for the sake of the 30 feet drill, I don't want these things pointing at me right? I want to keep them to the outside. So you guys can play around with grips and we're going to go into these in more detail. But even something as simple as I push and I walk away. We can even use a cross grip and point and walk away. And then as Tyler starts correcting here, we can grab the other leg, we can throw up. But again, remember this is just for a fun bit of practice, playing with range here. Your training partner can lightly reach the feet, we can keep them out of range here, we don't want to give them nothing. So you can see as Tyler corrects, I can make him over correct. Or as he goes to go for it, as he goes to take up, I can block it and walk back to the head. But obviously here, it's a fun drill, we want this drill to keep going. So I relieve a little bit of pressure. Tyler corrects. We're just keeping these feet away right? So you can see sometimes I push his legs, sometimes I hold it and I hop. And that's how we can practice keeping those feet away. But again, a really crucial skill. And it's turned into a bit of a game, but it's going to really fatigue the bottom guy. So keep it playful, keep it a game. Don't obviously pick the right training partners to do these things with. You guys know exactly who I'm talking about. We can also do the previous drill with one hand, which actually fits pretty well with Tyler because I look at him and I'm like, I don't really want to touch two hands on the man. So I try to just use one hand whenever I make physical contact with him. So we can do the same drill right? I would recommend just, it's not as easy to hit a toyanda with one hand. If Tyler is extending his leg into me, sure we can guide him a bit easier. But get in the habit of either grabbing, and we can do those cross grips as well. So sometimes we might establish one hand. As we start to create an angle, we do the pass off. So obviously when we're here, it's very easy for me to get that reverse, sorry very difficult to get the reverse grip. Very easy to take an outside grip. We need to create an angle. So obviously if I just pushed and Tyler resisted, that's pretty tough. See two hands, we can throw him by a bit easier right? But if we need to get that cross grip, which is going to be the best grip to practice these toyanda style drills, it's not like grabbing and if he's resisting and I can't push, I just move. And then I do a pass off here. So now as Tyler is trying to follow, and if he does get back in, we switch it off right? So I'm keeping pressure in, so it's a one hand drill, but I'm only using one at a time. By that, obviously both hands are in play, but I'm only touching with one hand at a time right? So say if we stacked him here, he might actually invert here. Obviously those inversions are a bit tougher in your 30s, you know what I mean? So one at a time, if he does square back up to us, back to square one right? We touch the foot, we create an angle, we pass it off. Tyler comes back in, we're blocking him here, we don't want these dirty things touching us here. Only one hand at a time right? So another very useful drill that teaches you that we don't just have to move them, we can use our hand as a frame to move around them. We're making them move, making them react, frustrating them, getting them emotional, fatiguing them. But this is just two simple drills to practice your control. Alright, let's take a look at Torriondo's for no gi. Again, super effective, a lot of people think we can only do it on the gi, because obviously gi gets some real good grips, but there are some mechanisms which we can hit Torriondo's no gi and they are super effective and again, super safe, which is most important here. We're approaching dangerous guards, hard to pass guards, we want to maintain our safety while we do this. So let's look at this. Tyler is in this supine position here. So we're going to start with what I think is probably one of the most basic versions of this and it really relies on our training partner's reaction in this position. So obviously we've got our range here, again we can approach it, I can touch Tyler's legs, he can't touch mine. So I'm just grabbing both achilles here, I'm curling my thumbs around, I'm trying to get a good grip on these, not too close to the ankles here, because I find they kick out very easy, but as far down as we can really control it. So I'm pressing his feet to his butt and I start to walk around, I create an angle here, I start to walk around, I know Tyler is going to want to turn to face me here and really he's going to want to turn to face me and then square back up. Exactly, this is where he feels most safe here. So I use that mechanism as he turns to drag his feet along the floor and use momentum to carry him through here. So again I push his feet in and really his instinctual response when you push is to push back. So that's already helping us here. So I stop him, I create an angle and we create that momentum here. So again just for demonstration purposes I'm trying to launch Tyler, but we catch those ankles, when I'm pushing his feet to his butt, look he wants to push it back here. Already we're good, gravity is holding me down, body weight is holding me down. Tyler's extending with muscular strength here, the little muscular strength he has. So we start to create an angle here, Tyler starts to correct, we bring his feet along the ground. So if I demonstrate without someone, I don't create an angle and turn him. I create an angle and I drag his feet along the ground, let go, recapture the feet, we reverse press. We've got those ankles, you can see we get quite a bit of momentum on them right. Obviously I'm exaggerating here, but just to see the power you can draw out. And I immediately catch those ankles here and ultimately try to bring my elbows inside here so he's carrying my weight. That is the first Tori Ando version we're going to do. Building upon the fact we know it's going to be a strong response. Capture the Achilles, push in, create an angle, as they square up, drag their feet, recapture the ankles here. This is a great position. We've hit the shoulder line here, very strong position for us, very weak position for Tyler. Tyler's carrying our weight in such a manner that his knees are being pushed away from his chest. For Tyler to try and keep his knees to his chest here, he has to deal with the addition of our body weight here, it's going to fatigue him. Even if we do this, he gets his guard back, squares back up, he only has a few, he only has a certain amount of ability to keep carrying our weight here. So again, it's not the be all and all. People teach guard passes like, I do this, he does that, I do this, we pass. Really, we're working, we're working, we're working, it's going to take time. It's going to take time. Consider it like the saying in boxing, if you look for the knockout, you never find it. If you're doing good fundamentals, stick into the game plan, it'll suddenly be present to you. I think of guard passing the same way. The more aggressively or overeager I look for the pass, the more problems I have. If I follow good passing principles, we'll wear them down, eventually they give the pass to us. Let's take a look at a second version of the Toriando, which is basically touch and go. So if Tyler's flat on his back here, his head's facing the wall here, just here. If Tyler relaxes his back, his head's on the ground, he's got a greater surface area touching the ground here. And the greater the surface area, the more friction he's going to have. Don't worry, that's about as scientific as we're going to get over here in this one. But if Tyler brings his knees to his chest and he grounds his upper spine, you can see now that there's less surface area on the ground. And obviously if there's less surface area on the ground, there's less friction, it'll be much easier for us to start spinning him. Compare that to if he relaxes, everything's flat, too much friction. And obviously if Tyler squares up to me here, and he's in good posture, everything's tight, which again is good guard passing prevention principles. He's leaving very little space here. And as a result, less of his spine's on the ground, meaning it's much easier for us to start hitting Toriandos. So for the touch and go, I'm going to grab close to the knee here. Because his knees are close to his chest, I want to keep him there. I want to take advantage of that small amount of friction. If I grab down here, potentially the lower back's on the ground, it's going to be harder for us to create rotation. So we grab one close to the knee, and I try to grab a reverse grip. Anything I can do to create some friction here, some groin extension here, right? If the groin's extended and tight, it's easier for me to move Tyler here. But the trick is the second we touch it, we go. Obviously the detail's in the name, right? So I'm above Tyler, we can start spinning him here, right? And we can start creating back friction. So when you're drilling this with your training partner, ensure that you've got tight, sorry, you've got loose short shorts and no underwear. So as Tyler comes underneath, he gets a peak every time. So I want you to practice just that ability to spin him here. So we touch and we go. We touch and we go. Tyler's probably going to put in a work safety claim for this, but again, he could only do it if he was a legal resident, right? But some of the best times to hit the touch and go is the second a grip gets stripped, right? So this is the secret. Tyler doesn't even know where he is anymore. So let's say he establishes a grip here, I strip it, I step, we go straight away. One of the best moments. So again, he grabs a grip, we strip it, we touch and we go, and we end up hopefully hitting our angle here. But again, we hit here, it doesn't necessarily mean we're going to pass. So you've got to rework how you think about this position. Don't think that what I'm teaching you as a traditional guard boss, think about it as we're working towards a goal. We're hammering away at their guard. We're fatiguing them, frustrating them, ultimately somewhere down the line, we're going to get that pass, but don't go, I hit the toriando, I didn't pass, it didn't work. That's money in the bank. That's us fatiguing them. Again, all directed towards the goal we're seeking to achieve down the line. Last toriando, hand on hip toriando. So this one is effective. We can still do it from a square position, but really we kind of want them on a hip to achieve this move. So I'll show you both, make more sense when you see what I'm talking about here. So when we're approaching a square position, we are at good range for a standard toriando. But if I go to reach through hand on hip, I'm now sort of in the mid-range. Tyler might be able to create some attachment with his leg, even if it's on a reverse de la line, even this is going to affect my hand on hip toriando. So I would recommend, Tyler's here, everything's tight. If I start to create, let's see if I can get this angle. If I start to create an angle out here, likely he's going to fall to his hip. This is a great spot to start setting up the hand on hip. So we're going to place and reach our hand through and cup the top of the leg here. So I sort of stay in a middle ground here. My fingers are on top of the knee, my palm is inside the knee. So that way I have both the ability to pin it and push it. But obviously, something that's problematic for this one is if Tyler throws a lasso. That is really irritating here. That can sort of fuck up our whole passing game. So when we reach, I reach with my head as well. Tyler throws the lasso and now I start to run his inside knee back so that we can get him on his outside hip. And we're going to achieve that hand on hip mechanism. And you see again, we've landed in a non-point scoring position, basically leg drag style, where ultimately we could punish Tyler from this position or obviously choose to consolidate the pass. We could even upgrade to leg riding here. So again, don't just think of the hand on hip tourando as a means to a pass. Think of it as something a bit more open-ended. So again, if I want Tyler on a hip, I just walk to that direction. He's going to follow me. So again, we want him on this hip. We can come in right. So same thing again, head to hand. So we come through the lasso. If we're here, that damn lasso comes in right. So head to hand, we run that leg back. And again, obviously I haven't passed, but Tyler's in a tough spot here. Obviously a leg drag and we could come up and start riding those legs to start fatiguing him. We could still hit this from a square stance, right? But I want you to pay attention to my right leg as I go for it. I'm going to grab my grips and I'm going to like donkey kick back because I don't want his inside leg or his right hand to grab it right. If I come into range and I stay out here too long, he's going to grab my leg or this foot's going to interfere with us. So if I'm here, we're going to come in and start running around. It would be the same mechanism if we've come in for a knee cut and Tyler doesn't grab. Say he forgets to use this hand to grab my foot. If he grabs my foot, he and I hit toriando one leg from here. If he doesn't, we can actually donkey kick back out of there. So if I come in and we follow those same principles, but again, well ultimately we won't necessarily end up in the pass, but we can keep pummeling. Let's take a look at a version if they do, if they're very, very fast at throwing this lassoing. So obviously we can beat it by bringing our head to hand, but you can see first my hand goes to the hip, then my head goes to my hand. And obviously given the smell down there, there might be other preferences as well. So if we're worried about that lasso, I pummel off. We're doing like a wax on, wax off, Mexican karate variation here. So as Tyler goes, the lower hand cups behind the Achilles here and the upper hand grabs the other leg. So we're pinning this leg. So as Tyler's trying to retain guard, we can throw those legs past. He brings his knees to his chest and we get to that shoulder line. So again, we're here. Tyler goes to throw the lasso. We cup. Wax on, wax off. As he goes, and always drill it like we're drilling it. Tyler's been a good training partner here, so when we do this exchange, I come past. Tyler doesn't just go limp. This would never happen. As I create an angle, Tyler brings his knees to his chest and that gives us this immediate response where we control the Achilles. We start applying pressure and build that habit. So again, we create an angle. We get to here. Immediately we do the pass off. And we create that north-south shoulder line angle here. So we're hand on hip, hand on leg. This lasso keeps coming in, so we're like, fuck it, we'll time it. Hands on hip as it comes in. Bottom hand pummels. Wax on, wax off. We switch. Hand on hip to bottom leg. Hand on bottom leg to upper leg. Looks like we're doing, what is it, Wing Chun yesterday? Yeah. But yeah, that's a hand on hip counter to the lasso grip coming back in. Let's talk about when we're at our safe range, we're controlling that distance, but our opponent starts giving us a completely different foot position. Obviously, if Tyler's feet are low, we can easily get over the top. But sometimes when we're here, they'll think, oh, we'll lift our feet. Obviously, it's hard for me to hit any sort of toriandos here, but the answer is super simple. We just come under the Achilles and we just walk them forward until their toes touch the ground and we can start to work our stacking leg. So again, we're approaching the guard, if the feet are low, over the top. Feet are high, come underneath the C grips and just walk forward. And we want those toes to touch the ground. And again, this is a follow up to what do we do after we toriando and we hit that shoulder one, is sometimes they bring their knees so close, we can actually achieve the same thing. And obviously, if Tyler stays still, Tyler's stacked, but my position is different. In one situation, I was here. In the other situation, I'm here. But we're actually going to do the same thing, right? So if Tyler's here, I'm going to start cutting an angle and stapling his leg to the ground. So I got to apologize to Tyler, it's going to be a rough part of the instruction. And we're still early days at this point, right? So what we can do from here is you can see I've stapled his leg to the mat here. And what I need to also do, because we want to keep him stacked. So I'm using my other leg as a shelf into his back here. So the mechanism of action is we're basically stapling with the inside knee and we're shelving his body with the outside. So I had control over the ankle here. And this is what I basically, this is basically our starting position here from which we work towards guard passes. But also, again, you can see here, this is a ton of pressure on Tyler. So it's one of those ones where it's like, we get someone here, we want to punish him. We want to really, again, punish him for having made this mistake. So again, if his feet are high, we come under, we walk those toes to the mat, I take a staple and I use my secondary leg and I turn my knee into his back here. We can reinforce it with our hands and we control the other ankle. So Tyler's trying to move here. Very, very difficult. But again, like obviously the ultimate goal would be maybe to take the pass and score our points. Right. But if you think about it, if I keep Tyler here for five minutes, then I pass, chances are it's going to be a totally different, a different person. I'm going to quit. Chances are because of the stress of it, because of the pressure, chances are that when we pass, he's much more like, we're much closer to the submission. Obviously being in sight control against the fresh guy and against the tired guy, they look entirely the same, but that same person is much closer to the submission in one of those situations than in the other. So again, we're entering the position out of two different styles, right? We're going for Toriando, but his feet are high. Well, that's like what we do. We come under, we run his toes to the mat, we take a staple, we shelf with the outside leg and we hold the hip here and we try to pin their toes to the ground. If they start penduling him and knocking you backwards, just recapture the feet and there'll be no pendulum at this point that we can re-staple here. So we're trying to keep those hips high. But again, we can enter it from Toriando, that shoulder line position, right? So we've landed here, we emphasize toes to the ground first, and then I start running for this staple here. So a knee staple, a shelf, we hold those hips and this is our base passing position. But again, it's our position in which we can punish the other player, the other training partner, or potentially your opponent here. But if you get someone in a stack, that is one of the worst possible positions to be put in, in all of Jiu Jitsu. So why would we rush that situation, right? Obviously, in the context of a safe training room, that can injure your training partner's necks. So be very careful there. I'd be very careful drilling it. I wouldn't recommend drilling it in the morning class. That's going to be the worst time to be crunched up on your neck there, or crunching your training partner's up. I think this is the thing that we need to drill, but obviously taking care of our training partners. We also need to, in a roll, depending upon who that person is, might be someone you're actually trying to injure their neck or their back. Hopefully, that's not the training room you're in. But again, in a roll, I would stack someone there. I would test my control. I'd stack them, hold them for a sec, and then take the pass that's presented to us. This is a situation where if Tyler's in pain, he could, again, do those things we call forced errors. They might make a technical error, they might be tired, or they might be under enough stress or anxiety that they make a bad decision, leading us to a good position. But this is a position where Tyler can't concede. He can't. I can hold him there. He can't give me something better. You know what I mean? He could tap, obviously, if he's back-turning. From a mount, he could give an arm triangle. You know what I mean? He could turn, he could give out the back. This particular position to stack is a non-point-soaring position, but it's absolutely hard. It's horrible to be stuck under. The longer you're there, the worse it's going to be. So in a competition environment, I'd recommend you stack someone. You keep them there a while. You punish them. You know what I mean? You make them really uncomfortable in that position. Even people with really healthy spines, even super flexible people, I would say, although they feel comfortable at a younger age in that position, it's not a good idea to constantly be stacked in those positions. You will regret it later in life if you guide our attention to do it around being stacked. So I would say, again, in a training environment, if you put someone in this position, practice your control, but just for a couple seconds. Stack them there, feel them wiggle a bit, be like, yeah, I've got control of the position. I understand the position. I feel good enough that I can do it in competition, and then take the pass. I would even recommend trying to force the pass. You know what I mean? Try to go for it from that position in the training room, because worst-case scenario, they end up retaining guard. But on the other hand, if you really held someone there for a while, worst-case scenario, they have a neck injury, they have a spine injury. Obviously, we don't want to do that to our training partners. I mean, we don't really want to do it to our opponents either, right? But I mean, we all want to win. But in a competition environment, the strategy should be different. One of the best guys doing this was Guy Mendez. In the Guy, Guy Mendez, obviously, incredible coach, world champion. I think sometimes he loses a bit of shine to his brother, because his brother was just one of the greatest of all time. But Guy Mendez had a passing system in the Guy where he would force you into a stack. He'd keep you there for a while. You'd be being punished in that position. You'd see Guy Mendez would break a lot of opponents just by forcing him into that stack. So I would take a page out of Guy's book, right? If we're in a competition environment, restack someone. Keep them there. Punish them. It's a stressful spot. You know what I mean? Even if you put someone there for two minutes, feel it out in the gym. Obviously, be mindful of your spine. But be stuck in a stack for two minutes, and then try to fight out of that position. You're going to be in much worse condition. I find in the gym when I stack someone here, they volunteer the pass. They're like, please, please, take this pass. You know what I mean? Take this better position. That's interesting, right? They'd rather give up points. They'd rather be in a point scoring position than in this dominant position that doesn't score points. Maybe that'll make you rethink how you approach jiu-jitsu and how, if you can approach it from a non-Ibgf point scoring style. Again, like we emphasized at the start, some of the best control positions don't score points. This would be one of them. But I lean on the side of caution in this one because, again, you could actually seriously injure your training partners. People have been stacked and forced over their own neck, and they've injured themselves. But what I'm trying to say is in the gym, play it safe. In competition, keep them there. Keep them there a long time. For the sake of filming this instructional, I'm making the sacrifice to you guys. I'm sacrificing Tyler's neck so we can really cover this position in detail. I'm going to keep him there for minutes upon minutes while we do the technique over and over again, explain it many times. But yeah, again, in competition, keep them there forever. In the training room, be kind to your training partners. Let's look at our passing options from the stack position. Again, I'm emphasizing passes from this position, but based on the methodology of the instructional, what we are seeking to do is to fatigue. So if we have to rest in the stack because we're cooking them, we don't think they're ready to be passed yet. We want to cook them a little longer, cook them a little longer. But again, we have to know the passes from this position. You can see Tyler's already in pain. We're in early days. So guys, we're in our passing, our starting position. We've stacked him here, we've got it shelved, we're holding behind the back here. My knee's turned in, my foot's planted here. So if I want to go for a leg drag, what I want to seek to do is pull this leg past my hip. So we want to get this up here, and we need to get it high. If I pull this leg here, but I can't reach into this gap here, I'm not going to be able to consolidate the pass. So this is a pass that quite often guys will actually give you. You know what I mean? Again, they're in a horrible spot. They feel me pulling, they're like, oh, he's moving towards the pass, he's giving it to me here. Thank God. So my goal is to use the top hand to reach for the opposite hip. So I'll show you what I mean by that. We lift this leg, and I'm lifting. I'm trying to drag the leg above my hip. I'm trying to take a grip above Tyler's knee. I'm climbing up his body here, because if he's resisting this pass, I'm not going to... So Tyler's resisting. I'm not going to pull it and get in here. I might pull it up here, but as I go, he might bring it back. So we climb this. I pull it up, I get above the knee, I climb, I'm pulling. I'm careful to what I grab in this particular position here. If we turn the corner a little bit, you can see my right hand has reached this opposite hip here. Once we have that hip, so we'll keep it exact here, we reach that opposite hip, we can then start looking for the pass. So the trick is I try to keep his hips high. If as I grab it, Tyler's hips fall to the floor here, he can frame and make space here. So the key to the leg drag is to keep their hips elevated. Unfortunately for Tyler, it's the keeping stat there. So we've got that hip, we've got the shelf. I start to lift. I lift Tyler's hips up. Tyler's trying to retain guard here. Very easy, very difficult to do. Sometimes we lift him up. We can lift him, obviously, all the way through to turtle. Then we can start looking to attack the back. But Tyler, and this is the key, obviously sometimes the best way to work out the defense is to know how to do it right. So obviously if Tyler, if I'm trying to leg drag Tyler and I need to keep his hips high, his defense is trying to get his hips to the floor. A leg drag where Tyler's hips fall to the floor, he can actually extend that top leg away and he can start to turn the knee back in. And now he's retaining guard, right? So we want to keep his hips elevated. So we're in this leg drag position. We've stacked him up. We've climbed this leg, right? So again, we've shelved him here. We're holding that C-grip. We grab it. This isn't a good pulling grip. This is a good pulling grip. You can see I'm using my wrist. So I pull. This knee is enough reinforcement, right? But if I relax this leg, look at the hips. Even if Tyler's not even consciously doing it, the hips start to fall to the floor. So initially the hand and knee was holding. We need to commit. We need to take some risk. But I'm turning my knee in. Sorry, Tyler. Turn on my knee. We're climbing up. We're climbing up. We reach through. Now I can go back. Tyler's trying to retain guard here. Very difficult here. He basically has two choices here. He could go to turtle. Risk his back being taken. He could go. But I can limit him with my leg drag grip. So it's up to you. If I relax it and Tyler's trying to turtle, he turtles and we have a shoulder to back. I come back a step. But because I have both legs control, he's trying to turtle here. No luck. And we can start to bring our head over their head. Grab either shoulder and pull their hips back down to the floor. So again, that key to the leg drag is we lift up the shelf. We're C-grip stacking, right? So for the sake of Tyler's spine, we're C-grip stacking. I go and make a cupping grip. I pull up. I'm climbing until I can get. And you see how loose I threw my elbow. I reach to that far hip. Now we can go back to the hip. We try to keep their hips elevated. Hips hit the floor. We lose this position. I start to step up. Tyler is trying to turtle, but my elbow is blocking him. I can pull him back or I can let go and take the back. So leg drag is a great option from here. A very high percentage option from the stack. Leg drag is my preference, my first preference from there because we're left with so many options. We're left with total control and we can decide whether we want to take a chance to take the back or we want to secure the pass. But again, remember the methodology is the fatigue. The pass comes second. We don't want to pass a fresh guy so that ultimately we're dealing with someone that's thinking clearly. They're not stressed yet, making intelligent decisions. We want to deal with a guy that's already broken by the time we pass. And we can only do that by putting him in fatiguing, stressful situations that they try to explode out of. Stack, great example of that. Cook him there a while, especially if you don't like that particular training partner. Let's look at a pass I stole from Frank Rosenthal's Instagram. It's a great option from the stack and it comes back to addressing the concept of the hip pocket. It really capitalizes on that. So it's again, that hip pocket is how we control inversions. Obviously if it can be used to prevent inversions, it can be used to re-lower the body that is inverted. But the beauty of this position is the stack, we want them inverted. We want the hips above the head. But when it's time and we want to pass, obviously we want those hips back on the floor. And this is a mechanism to control both hips to actually allow us to consolidate the pass. So this is probably the most brutal one on the deck. So if Tyler's not back for the next instructional, you guys know why, right? He should have negotiated a higher price point for stack passing, I think. Foolish on his part. So when we're in the stack here, I'm going to be reaching through for that hip pocket. So you can see how these play off. They play off each other, right? We go for the leg drag, Tyler resists, we find that space, right? If Tyler keeps his knee close to his chest, close to this side, it's hard for me to find it, right? So we pretend one way, he rips it back, he's powerful, we get in there the other way, right? So now what we're going to do is I want to switch staples, right? This pass is going to involve both arms doing what my right arm's doing. But there's no space here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my shoulder to lift that knee-side leg off the ground. I was stapling it, so I obviously have to take weight off of it. But I'm not allowing his leg free reign. It's still a stapled hook. So when we roll through, I'm going to use my left foot. We're going to do it with a windshield wiper motion here to replace my right. See, again, sorry, Tyler. And what we're going to do with that left foot is extend away to make space for our left hand. Now we're controlling both sides of the hip pocket, I can push through and consolidate that pass here, right? So it's sort of an ingenious way to control both sides of the hip pocket. So we go to the stack, we reach through to control one hip pocket, windshield wiper, and that second left hook gives us the space to control both hips. So we're in our stack, we're in our base position here. I'm like, oh, let's go for the leg drag. Tyler resists, so we follow it up by throwing this hand in. Again, hip pocket, right? We want to create elevation on Tyler's left leg while keeping staple control. So I lift that leg and I'm going to replace it with my left foot. Now once we've replaced it with the left, we use the left foot to open up to make space for our left hand. So if you have to, when you're here, rest your right elbow on the floor, we let go with the right foot, left foot's replaced it, we stretch it out, right? Tyler's keeping his knee tight here. His knee's tight to his body. I can't find the gap I'm looking for. That's why we've used this second staple to make space to knock him down here. You can see how my shoulder is in the hip pocket. Tyler's trying to invert. The shoulder is what's controlling him here. So we'll do this one one more time for the sake of Tyler's 45 year old spine. We go for that leg drag, he's resisting, which gives us space to control his hip pocket. We do that pass off by elevating. He's on his left knee. We want both knees floating. My left foot replaces my right foot. I extend my left leg to make space so that my right hand, so my left hand can mimic my right hand. There's no space here, that's why we use the hook. And we use our shoulder to get those hips back to the floor here. So we've got about 27 more passes from the stack position. So we might have to bring Bassano back in. That's an excellent way to follow some of the concepts of controlling the hip pocket that we can find a new way to pass from the stack. And really it is a safe way to pass. And again, it still punishes them for having allowed you to put them in that position. Let's look at one more option from the stack. It's a grip that's going to come up later in this instructional too. It's called the hip drag. Basically we're doing the hip pocket control. We can pocket it, we can drag it. Neil Melanson says he can control any man by his arsehole. I tend to agree with that. But I think we can also control any guard through the hip. We'll test both theories right now. So we're in our stack position here, right? Almost dropped my knee on his head. So again, we still need to get in this pocket for the hip drag, but obviously a good way to set it up is to threaten the leg drag. As they rip it back, they overcommit, leaving space in here. So I'm really threatening the leg drag and we get the hip control. Earlier we controlled the lat. We're still in this pocketed section here, right? But this time I'm going to grab the hip. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull that hip past, right? And we can sort of create the same style. And we can really even transition to a leg drag here, right? But we can even go straight to the pass here. So I can look at the frame exactly the same way, keep his hip past until it's time. Let's try a few different angles here. I reach through for this hip. We can't find the space. Again, threaten the leg drag. They overcommit. We grab that hip. We stand up and I keep his hips elevated here. Tyler's trying to retain guard, he's trying to move here. Very difficult. We reach for anything on his upper body, get our head back inside and pull those hips to the floor here. We threaten that drag, right? He rips it back. We get our arm, our hip drag. Tyler's trying to, look at this, Tyler tries to pull his hips towards his right. We've got complete control here. I'm basically pinching between my hand and my shoulder here, so we've trapped that. And again, we could lift it, we could reinforce it, go straight for the drag. So you do have dragging options from here. Again, great way to take the back. But we could go straight for the pass. We need something controlling the upper body. Inside shoulder, far shoulder. We could even stack. We can even control the neck here. So Tyler tries the turtle. This is going to prevent it here. So again, we've got that hip dragging option, right? That's going to come up a ton throughout the instructional. I truly believe that's our pathway to control and pass is we penetrate that pocket there. We can penetrate it with our feet as I'll demonstrate in a follow-up section. Or if we can control it with our hands. We have the ability to frame and block inversions. We have the ability to pull through inversions here. So I call it the hip drag and that control point is in the hip pocket.
