 What's up guys, we are here again with BJ Fnaggs and Little Miss Sunny and big news, the uh, this is the first instructional we're shooting when Sunny has a round belt. Yay! Can you put the like, the little cellos, hey! So tell them how do you feel? Oh I feel great. Thank you, thank you. And for Sunny. Um, alright so we're going to be looking at strangle escapes today and understand that strangle escapes are going to be categorized into two general groups. We have strangles with the upper body and strangles with the lower body. So obviously, looking at upper body strangles like guillotines, tarses, kakatames, things like that, and lower body strangles like the five triangle groups which we will run through. Alright, but just as a general, just generally categorizing them, we have strangles with the legs and we have strangles with the arms. Okay? Now when we're talking about strangle escapes, understand that they're very different than joint locks. With joint locks, you theoretically have an endless amount of time to fight your way out of this mission. Okay? So that's the X factor, and if you're in an arm bar or a heel hook, whatever the case is, you theoretically can just let your arm or your leg break and then continue fighting to a submission. With strangle holds, this isn't the case. Okay? You have roughly five to eight seconds to fight out before you're unconscious and the match or the fight is over. Okay? So understand that time is always going to be the biggest X factor here. With an arm bar, your arm breaks, you just fight your way out, and maybe you can't continue but you at least get out of the submission and you can use time to work towards an escape. Whereas with a strangle, if it's on tight, you have a few seconds and then that's it. The fight's over. Okay? So with that being said, understand the best strategy for strangle escapes is to recognize danger early and fight out of the position before you get too deep where now you're actually getting strangled and you're about to go unconscious. All right? So recognizing the danger early is going to be a big part of this and going into early escapes and just recognizing danger before the submission's even on and going to escapes. All right? Also understand that because of the fact that you have a limited amount of time, I'm going to give you the best possible escapes for these submissions, but understand your submission escape percentage is going to be lower than it normally would be with pin escapes or joint lock escapes because of the fact that you have less time. And there's a lot of things going on. Maybe you're trying to listen to your coach, maybe you can't hear anything, maybe the crowd's going crazy, or maybe you just haven't done it a lot and you're in the gym and you're getting strangled and you're like, man, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking about this escape. And next thing you know, you're already tapping because you're thinking about it and you're just not quick enough. Okay? So understand that these are like, you know, your last ditch efforts to try to escape. But at the end of the day, you are in a Floyd lock strangle and you know, you messed up a few times to get into that position. So we have to kind of take that with a grain of salt and understand that if you have a 50% submission escape rate from here, it's pretty good. If you can let someone lock you in a full triangle and you can get out half the time, you should be very happy with that. Okay? And understand that in order to master submission escapes, whether it be joint locks, whether it be strangles, in order to master these things, you have to also master offense as well. You can't be a master of offense or defense without mastering the other. If I'm looking to go into strangle escapes, joint lock escapes, whatever the case may be, I have to understand the mechanics that my opponent needs to apply in order to actually finish these submissions. And that means you have to be good at offense in order to understand what you're trying to do defensively and what you're trying to stop your opponent from doing offensively. Okay? So you can't be a triangle master without being a defensive master. You can't be an offensive, very good at armbar offense, but also being very good at armbar defense. So you have to master both offense and defense to really call yourself a master of that given position. All right? So this is one half of the puzzle, and then mastering the offense is the second half of the puzzle. And you can't do one without doing the other. With that being said, let's move into the overview and get this ball rolling. All right. So now we're just going to go into a quick overview of how this instructional is going to go, and then we'll get more specific as we go. The first thing we're going to look at is strangles with the legs. Okay? How to escape strangles with the legs. So we're going to go through our five distinct triangle groups, starting with front triangle, Emote Senkaku. All right. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to look at going through and escaping various forms of Emote Senkaku with the front triangle. All right? Then once we go through Emote Senkaku, we're going to go to Hantai Senkaku, the wrong way triangle where we go in and we look to start transitioning our legs, and our partner starts to go in and strangle us and play a dilemma game between Kimura triangle, armbar triangle, things like that. I didn't cover these upper body joint lock escapes because of the fact that I wanted to do the full dilemma in strangle escapes where you have the strangle in and you have the Kimura danger and the armbar danger. So we're going to go through the dilemma game between strangling and joint locking. Okay? So we have Emote Senkaku, Hantai Senkaku. Then we're going to go into Yoko Senkaku where our partner is lying down on her side and we lock Yoko Senkaku, the side triangle, we go into escapes from this position here. Then for example, our partner turns up on top of us and we end up with Gyaku Senkaku, reverse triangle. We have to go into escapes from here. So we have Emote Senkaku, Hantai Senkaku, Yoko Senkaku, Gyaku Senkaku, and finally, last but not least, Oshiro Senkaku where our partner locks up, gets into Oshiro Senkaku, and now from here we have to go into early and late defenses from here. So our five major triangle groups and we have to defend all of them equally as well. Okay? Once we move through triangles, then we're going to start moving into strangles with the arms, upper body strangles. Starting first in front headlock, which is where a lot of the strangles come from here. So you have Guillotines, you have low elbow, you have high elbow, you have arming Guillotines, things like that. We're going to run through all the Guillotines. Then we'll look at Seoi Karakutame, like so. We'll look at Anaconda, as always. We'll look at D'Arce and we'll start running through situations where we have various strangles from front headlock and we go into defend from there. Then we'll have our partner belly up. We'll look at our Karakutames from mount, for example, from side control, where a partner isolates an arm, isolates the head, and goes into Karakutame and starts locking and finishing from that position. Once we go through Karakutame, then we'll go into north-south where a partner goes in, tries to go through north-south triangles and finishes from there. And then last but not least, we'll move to a back crucifix where a partner has one or both of our arms strapped in various configurations and is trying to strangle us from here. That's the general overview. The one thing we're not going to be looking at today, and this is because I already covered it in detail in back escapes, is rear naked strangles. Because of the fact that there's such a huge portion of back escapes covering rear naked strangle defenses, and I talked about it with different leg configurations and different upper body gripping configurations, I'm not going to spend hours on it here because I already talked about it in detail in back escapes. So if you're looking for rear naked strangle escapes, just reference back escapes and it'll all be in there. All right, that's just a general overview of how we're going to go today. We're starting with leg strangles, triangles, the five triangles, and we're going to go into upper body strangles with the arms, starting with front headlock and then progressing from there. What? What do you have in there? What do you have in your mouth? Nothing. Open it. Nothing. A little watermelon, right? Sour watermelon. All right, so now we're looking at stages of escapes. So when you're actually in the submission, you have early and late escapes. For example, if the triangle's actually locked, you have an early escape where you're not actually getting strangled. The lock may be applied, but you're not actually in danger of having to tap or being strangled unconscious. So this is technically you're still in an early stage of escape here. Now when the triangle's locked, for example, and you're in a fully locked strangle, now this is going into late escapes where you're going to get strangled unconscious if you don't do anything. All right, just like we talked about with upper body joint lock escapes, if you're in an arm bar from here and the hands are locked and the arm's not extended beyond 90 degrees, you're in an early escape. But now when the arm gets extended beyond 90 degrees, now your arm is legitimately in danger of being broken. Now you're in a late escape. So when you're actually in the submission, there's early escapes and there's late escapes. Now if you look at the moves as a whole, there is a setup element to this whole thing where you as the defensive player, you have a responsibility to recognize danger before it happens. So for example, if I'm looking at Yoko Sankaku, for example, and my partner's down on her hips or down on her side, from here I'm looking for Yoko Sankaku. Before the triangle's even applied, my partner knows if she has her hands locked here, there's no Kimura danger. And from here, if I can step between her elbow and her rib cage, Yoko Sankaku is coming. So you can avoid this and not have the triangle set up in the first place at all by just keeping the elbow pinched. So now I can exploit the space and gain that inside position with my heel. And before the triangle is even locked or the submission is even locked, you can recognize the danger before it happens and you can go into the earliest defense, which is not even getting into the submission in the first place. So when you're looking at these submissions, you have early escapes, which is just recognizing and avoiding danger altogether so your partner can't even set the submission up. So we're going to look at a few of these early, early escapes. Of course, there's a million different setups that we can look at for each of these submissions, so we're not going to spend 100 hours looking at every single setup. I probably couldn't even, I would forget about a lot of them if I tried to even remember them. We're not going to spend hundreds of hours in this instruction looking at every single triangle setup, but we're going to look at some of the few major setups and look at recognizing danger early and going in for earliest escapes by just recognizing the danger and not allowing our partner to even lock their triangle to begin with. So then once we're actually in the triangle, we have early escapes when the triangle is locked and not being applied. We have late escapes when we're actually getting strangled and now it's either time to tap or work your way into a late escape and get out. So you have early escapes, which is recognizing danger. You have mid-level escapes where you're not being strangled, but you're in a triangle. Then you have late escapes where now you're in real jeopardy of being strangled unconscious or having to tap. So now let's look at some early escapes from a front triangle, just recognizing danger and escaping or just not even escaping, not even allowing your partner to actually lock the triangle. Again, there's so many setups. We're going to go over some of the most common ones, which usually ends up with someone attacking you from a closed guard type scenario. So my partner is going to have me in closed guard and be looking to set up triangles, however it may be, just looking at ways that we can pressure into our partner, switch, change position and stop my partner from locking triangles altogether. So whenever we're in closed guard, my partner is usually going to have some kind of overhook and some kind of risk control, however it may be. And again, many different variations of this, but this is the general idea here, where she controls one arm and she controls the second arm and she tries to stuff it, whether she stuffs it in like so here, or whether she uses an inside wrist grip like so and looks to start coming out. Whatever the case is, she's going to look to clear one of my arms so that she can go into a triangle. Whenever I see my partner is looking to overhook an arm like so and control this wrist, if I see my partner has an outside wrist grip like so, all I have to do from here is just connect my knee and my elbow to stop my partner from shoving my hand down. What I can't have is this lack of knee-elbow connection, where now my partner can exploit the space between my knee and my elbow to bring her knee up and push my hand down, and from here go in and start putting triangles in place. So whenever I see my partner is looking to change the angles of her hips, looking to move out and away, looking to pull her leg up, the second I see an outside wrist grip, I just connect my own elbow to my knee, and now my partner goes to move from here, and it's just not going to happen. Now I don't want her shifting her hips out, so I just connect my opposite elbow to my knee on this side, and now my partner goes to move her hips around, go for triangles, arm bars, whatever the case is, go for back kicks, it's just not going to happen from here. So whenever I see an outside wrist grip being utilized, we just go in and then we connect our knees and our elbows, and then we lift to pummel our hands through, lift to pummel our hand out, and we get back to position, and now we're ready to go in with our inside bicep ties or V-grips and stand up and get to vertical posture. Whenever I see my partner trying to stuff hands down, just focus on connecting elbows like so. If my partner uses an inside wrist grip, like so, and starts to give me trouble, now it's hard for me to connect my knee and my elbow because of the fact that she has an inside wrist grip. So when I go to connect my knee and my elbow, she shrinks away and starts to give me problems from here. This is no good. Whenever I see this, I can either one, look to take this hand completely out and away, which if my partner is good, she can pull her knee up and start to lock in triangles as I go, like so, so if you feel like your partner is good, I wouldn't recommend that unless you're looking for a secondary escape, which we'll look at in a second, but if I see this and my partner looking to start moving out and away, I'm just going to look to start pressuring forward towards my partner, like so. So now, my partner goes to throw the legs up, I'm pressuring too far into her to actually trap just my head and my arm. If I move back and I try to pull away, this will give my partner the ability to lock triangles. My whole thing from here is I just go and I start pressuring forward, like so. My partner goes to lock triangle now, it's going to be hard. My head is so far forward that she can't get her leg up and over my shoulder, even if she stuffs my hand. When she goes to put her leg up and over my shoulder, I just come in and I just drive forward until I can pull my hand free and get back into position and now I'm ready to work. So whenever I see my partner utilizing inside wrist grip, I can start driving forward in hopes that my partner can't get her leg up and over my shoulder and we can start pummeling hands from there. There's always going to be a time where she uses some kind of inside wrist grip and I feel her leg coming up and I feel like, oh man, this is no good. Now, because the legs are already coming up, there's no reason why I can't just pummel my hand out regardless. So either I do it before, go back, either I do it before the leg comes up and she brings the leg up and I say, oh man, this is no good, or as she's bringing the leg up, I say I'm going to get caught regardless, so I'll just move my hand out and away. And now from here, she goes to throw her leg over and I just take my hand and I just thumb post it like so. Now from here, when she goes to actually lock, she catches my arm, but my head moves out and away. And now she has access to arm bars, omoplatas, kimuras, things like that, and now we're into upper body joint lock escapes rather than strangle escapes. But she doesn't have the ability to actually lock a triangle and control my head and my arm. I'd rather give my arm than my head and my arm and have her lock a triangle and play a dilemma game. Right now, she only has access to the arm and that's okay. So whenever I see triangles coming on, whether it be with an inside wrist grip, whether it be with an outside wrist grip, doesn't make a difference. I see the legs coming up, I just shrug my shoulders and I thumb post like so. So when she goes to form that connection, I just move my head outside her knee and now from here, she only has access to the arm, which is much better than her having access to the head and the arm. So we can play a game where we either pressure too far into our opponent, where she goes to lock up with an outside wrist grip or inside wrist grip, whatever the case is, and I'm just pressuring towards my opponent with knees and elbows connected, making it hard for her to move the hips and bring the legs up. Okay? If at any case, even with an outside wrist grip, she goes to stuff my hand down, she goes to stuff it and throw her legs up, we can thumb post and catch and just take our head to the outside. If I see some kind of inside wrist grip from here, she goes to start taking her legs up and make it hard to go to throw your leg over my shoulder, not easy from here. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's definitely not easy from here. And for whatever reason, if I do see even from here, I get a pressure from what she does get her leg up and over, we just thumb post and we intercept. So when she goes to actually lock her legs, you just take our head outside the knee and now from here, we're ready to work into escapes from omoplatas, quimoras, arm bars, things like that. Okay? So just some basic escapes, recognizing the danger, pressuring forward into my partner, protecting knees and elbows and looking at some of those basic escapes and recognizing danger before my partner can actually lock the triangle. And again, a million different setups here, but we're going to be focused mainly on the escapes from this triangle themselves. But I wanted to just give you guys a little bit extra and show you some of the major setups for these triangles and work through the early defenses. All right, so now my opponent has a trap triangle and is looking to move into triangles and we have to look at early escapes now. So we're actually in the triangle. So once my partner first puts me in the triangle, my first thing is before she gets a strong lock of the ankles, I'm always looking to posture up and away. So as the triangle is coming into place, I'm always looking to posture up and away, but hands on hips like so, or a cross frame, start posturing up like so. So now when she goes to pull me in and tries to break my posture, get to my head, I'm always looking to posture up and away and separate those legs. So the second the triangle is being locked, we go in, we use either a cross frame like so, or we can use two hands on the hips. Usually for close, a cross frame is better. Usually for a little further, two hands on the hips is better. And if my partner goes to take collar ties on me, I can't posture out of the collar tie. So I strip the collar tie first, then we cross frame and we look to walk our shoulders up. So our hips come in forward, we just posture up like so. So we walk one, two, three, four. We come in here, she goes to lock up, we go cross frame like so, we reinforce the hand. If she has no collar tie, we just posture. She takes a strong collar tie, we strip the collar tie. If she takes the opposite hand collar tie, now we have to switch hands like so. We strip the collar tie. Now we can go double cross frame, we can go double hip post, we can use various post from here. So she goes to pull me in and now we start posturing. She can switch collar ties. We go in clear one, I posture, she takes a second one. We have to go back and forth. As she goes to keep switching collar ties, she goes to pull the knees in and we look into posture. And from here, we just walk. The whole thing is I walk my shoulders. One, two, three, four. The shoulders go forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards. So she goes to hold on, we separate like so. Once we separate our whole thing from here, we don't want to get pulled back in. So we take our hand that was trapped, we pull our elbow to our own hip and we insert our knee. And now from here, we've counterattacked into our partner's legs, guard passes, wherever you want from there. So we go in, she locks up, we take cross post. From this position, we have to clear collar ties if they're there. If they're not, then we just posture. If she has a collar tie, we clear collar ties like so and now we begin to posture. The closer our knees are towards our partner, the easier it is for us to drive our hips forward and posture up and out and away. So we can posture up and out and away. Now let's say for whatever reason, from here, our partner starts to pull us in, takes a strong collar tie, and I'm like, man, I can't posture out from here. Whenever I see this, we take a V grip inside of our partner's thigh like so. She goes to pull me in. From here, I just move my shoulder inside my partner's thigh and knee. So as she goes to pull her knees in, she goes to pinch her knees together, we just take the shoulder inside. Even when she goes to lock up tight and she pinches her knees strong, I can take the shoulder inside to some degree. It won't separate her legs, it won't get your shoulder completely inside, but it'll do a little bit of the work. So when she goes to pinch her knees tight, you just take the shoulder inside. Now from here, we take our hand inside like so. And now from here, the shoulders inside, we just walk. One, two, three. And we just like to bring the shoulder back inside. Now from here, we either have a choice of taking a hand through or we have the choice of locking hands, opening the elbow, and clearing the head. Okay? So we go in, she locks up, we take a thumb post in like so. We put our elbow inside of our own knee. And now from here, she goes to pull her knees to her chest, she takes a strong collar ties, I can't beat her from here. We go in, shoulder comes in. From here, hand comes in. And now from here, we either one, look to start going in and punching that shoulder through. So she goes to pull me in and I just walk forward. And I start punching my shoulder forward until we can either one, take the hand through, or two, from here, open the elbow up to my partner's knee, she goes to maintain the triangle. We shrug the shoulders, head comes out, and we're out and away. So if we can't posture out and away, like so, we start pressuring forward. She goes to start controlling me, goes to start making transitions to finish. We take everything to the inside position, like so. Once we're inside, we either free the head or we punch the shoulder forward, elbow follows, now we're back inside of our partner's guard like so. So we play a game, we're first and always, we try to posture. So the second she goes to lock immediately, I suck her hips on top of mine, and immediately I'm posturing. You can't posture if your knees are far away from your partner. She goes to pull me in from here, never going to pick anything up from here. The first thing is, knees come forward, pull my partner's hips up. Now when she goes to pull me in, it's going to be hard. Now she's doing such a good job with the knee pull, on the collarties, I can't beat her from here. Whenever I see this, we just go in, we start pressuring to one side. When she goes to start adjusting, we just move the shoulder slightly inside our partner's knees. Now from here, we take a hand to the inside position. And she goes to start moving around from here, I have the choice of either one, taking the head out and away. You want to use your knee to assist, you can always do that as well. Or from here, if I feel like I can't take the head out, the head coming out is usually the easiest one, if I feel like the head can't come out from here. But if for whatever reason I'm too deep into the triangle, she goes to lock up and stay over the shoulder, and it's just about stepping the leg up and driving our shoulder forward like so. She goes to lock up tight, tight, tight. You just punch your shoulder forward, and the elbow comes forward. Now we're in, back to closed guard, ready to go in. And finally, she locks up. Right away, I feel like I'm just going to immediately try not to posture, I feel like the posture's not going to work. I feel like from here, I'm not going to be able to drive forward. Whatever the case is, we take our thumb and we just thumb post. And now from here, we step the leg up. From here, as we step the leg up, she goes to start pulling me in. I just shrug my shoulders, and I just thumb post out. Right, punch, punch, punch, punch, almost like a kipping motion. One, two, three, four. I shrug my shoulders, and we walk our head free. So we go in, she locks up, we start circling. We just thumb post right in the hamstring, and now we're out and away with our third early escape. So the second she goes to lock up, we post. Now we start circling. She goes to pull me in, finish. Now we're out and away, ready to go to all of our counterattacks. So first one, she locks up. Immediately, I'm here. We can posture out. This time she pulls me in too deep. We thumb post inside the thigh. Shoulder comes inside, we block the hand. And now from here, we lift it free, ourselves out and away. And third one, you can also use this as a pretty early escape. For the second she goes to lock up, we thumb post. We start circling out, create an angle, slip the head free. So now she only has the arm, not the head and the arm. All right, so now we're actually in a late defense to a triangle where she actually has a triangle locked. The first thing I'm going to ask myself is where is my arm? Is my arm on one side or is it across the body? So we'll start in our best case scenario, and then we'll work across to the worst case scenario. In general, when I have the hand on the correct side of the body for when I want it, a step over method is pretty easy. So she has a fully locked triangle. We're just going to have her with a not fully figure four triangle because it's going to be so tight I won't be able to talk. But just imagine she has a fully locked triangle. From here, she locks up a full triangle. From here, we put a V grip on our partner's arm like so, and we just step our left leg up. So when she goes to create an angle to try to scoop my opposite leg, it's not going to be an easy thing to do from here. What she wants to do is she wants to scoop this leg like so and create an angle. So I put a wedge on this hip with my right elbow. I wedge the hip in place and I reinforce that with my knee and I step my left leg back. So when she goes to move her hip out to the right to create that angle, it's going to be a difficult thing to do. Not impossible, but difficult. Now from here, we're going to put two hands in our partner's armpit and we're going to stand up. And that whether your arm's here or whether it's here, you can perform the step over method, but it's much harder to do and she has much higher success rate when the arm is here. And we'll look at that in a second. So from here, we go in, we put our hand as a V grip in place, we put a hand as a V grip in place, and now we stand up like so. And we don't want her scooping our leg and creating an angle. So we immediately sit down. If I sit down with my butt too close to my partner's hips, she will always be able to pull her knees to her chest, make it impossible for me to throw my legs over because there's too much weight on my legs to actually get them over my partner's torso. Okay? So you have to make sure your butt is as far away from your partner's as possible. So we stand up, we sag our butts back and away like so, and we sit into this position here. Once we have our hips in this position, it's the easiest thing now to start casting legs up and over my partner's body. So when she goes to pull her knees into her chest, I throw one leg over where I put two feet in the armpits. And now from here, I start extending back and away. So either go one leg first, then you can cross the second leg, you can go figure four, figure four is actually the strongest. And now from here, when she has to pull her knees to her chest, we just place two hands on. So the first thing is we have hands in our partner's armpits like so, we either stay here, we post the chest. Now from here, we start leaning out towards the side of the arm that's trapped, we throw a leg. Once we have a leg in place, we throw a second leg. And now from here, she has to pull her knees in with your shoulder walk, one, two, three, four. So we separate those legs and we're out and away, ready to counterattack. Okay, so we go in, she locks up. First thing is, deny the angle by covering the hips. We cover the hip with the elbow, we V-grip, and we reinforce that wedge with our knee. So now from here, when she goes to make that angle, she can't move her hips, she runs into a second V-grip and it's hard for her to work from here. We stand up. As we stand up, it's a quick stand up and we sit back right away so she can't scoop our leg and create the angle. Stand up, I sit back with my butt far out and away. Here. If I'm here, especially if the triangle's locked, she pulls her knees in, there's too much weight on my legs. So when I stand up, I sit back and away, as always, I sag far out and away. Now from here, I lean to a side. My feet either come to my partner's armpits or better over the torso here. Or best of all, if you get a full figure four. You always better do this though. If your partner's bigger than you, your legs are shorter, whatever the case is, it may be difficult. Whatever we're looking for is some kind of separation between my partner's body and ours. She goes to pull her knees to her chest now. We just push, walk, one, two, three, four. We separate and from here, we're in, ready to go into all of our counterattacks with submissions or otherwise. So one more time. This time, I won't talk through it because I'm going to be getting strangled. I'll just do the full thing when she has a full figure of four. She actually locks her legs in a figure four and I'll go into the full escape with the hand on my correct side. She's obviously trying to pass the arm across the body, the elbow across the center line. I want the hand on the opposite side so she can't put a strong strangle in place. She goes in. First thing is, she locks up a strangle. She gets it all the way in tight. Lock the figure four. She goes to create an angle and we're out and about, ready to go in and counterattack. Okay? So we can use a stepover method. We'll use a stepover method, making sure we stop the initial scoop on the arm and the leg. The leg is, if she scoops the leg, she's going to create an angle. So we shut the angle down with a V-grip, an elbow wedge, and a reinforced knee wedge. This blocks her hips in place. Then I stand up and I quickly, I don't want to scoop the legs. I don't just stand up and stay there. I stand up, I sag my hips back and away, I sit far and away. That gives me the ability to create weightless legs, cast my legs over, and shoulder walk one, two, three, four, five until my partner's ankles separate, her figure four is unlocked, and then from there we can go in and counterattack however we want or just go in, get top position and start passing again. All right, so now we can do the stepover method if your arm gets passed across. I'm not saying you can't do that. But understand you are deeper into the strangle now because the arm's across. It's probably better to go into a knee pull method. But if your arm is across, you can go into the stepover method. Then as you're stepping over, you can look to bring your elbow back across or at least to the center of the chest and then push away, throw the legs over and defend. Let's look at a knee pull method now where a partner actually passes our arm across and we have to pull the knee down to separate the triangle. So we go in, she locks up, but she pulls the arm across and actually locks up a triangle. From this position, I find that, man, I'm going to get strangled from here. I'm in a real late defense. My elbow's across center line. Whenever I see this, I'm just going to reach up and I take a grip here, I'm as deep as I can on my partner's knee, I just reinforce it with my second hand. So my left hand, my free hand grabs like so. I open up my jaw so I can expose that knee, that hamstring tendon if I can. Then we go in and reinforce here. From here, my whole thing is to punch my right shoulder inside the strangle here. My right shoulder must come inside the strangle in order for this to work. So I come up off my knees, she goes to lock up, and as I go to drive forward, my intention is to turn in this direction with my head. The directionality of force is my head coming out and away as my right shoulder punches through here. So when she goes to lock up tight, she locks a full figure four, she passes the hand across. From here, my whole thing is I drive forward first and then I punch the shoulder through and I create that separation with the figure four. Right from here, hand comes inside, hands lock. Now when she goes to relock, hands are in, but it's her legs versus my hands. This is no good. So right from here, knee comes inside. Now I have a knee-elbow connection. She goes to lock up now. Now it's my hands and my leg versus her legs, and we win that battle every time. So from here, she locks up a triangle. Now she has a triangle. We can stand up. We can be up here. We can stand up and try to sit over, but you're running out of time here. Our time is always the X factor. So from here, the second the hand goes across, immediately we catch. One, two. She locks up a tight triangle. I come up off of my knees, two feet driving into my partner, and now I quickly whip my head down, punch the shoulder forward. Hand comes inside. We lock. She goes to relock. Again, it's my hands versus her legs, and she's probably using her hands to try to separate my hands from here. So I have to quickly get my knee into the equation. Now even if she separates, it doesn't matter. I have that knee inside. If the knee's not inside and she separates, she collapses my hand. No good. The knee's inside. It's an extra wedge. She goes to beat me from here. I can always separate, and now we're back on the attack ready to go. So we can do the step over method from here, but understand you're running out of time. You're getting strangled, and once the hand comes across, what I generally recommend is the second the hand comes across, just go right into this method. So we're here. She locks a full figure four. Brings the hips up, passes the hand across, and we're out. Hand comes in. She goes to relock, and now we're out and away. This is just a quicker method to get to an escape because you are getting strangled now. So you can do the step over method, but it takes three, four, five extra seconds to stand up and throw the legs over, and sometimes you don't have that amount of time. But a lot of times it's better to just use the knee pull method. Go in, shoot the shoulder forward, separate the triangle, and then work to get your knee inside and eventually free yourself altogether from the strangle. All right, so this time our partner takes the elbow across. We attempt to do the knee pull method, but our partner grabs her own shin. That means it's impossible to separate the triangle, and you're still getting strangled. This is kind of like a last-ditch effort where I'm like, okay, man, I have a few seconds. Let me try to roll to mount. All right, so basically what will happen here is we have a triangle, other side. We have a triangle, and we pass the arm across. She attempts to do the knee pull method, which if my hands are doing something else, that knee pull method will separate the triangle. But if I have a hand assist and she goes through that same knee pull method, she can't separate the triangle because I'm physically grabbing my own leg. And the whole time from here, you're potentially getting strangled and finished. Now, the idea behind rolling to mount is that you can shoulder walk backwards. The reason why you can do this when you're in bottom position, not when you're in top position, is because when you roll to mount, your opponent's legs now are wedged against the floor. Here, they're floating freely in the air. So if she has to shoulder walk or punch her shoulder forward or do any kind of that now, it's impossible because the legs just move with you. When you roll to bottom mount and you start bridging along the floor, her legs are wedged against the floor and it makes it easier for you to shoot your shoulder inside that strangle and then pop out and end up in bottom mount. But it's better than having the match finish all together. Whenever I see her try this knee pull method, she grabs her own shin and I feel like I can't separate the figure four. Whenever I see this, I pull my partner up on top of me like so and now I can start bridging and walking my shoulders backwards. The reason why this works is because now her right leg is wedged against the floor. Her right leg is wedged against the floor. So when she goes to keep that triangle locked, she can't follow me with the right leg. And now I just focus on shooting my right shoulder forward first and pulling the elbow down. Now from here, once the right shoulder is shot forward, the figure four is starting to separate. Now my whole thing from here is getting my left shoulder inside the knee. So I start walking at a slight angle over my right shoulder. Left shoulder comes forward. Right shoulder comes forward. Left shoulder comes forward. And now we're out at a slight angle. We're in bottom mount. Hands come inside and we're ready to escape. Okay? So the idea behind this is that you put weight over your partner's legs and then your body movement will separate the legs by wedging her leg in place and shoulder walking up. So you feel, you try to step over method and it's just, you're not going to have enough time and things are happening fast here. You have five seconds, maybe 10 seconds to work, but it's starting to go south. You have your hand in place. She passes the arm across. I'm three seconds in now. I try to do a knee pull method. Now I'm like, oh man, lights are going off. I got to do something. Hold the bottom mount, try to shoulder walk by first punching the shoulder through and then one, two, three, four, walk along the mat at an angle before she can follow or and she won't be able to follow. So we go in here. Look at this. It's no good. She passes the arm across. This is worse. Figure four comes in tight. This is real bad. I tried the knee pull method. Fail there. I'm like, oh man, this is no good. We quickly whip ourselves to bottom mount like so. And now from here, the whole thing from this position is just, just use, even if she has her, even if she's grabbing her own shin like so, because her leg is wedged in place. It's my body versus the grip of her legs and her hand. So a lot of times from here, she goes to lock up tight. I just punched that first shoulder through and I pull my right hand down. When she goes to hold on tight, it's hard. Now from here, I have to move my body like so. I just walk left shoulder in, right shoulder, left shoulder, right shoulder, and we're out. What does it look like? A little bit more live context. She's going to lock up. She's going to hold a relatively tight grip with her hand on her own shin. I'm trying to knee pull method. Fails. Right from here, the second I see this, we immediately fall. She goes to hold on and we just walk the shoulders. It's not going to look pretty. You're going to end up in bottom mount, but you're not going to get strangled unconscious or have to tap right away. All right? We roll to bottom mount. We wedge our partner's legs in place and then from there, we just walk, walk, walk, walk, walk at a slight angle, get both shoulders inside, and we finish with good defensive hands, however it may be, in bottom mount. All right, so now let's say this time, maybe my partner sets up a triangle from mount or I roll from top position to bottom mount. I don't free myself from the triangle. You don't want to stay in the mounted triangle if you don't hit the initial escape. If you're in bottom position and you're mounted and you don't initially immediately roll to bottom position and then break your partner's triangle open, you do not want to stay in a bottom mounted position. You want to go back to top. Maybe you loosen the triangle a little bit by rolling to bottom, then you roll right back to top, and then you go through your previous escapes. Okay? So maybe the roll loosens it, but doesn't get you out. Or maybe your partner just sets up a mounted triangle from top and you want to put them back to bottom position. But you absolutely don't want to stay in a mounted triangle for any amount of time. So my partner has a mounted triangle, however it may be. Maybe she sets it up from top position and she ends up in a mounted triangle like so. What I want from here is I always want to have this cross frame, which will make it hard for my partner to create an angle. All right? She obviously should have her legs locked, but I don't want to get strangled while I'm trying to talk to you guys. From here, what I'm looking to do with this cross frame is I'm looking to put my partner's hands out on the ground somewhere down by my hips. What I can't have is a situation where her hands are up and above my head and now a bridge or anything has no effect. So what I want to look to do from here is I want to look to use a series of pendulums with my legs and a small push with my right elbow to get my partner basing out over on my left side, my right arm strap. I have my partner basing on the left side and getting her pan posted on the floor like so. So now from here, I can use a hand assist, depending on where my partner's arm is, or a foot assist where my partner's hand is. I just push the hand out as far as I need to to access it with my foot like so. And now once I have access to my partner's wrist with my foot, we just give a quick push. The second we push, we immediately scissor our legs again to top position and now we're ready to go into the same escapes we looked at before. Okay? So the whole thing is to get my partner's hips or hands posted out somewhere by my hips and access that wrist ultimately with the sole of my foot to take her base support out and then to scissor my legs to top position. This is super effective. So from here, she locks up a triangle. From this position, her hands posted above my head mean nothing. The bridge means nothing. It has no effect. So from here, she wants her hands posted above my head. She wants to fight to keep them there. Go ahead. I use a pendulum and a slight lift with my right elbow to get my partner's hand posted down by my hips somewhere. Now from here, I can use either a hand assist or if her hand is out so far where I can immediately access it, I catch it. But a hand assist will always work. I just thumb post and I push it out further than she wanted it to go. We catch like so. Now it doesn't look like much. Again, it's not pretty. You're in a fully locked mounted triangle, but I promise you it works. Now lock up a triangle. What I try to tell you when I say go, try to stay on top. Go. And we're off. And now we can start all of our defenses from top position. It's not going to look pretty again. It's going to be, you may get finished and it's not going to be comfortable, but this is the way to go from a mounted triangle where you have basically, you don't dictate anything to at least top position where you can move your partner around. You can attempt to stand up. You can use other methods of escape and then you can go back and forth. It's playing top position and doing rolls to bottom mount to take some of the heat off, loosen it up and then go back to top position. Okay. Let's try it one more time. She has a triangle lock this time. I'm not going to talk to her because I'm going to be getting strangled, but she locks a full tight figure four. And we're like, man, we're getting strangled from here. Okay. When I see this, I want to have my elbow in position the best I can. If I have to, I lock my hand. If I have to, I thumb post inside the thigh, but I want to be pulling this elbow back the whole time. So it takes pressure off the strangle. She has her hands posted above my head from here. She goes to keep the hands posted above the head, but I changed the angle right from here. We go either one or hand closer to now when she goes to stay on top, the angle is so drastic that when I kick the spaces of port out, a scissoring of my legs becomes easy. The second I kick, watch my legs and now when she goes to get on top, this elbow cracks the hip down and we're up to top position. We're going to start fighting from what probably will be a fully locked triangle, but now you're on top and you have a lot more options than being mounted in a triangle with no ability to do anything. Okay. So this is a way to get your partner to bottom position, assuming you maybe rolled into mount to try to shoulder walk backwards and you couldn't separate your partner's legs or your partner set up a mounted triangle, uh, right from the beginning and you have to get back on top of a top of that. You want their hand posted somewhere down by your hip so you can eat the thumb post and ultimately get the sole of your foot down to their wrist. You push the hand out, which always be easy cause it's your leg pushing their post and then just scissor the legs, crack the hip down, get to top position and fight your fight to work for your escapes from there. So now let's take a look at the triangle armbar dilemma, which is a very good dilemma. I actually, this is how I finished Bo Nickel in our match at third coast. He tried the posture out of the triangle. I put heat on the armbar, he had to pressure back into me and then I ended up blocking the triangle and finishing him. Same thing with Josh Barnett. It's the same way I finished. The triangle wasn't initially locked. He went to go pull out. Armbar came in, he pressured in, triangle was locked and then he was finished. Okay. So the basic dilemma here is your partner, either one, you don't have the triangle fully locked and they got to stand up to pressure out. Where from here as they go to posture up or stand up, I put pressure with the armbar and I threatened breaking them. They have to push her back, push her back into me in order to avoid that. And then the triangle locks and you get finished. Okay. Um, that's the general idea here. Um, anytime the head rises and the arm gets extended, we can get breaks. Okay. And then if you have the triangle locked, it can lead into a much tighter triangle when they pressure back into you to avoid getting armlocked. Okay. So let's take a look at how to avoid this. When she has me in a triangle and I start posturing up and she goes to start breaking me, understand she's going to have control over my thumb with one hand if she's good and control of my wrist with the other hand like so. So now as I posture, as I stand, hips will come forward and she'll start going in and she'll start breaking me with Jujitama there. Okay. So the second I start the posture from this position, first of all, when I posture, I start posturing up. I want this, I want this, I want this. There's always a bend in my arm here. As my arm gets elongated, this is past 90 degrees. When I go to posture, this is no good. If your arm is elongated beyond 90 degrees, this is not the time for you to be posturing. Okay. This is time to be pressuring into people. So now I start posturing out of this triangle and for whatever reason, she locks up with the arm bar and now I'm like, oh man, I'm going to get broken from here. Whenever I see this, I want to first come forward. Okay. When I come forward, I have a specific goal here. The more I can get my partner's hips over her shoulders, the less pressure the Jujitsu is going to have. If I just drive forward towards my partner's head like so, and she locks up a triangle like that and extends, I'm going to get broken. But from here, if I can first pull my partner in towards me and now drive forward with the intention of driving my hips forward and putting her shoulders above her hips, when she goes to throw her hips in now and break me, you see how much less extension there is from here? It's much different than just arbitrarily driving forward towards the head. If I do that, extend, this happens. But from here, if I pull her in towards me and now my hips, not just my head, drive forward. If my hips come forward with my head, I step a leg up like so. So she's attacking my right arm. My right leg goes up. She goes to break me. It's not going to happen from here. In addition to this, I want to catch the hand that is controlling the long end of the lever and the position of my thumb, her right hand. Okay? She will always have a grip, regardless of the arm bar, like a grip where you're saying, what's up to your buddy? Here. This is a preferred great breaking grip. Then when she locks up, she has one hand here, one hand on my wrist. I immediately catch that hand. This has two purposes. One, to free my thumb so I can move. Two, to stop her from scooping my leg and transitioning to a tighter triangle when I finish dealing with the juji. So I go in here. Now I start posturing up. Whatever reason, she goes to extend me. You can lock the loose triangle. From here, I go to start posturing up. The first thing is I pull her in towards me. Now, head coming forward will lead to this. Extend. Hips and head simultaneously coming forward will lead to this. And now from here, we strip. She goes to grab my leg now with a scoop grip. The inside wrist grip prevents this. And now from here, because the hips are directly over the shoulders, many times if you thrust forward just enough, your partner will end up letting go. This is a very common reaction. You don't see it too often because the way the guys posture forward into triangles is incorrect. If you do it right, this is going to happen. At the bare minimum, what's going to happen is from here, we pull everything in. We pressure forward. And now the juji is released. Now from here, I can crowd the head. We can relock our hands, whether it be figure four, whether it be palm to palm, whatever the case may be. And now from here, we can go back in. We're out of the juji danger. We go back into dealing with the triangle, whether it be standing up right away, whether it be going back down to your knees, whatever you want from there. It doesn't make a difference as long as you're not getting your arm broken right away. So she locks up full triangle. She goes to extend my hand. If I just go in and I drive right towards the head with my head, extend, this happens every time. So the first thing is she goes to extend me. I pull everything in. Now hips and head come forward. She goes to extend. Many times, hips come forward enough or you're out and away. And trust me, do this correctly. It'll work on people any size, not just because I'm bigger than her that I'm just muscling my way out. It doesn't have anything to do with it, despite what Reddit says. At the bare minimum, we go in. And from here, we can crowd the head. She goes to extend me with one arm. It won't happen. She can't control my thumb and my elbow a lot because she doesn't have this grip anymore. She goes to control my thumb. As I turn the thumb, my elbow comes back. We lock our hands and then we can go and cue any one of our defenses right from there. We can throw legs over. We can do knee pull methods depending on if she passes the arm across or not. We have a variety of defenses there. But understand that the arm bar is a real danger there. You can get broken. You have to be able to deal with this accordingly as your partner starts to thrust the hips forward, not panicking, coming forward with the head and the hips, monitoring that hand, and then either locking hands or separating the triangle altogether with the hips coming forward. All right, so now let's talk endgame. So basically, you're fighting to do all these escapes and you're trying to work through which one is best and when and why before your opponent gets to a situation where they can strangle you or they can break your arm and you have to tap. It's a very tough situation. You're going to be doing a lot of thinking and you have, depending on how tight the strangle is, it's only a few seconds to actually react accordingly with defensive reactions. So it's all going to come down to time. Can I step over before my partner strangles me? Can I separate the triangle with a knee pull or a roll to bottom mount before my partner strangles me? Can I start getting my partner's hips up and over their shoulders before my partner strangles me, before my partner starts angling the triangle and turning belly down? Just angle your knees this way. Angling the triangle and turning belly down and starting to push and break me up and over a hip. And can she play combinations of triangle arm bar before or better than I can go into my defenses? So it's all going to come down to time. Can I hit my defenses properly before my partner strangles me unconscious or I have to tap? So the end game here is your ability to chain these defensive movements together better than your partner's ability to hold on, create angular advantage, and chain the offensive attacks between arm bar and triangle together, playing top, playing bottom, and eventually strangle you. So it's all going to come down to time and how you both play offensively and defensively together. Because like I said, with strangles, it's just a time thing. With arm bars and stuff like that, we have end games to an arm break, whether or not you can do this, do this, or do that, and then eventually get broken or you have to tap. But you have unlimited time. With strangles, you don't have unlimited time. So it's all a matter of can I hit these defensive movements in the correct fashion at the correct time before my partner can actually lock it up tight enough to make me tap or strangle my own man.
