 Alright, so now we're going to start moving into North-South escapes. And understand again, one of the easiest times for us to escape these bottom pins is when my partner is making the transition from a side control where she's in a static pin to North-South where she's in a static pin. The intermediary steps between the two positions is usually the easiest time to escape. Alright, so we're going to look at transitions on how we can escape as she's making that transition from side control to North-South and then of course once we're legitimately pinned in North-South. The two things we're going to be looking at is when my partner goes to make a switch to North-South, she can do so in one of two ways. She can use a bottom hand switch first where her underhook hand switches to my near hip like so and then her top hand goes over and she makes a transition. Or she can use a top hand cross face hand switch first where her hand comes over and now from here the underhook hand, the bottom hand moves across to my hip and now she starts circling into a situation where she moves into North-South. And depending on what my partner does and which hand goes first, that's going to determine which set of escapes I use. So now we're going to start looking at escapes as my partner goes to make the transition whether she goes underhook hand first or whether she goes cross face hand first. Let's talk about an opponent who wants to go from side control into North-South and they go with the cross face hand first. The cross face hand comes out and over and goes up and over the shoulder. Now the second I see my partner's hands unlocked, my first thing is to try to clear the cross face with two V-grips and bring my legs back inside. So the second I see I have hands inside, my partner says, okay, the hands are inside and I want to make a transition into a North-South because of the fact that side guard can come into place. If my partner has the total inside position from side control, there's no reason why she would want to go to North-South. She would want to stay in side control and go into attacks or move into mounts. The only reason why she would want to go into a North-South is because she feels the danger of a reed guard coming in or my knees and legs are starting to reentangle her. So the second I see her, I'm going to take her cross face hand and she unlocks her hand and there's no more tension and she goes to take it through. I just bump my partner forward and I just clear the cross face and my head comes underneath my partner's chest. So she goes to pommel the hand around and we just move to this position like we did back at the beginning of the instructional and now as she goes to recover, we just lock the side guard and we bring everything inside. So as she goes to unlock her hands, now there's no connection of the hands anymore, we can easily clear the cross face and bring the legs inside. This is actually pretty common and it looks simple and it is, but if you time it right, it's one of the easiest escapes. Now a second great option is from here, as she goes to take the cross face hand up and over, from here we just go into our tricep pose series where as the hand comes across, she goes to start taking her right hand across and as she goes to do so, we just sit up and we start going into our same series with the tricep pose. Whether it be turning away completely or turning away and then turning back and we can start playing a game there. This time, she goes to take her hand up and over and from here, the hand passes by and now this time instead of sitting up and going into a tricep pose, we just immediately go right into the over back series where I immediately stop her from circling around and getting up and above my shoulder line. As her leg is going to move, I just block the legs with my right elbow and now as she goes to move to north south, we just sit up and we go to this over back series and we start working from here. Whenever I see the hand is unlocked, my opening gambit, very conservative, is just to bump her forward so my hand comes underneath her chin and move back to a side guard and recover. If I feel the hand come over, I have two choices. As the hand comes over, I can turn away from my partner with tricep pose escapes and then go into whatever escapes or over back options or I can skip turning away from my partner and I can just shoot right to an over back grip. I can sit up and I can go right into my options from here and then that leads us into either attacks or recoveries. My partner goes over back or my partner goes cross face hand first. As the cross face hand comes over, the hands are unlocked and as the hands come unlocked, that's usually the easiest time for you to go into your escapes. Now this time, my partner unlocks the hands, she keeps the cross face and she tries to put an under hook hand in place. This time, again, the second my partner's hands come unlocked, my opening gambit is always to attempt, as she goes to unlock the hands, to bump my partner forward and bring the knees in and stop. Now many times this won't work. So from here, this time, she feels like maybe a side guard is coming in so she doesn't take the cross face hand over first. She wants to block my knee from coming in so she slides the elbow across and she blocks my hip. So now there's no ability to lock a side guard. Now understand that yes, you can't lock a side guard, but there's nothing controlling your hips now. She has two of her hands on the same side of your body. Now she'll be trying to take the other hand across, which can happen eventually, but if she goes with the under hook hand first, it's a pretty easy thing from here to just take my knee up to my partner's shoulder and to use my left leg to start scooting away. As I do so, I just use my left hand to lift my partner's head out and over my shoulders so that she no longer has a cross face. So I play a game where I lift and I move into a situation like so. Now I can't insert my knee inside my partner's hip, the hand blocking it. So instead, I make space between my elbow and my partner's shoulder. I just take my knee right up through that hole. And now from here, I go around the arm and when she goes to stop me from connecting knee and elbow, she can't do so, I can switch to an inside bicep tie and now we can bring knees and elbows back together. Now from here, this time we have everything inside, my partner's fearing the side guard, she's fearing an escape. So she says, let me transition to north-south. The second I see that hand go, we immediately start to scoot away. Now your partner knows that as you go to scoot away, she'll be trying to make a transition with her head coming down to your far hip and her blocking you from coming inside. So my whole thing, when she goes to put the underhook hand first, is to get my head underneath her chest. If my partner can get her right ear to my left hip, you won't be able to insert your knee at the shoulder. You're going to get stuck here. So my whole thing is to create an initial kazoo-shi. The second the underhook hand comes in, she wants to be driving her head towards my right hip. I'm going to be bridging and I lift my elbow over my right shoulder. So she wants to go left hip, I want to go right shoulder. When the hand comes into place, she goes to dive towards my left hip, and my knees come inside. This is super, super important. If your partner can put her underhook, take her underhook hand out and cover my hip, if she can get ear to far hip, she wins the battle and now there's no insertion of my right knee anywhere. She can successfully move to north-south. So the second my partner goes to make that transition, I immediately bump my partner so that her head moves over my right shoulder. She wants to go left hip, I want to go right shoulder. So the second she goes to make that transition, we move into a situation like so. And now I just exploit the space between my elbow and her shoulder, and I fire my knee through that hole, and now we take everything back to the inside position like so. So some great options. One of my partner goes underhook hand first and goes to block the hips. It's going to be a race. Can your partner get her ear to your far hip before you can get her head over your far shoulder? All right, so now let's look at a situation where my partner actually makes both of the grip changes and she takes the crossface hand over, she takes the underhook hand through to the hip, and now she starts walking into north-south. How can I initially recover by taking my elbows inside my partner's shoulders and then joining knees and elbows together? So she comes in and she effectively switches her grips like so. Now as she goes to make this transition, again, it's going to be a race of whether or not she can get number one, her ear to your far hip, number two, her head and torso between her two knees. If she can do those two things, now she's effectively moved north-south and you have to look to go into escape from here. All right, so she's in, again, once again, a static position. So as she goes to make that transition, I have my left elbow inside my partner's shoulder. This is where the battle is going to be fought. As she goes to make those grip changes from here, my whole thing is going to be as my partner goes to move, I take my left elbow forward to make it hard for my partner to dive her shoulder and ear to my far hip. So now as she goes to make that transition, I just bump my partner forward and I bring my shoulders off the floor. As she goes to run around, I just take everything inside and I bring my left knee to my left elbow just like so. Now I have one side of the battle won. I have two pieces of inside position. I have the inside elbow and I have the inside knee. From here, she still has the inside shoulder relative to my knee and elbow on this far side. Let's rotate. So from here, I use a lifting action with my left knee. You can actually see this is a perfect example of this. My match against Joao Rocha in the overtime in Kasai 2019. It's not from a pin escape, it's from guard retention using one knee to insert a second knee. From here, I just lift everything like so and I use that as she goes to drive towards me. I use that, I just extend my lower leg of my left leg and I take my foot higher than the height of my knee. So everything moves out and away from my body and I just extend the lower portion of my left leg and as she goes to drive forwards into me, we slide the left knee inside like the left elbow or right elbow rather inside like so. And now as she goes to start putting pressure on me, we just take the right knee inside and now we have everything on the inside position. Once we have our knees and elbows connected, my whole thing is to put my partner back in front of me. So from here, I take a cross post on my partner's hip. I do not sacrifice knee and elbow connection when I do this. I take a cross post on my partner's hip, whether it be here or here and now from here, we use this to start extending my partner into situation where I can put my body back in front of them. So whenever I see we have this knee and elbow connection formed, we take one cross post, we take a post on the outside of my partner's thigh. Now as she goes to follow me and she goes to keep her knees outside my torso with my head between her legs, I just rotate and I extend my body and I put myself back in front of her. As she goes to follow, pretty easy thing to go back into a scissor guard, go back into a butterfly guard and recover some kind of open guard. So my partner tries to move from side control into north-south. It's going to be a battle of shoulder and ear to far hip. If my partner can establish that, you're going to get pinned. If my partner can put my head between their legs, you're going to get pinned. So from here, as she goes to make the transition, my left elbow dominates the inside position relative to her shoulder. She goes to start coming around the corner from here, I lift and I bring knee and elbow together like so. Now she has the right shoulder inside. So from this position, we just extend our knee out and away from us and we lift the foot higher than the height of the knee. So when she goes to put pressure on me, we bring the elbow inside like so. Now we lift and we bring the knee inside. Now from here, we go cross post and post outside of my partner's leg. And now as she goes to follow me, it's the easiest thing in the world, put my partner back in front and we go into a re-guard into a neutral position and then we can go into counterattacks. So what does this look like realistically? As she goes to make a transition, as she goes to move, and now we are once again recovered. So now let's look at some of the main body positions my partner can be in. There's two very different approaches. Normally, when you're working with someone at a high level, they'll integrate both of them. So they'll have the knees on the floor, they won't just stay in a high tripod, they'll move between the two. For control, a high tripod is going to be much more controlling. When you have to start going in and locking some missions, then you usually start to play a game where you move back down to your knees so you can start pummeling hands and you can expose your partner's limbs. And then you go back and forth between high tripoding and your knees down on the floor. So there are two main body positions we can be in in North South for the top player. One in a situation where my knees are on the floor. When my knees are on the floor, this makes it a pretty easy thing to pummel my hands in place and to pummel my partner's hands. And then when I want to put pressure on my partner, I can go into these high tripoding positions. If I feel like my partner is squirming around and trying to escape or trying to throw her legs up and do all those stupid things where people try to throw their hooks in and take your partner's back and stuff like this. Whenever I see this stuff going on or my partner is trying to bring knees inside my shoulders, this is a great time for me to go into a high tripod where I just take my ear and my shoulder to my partner's far hip and we just bring the knees off the floor and go into a tripoding position like so. Now when she has to bring the knees inside, it's very difficult. It's much more controlling. But you're also further away from your partner's arm so it's harder a lot of times to pummel hands in. So normally I'll control my partner here and then when it's time to start isolating my partner's arm, I go back to this position, I isolate arms and I move back to a high tripod and we play between having knees on the floor and having knees off the floor. So these are the two main body positions your partner can play when they're playing from a north-south. We have to be able to escape when my partner has knees on the floor and we have to be able to escape when my partner is in a high tripod where there's pressure on my hips, I can't bring my knees inside, my partner's on the feet and mobile and can move around to keep my head between their legs. So these are the two major body positions we can look at when dealing with escaping north-south pins. All right, so let's just quickly run through our opponent's different hand positions they can be in from both situations where they're on their knees and off of their knees in a high tripod. There's a lot less hand positions than side control and mount. There's basically just three. Your partner can have two elbows inside yours like so where she dominates the inside real estate. She can have two elbows in top position outside yours like so where you dominate the inside real estate. And she can have a situation where she has one arm under and one arm over where you both dominate a piece of the inside real estate and now you can both effectively pommel from here. So based on our partner's hand position, we have to start with initial pommels to get back to the preferred grips that we want and then start to go into escape from there. So contingent upon my partner's hand position, my partner's elbow position relative to mine, that's going to determine how we start the pommels. And then once we have our pommels into the correct position, the escapes will be relatively the same as we move through from the knees and from high tripod. All right, so this is going to come into play a little bit later, but I want to introduce this idea to you guys right from the beginning. Whenever we feel that we can bring knees and elbows inside the shoulders, we can easily escape from side or from north south. Against a talented opponent, most of the escapes are going to come by forcing my partner into a similar position that we were in before and forming a perpendicular angle with my partner and my partner's body. If my partner is parallel to me and she's in north south, she doesn't have to have control over my head directly in order to control my body. North south is the one exception where she can attack me without having direct control over my head. But when I force my partner into a situation where she has the body angle of side control, but the upper body grips of a north south, she then starts to fall apart positionally when she's trying to control me. So if she's in north south in any one of these positions, and if I can create a threat of generating motion towards a position where we're more in side control than we are in north south, and my partner's in a situation where she has the same grips as she did, whatever they may be, she has the same grips as she did in north south, but the body position now is different, and now the body position is one that we would have if we were in side control in bottom position, but the upper body grips with the hands are the same as they would be as if my partner was in north south. So what we find is that now we can start to go into escapes we looked at before where we can pummel hands back in, and now because of my partner's body position, she has to make a cranial shift because her body position is technically in side control. So in order to control me, she has to make a cranial shift where she goes to control my head, and on that transition we can start to recover. So there always has to be a threat between taking my knees inside my partner's shoulders and collarbones, and by generating motion to force a threat of me moving outside my partner's legs. She wants to keep my head between both of her knees and keep me pinned, where she can stay in north south and she doesn't have to have control over my head, direct control over my head in order to control me. So I want to get my head to one side of my partner's body, where now in order to control me she either has to walk back to north south and put me back in between her legs, or she has to make a grip change where she moves into a situation where she controls my head again and on that transition now we can start to go and bring our limbs back to the inside position. So there always has to be a threat of forcing your partner back into the body position that she would be in if she was in side control with this perpendicular angle. That way she either has to one, force her way back to north south, which we can stop by putting wedges outside our partner's legs, or she has to make a grip change going back into side control and getting control over the head, which is going to be much harder because you're ready for that and you can fight your hands back to the inside position. So if you understand this, escaping north south is much easier. You force your partner into a side control position with her body and she has to go in and re-control the head and as she does so, you're ready for that and you can bring limbs back to the inside and go back to guard. So let's look at pommeling our hands back to the inside position against someone who has their knees on the floor and has one of these three hand positions. So we're going to start in north south, probably the best way for you guys to say it, here, where my partner has two elbows outside mine, but I have a situation where my elbows aren't quite inside my partner's shoulders from here. So she's the inside elbow position with the outside, or she's the outside shoulder, or elbow position with the inside shoulder position. Ultimately, what I want is right now, if she retracts her elbows to her hips, my elbows, just put your elbow on mine, my elbows inside hers, but her shoulders are inside my elbows. So from here, what I want is to get eventually to a position where I can get one or two of my elbows inside of her shoulders and collarbones like so. Okay, so she's going to have the outside elbow position and I have to find a way to start moving my hands so I can get one elbow to the inside position. So from here, when I have two of my elbows starting on the inside position relative to my partner's elbows, we're going to look to take a cross hip post with our left hand and outside frame like so with our right hand. And from here, we're going to use either a walking method or a pendulum method to just quickly move my head to the outside of my partner's leg like so. Okay, now from this position, you can go into forcing side control and stuff like that, which we'll look at later, but from here, we're going to assume that for whatever reason, my partner can step past my frame and look to start circling and flattening me back out by putting my head between her libal bones again and moving back to the north-south. So from here, I move outside my partner's hips like so, and as that happens, I just take my elbow through and I move into this position. Now as my elbow comes through, you have to make sure you don't sit in this position for long amounts of time. Your partner can take a dark strangle through and start to put you under some pressure from here. So as I go to make this transition, I move quickly outside my partner's knees and she's going to follow me. I just slip my elbow inside and I have my elbow now inside my partner's shoulder like we want, and I have a cross hip frame with my left hand. So I have my elbow to the inside position, one monitoring my partner's upper body at the shoulder, one monitoring my partner's hips, and now we can start to go in and start our escapes. Okay, so that's the first one. That's where I have two elbows on the inside position. I take a cross frame, I take an outside post to my partner's leg. From here, we go in and we start moving and forcing our partner into some kind of side control situation with her body. As she goes to follow me, we take an elbow to the inside position and now we're ready to go. Okay? Conversely, this time my partner has two arms and elbows inside my elbows like so. Now my elbows are physically outside of my partner's. Whenever I see this, it's a pretty easy thing from here to start taking my hands through like so. Now once my hands come through inside my partner's shoulders like so, I have the inside hand position, I need to start working to the inside elbow position. So when I see this, my partner goes to start locking everything in tight. From here, I just pendulum out to one side and I use my left, if I'm going to pendulum right, I use my left hand to just slip a right elbow to the inside position. And now from here, I take my right hand inside and my left hand stays inside, whether it be up at my partner's collar bones or you can transition to a cross hip post like so. Both are very good. Okay? So this time my partner has the inside elbow position and my hands are completely stuck outside. Whenever I see this, it's going to be hard to start moving around and pummeling in here. Bringing my legs up, I can't get my knees inside. So whenever I see this, a great option is from here, I just give a small spring, I just scoot my hands in to position like so. So if she postures up, my hands are just on my own chest like so. She goes down and from this position, we just pendulum to one side. So I just whip my legs out to one side, then as I move across, she goes to keep a tight, tight lock. It's a pretty easy thing to get one of my elbows to the inside position. Okay? The momentum is what allows me to move from a position where I'm flat on my two shoulders to a situation where I angle out and I can pull the elbow free. My whole thing is as she goes to base out, I just pendulum. I play a game where I start rocking, rocking, rocking. She has tension at the inside hand position and the inside hand position allows me to gather the inside elbow position and from here we can take everything back inside. Okay? If we feel like for whatever reason that is just absolutely not working, it's not going to happen. From here, I take a cross hip post like so and I start playing a game where I move down and away from my partner. Now I take an outside post like so and from here, I just whip my body through and now as my partner goes to recover, we can take everything back inside and we steal the inside position. Okay? So, two good ways to fight back to the inside position. One, my partner has the inside elbow position. Two, I have the inside elbow position. And three, this time she has one elbow inside and one elbow outside. So she has her left elbow inside mine and I have my right elbow inside hers. Whenever I see this, from here, I take my left hand inside my partner's collarbones and shoulder like so. I take my right hand and I just take my partner's head and I move it to my center line. So from here, as I push the head across, I just walk towards the arm I'm trying to free. Now I take my hand to my own stomach. When she goes to make a strong body from here, I just give a quick bridge and I just move my hand inside the head like so. And now I pummel the hand through. Now I have two hands inside my partner's collarbone. And it's a pretty easy thing from here to start angling my body out and away, moving my hand across. And now I have the inside position at my partner's shoulder and we have that cross either collar, that cross collar, cross shoulder post, or we can move back and resort to the cross hip post. Okay? So we're going to be pummeling mostly into situations most of the time where we have one elbow and form inside my partner's shoulder. And then we have a second elbow on the opposite side, which is usually outside my partner's shoulder. So that means that we have to eventually find ways to insert my second elbow to the inside position. So I have two elbows inside and then I can bring two knees up and play a winning battle to get back to some kind of open guard. We established that we have to pummel one elbow to the inside position. If I can't pummel an elbow to the inside position, I have to start creating angles where I can move outside my partner's knees and forcing her into side control, forcing her to switch her grips to move to a cranial shift and then bring my hands inside, which we're going to look at a little bit, a little bit later. Now assuming I just want to escape right from north south. It's all going to be about getting my elbows inside and underneath my partner's shoulders and collarbones. If I can keep my one elbow initially and then my two elbows between the width of my partner's shoulders and bring my knees, my elbows together, you're going to be in pretty good shape from here. All right. So whenever I look at north south and I'm looking to escape, I have one hand to the inside position like so, and I have a second hand, either one inside my partner's shoulders at the collarbones or two inside my partner's hips. This is what I'm looking to go into escapes. I usually, to be honest, like to keep my, my, uh, my form across my partner's hips. And the reason for this is that so I can, I can manage distance between my partner's hips and my head. If I feel like I can't go into any of the escapes where I can bring my knees and my elbows together, I can always use this forearm to create distance between myself and my partner so that I can always move my head outside of her knees. Right now she has her knees and knees in very close. If I try to move outside my partner's knees, I get caught. I get run into her legs. But from here, when I use this as I use my left forearm to start extending my body away, when she goes to follow me, it's hard for her to bring her hips closer to me because of the forearm frame dominating her hip line. So now when she goes to start coming in towards me, the knees have a hard time blocking me and this makes it relatively easy thing to start moving outside my partner's knees. So I play a game where I'm trying to go into all the escapes we're about to look at. If I feel like that's not going to work, I look to start moving away from my partner as she goes to follow me. Go ahead. We can start moving out of the way and we can recover from a side control instead. So just keep this in mind as we're, as we're looking to go into these escapes. So I have my hand in either here or in here. In general, if I'm looking to start to bring knees and elbows together, I generally prefer my forearm up and close to my partner's shoulder line. This will give me a secondary hand to push with to create space between myself and my partner's chest. If I'm looking to force my partner to side control, then I generally prefer my hand down by the hip. I generally prefer this, this one, we're looking to bring elbows inside, I'm going to have my hand inside my partner's shoulder and forearm across the shoulder line. So that now from here, once I have one elbow inside, it's a pretty easy thing if she's not into, if she's not in a high, if she's not in a high tripod to bring my knee and elbow together. When she has to stop me from taking my right knee and my right elbow together, it's a pretty easy thing to just lift the shoulders just enough to get my knee inside my elbow like so. And now once my knee's inside my elbow, I start making space by taking my right foot higher than the height of my right knee. So when she has to drive in towards me, I just lift. Now from here, I shoot my left hand across so that my left elbow comes inside my partner's shoulder. And now I take a second elbow inside. Once she gets to start crushing me from here, the right, or the left knee rather, will always come to the inside position. And now you're no longer carrying your partner's body weight on your torso. She's completely supported by the inside position. I can hold her here for long amounts of time. And now from here, I take a cross post on my partner's hip. I keep that knee-elbow connection. From here, I take an outside post on my partner's knee. Once she goes to start, my partner's leg. Once she goes to start following me from here, I just create an angle where I move out and away from my partner. I extend my partner's hip away. And now from here, I fire leg across and we're ready to go in for the scissor guard and recover. So I see that from here, my partner's behind me in north-south. Actually probably a better angle. I see from here, we pommel a hand and an elbow to an inside position. We have a hand across our partner's hip or across our partner's shoulder line. For this particular movement, I'm looking to take my knees and elbows together. So I'm going to generally favor having a hand across my partner's shoulder line like so. From here, she goes to stop me from inserting a knee. And she's not in a high tripod. It's a pretty easy thing to just lift everything just enough so that my right knee can slide inside my right elbow like so. Now from here, she goes to start putting pressure on me. I extend the right leg. And now I don't try to pommel my left elbow in. Just focus on shooting your hand across your partner's body so that your left elbow comes inside the width of your partner's left shoulder. That's all I need. Now I have a hand in like so. She goes to start putting pressure on me. I just extend. I shoot the hand through. And now it's an easy thing to place a hand in the lap to bring a second knee to the inside position. And now she goes to put pressure on me. It's the easiest thing in the world to start coming through. So rotating back in front of my partner, and we can easily go into recoveries right from there. Okay. So we pummel into a situation where we have one elbow inside of our partner's shoulder. Once we have one elbow, that's all we need. In general, if I'm looking to start forcing my partner into a side control, my second hand monitors my partner's hips. So I can gauge distance between my partner's hips and my hips, and I don't get trapped between her knees. For this one, we're trying to bring two knees inside. I'm looking to monitor my partner's shoulder line. So I take the hand up inside my partner's collarbone, and I use one elbow to insert a knee and then knee elbow connection to insert a second elbow, a second knee. And then you have a perfect knee elbow connection on both sides. And all that's left to do is to rotate underneath your partner and put them back in front of you. So now let's look at pummeling hands back inside and what position we're going to be looking to pummel into when my partner's in a high tripod. Now understand when you're in a high tripod, you're not trying to get an elbow inside your partner's shoulder and insert your knees. There's no way you're going to be able to insert your knees inside your partner's shoulders and get a knee to elbow connection when they're in the high tripod. So your goals are a little bit different from here. When my partner is in a high tripod, again, we can have similar positions where I have my elbows inside my partner's elbows, but outside my partner's hips. So she goes into a high tripod position like so. And from here, we have to start going in and bringing hands back to the inside position. Now when her knees are on the floor and she's sitting back like this, it's kind of hard to pummel my hand to the inside, especially get my elbows to the inside. All right. I have to get my elbow inside my partner's shoulder. But my goal when I'm working from a situation where she's in a high tripod isn't to get my elbow inside the shoulder. Even if I do, I can't lift my partner's full body weight, tripodting into my hips and bring my knees inside. So whenever I see that she goes into a high tripod and my elbows are inside, I immediately just move to this cross hip post like so. And from here, I take a post on the outside of my partner's knee. Right? When I go to, when I'm trying to escape from a high tripod, I'm not trying to bring my knees inside. I'm trying to force my head outside both of my partner's knees to force her into a side control position where she has to change her grips and create movement towards an escape. Okay. So it's the easiest thing in the world to move to my preferred grips. My partner goes to a high tripod and I start with my elbows on the inside, but she goes into a high tripod and I just immediately switch right to grips like so. But from here, I take a cross post on my partner's hip and outside post my partner's leg. Or I take a cross post to my partner's hip, I take an outside post on my partner's leg. We start converting into a situation where we can create angles outside of our partner's knees. Now, a second option she has is that instead of having my elbows on the inside of hers, she can have her elbows on the inside of mine. And she can come forward and she can go to a high tripod like so. All right. Whenever I see my partner goes to a high tripod, I'm looking to pummel my hands back to the inside. Mostly because I'm number one, I can't escape. I can't use my hands to do anything. Number two, there's back at an arm danger. There's more danger. There's a kind of danger as far as my arms being exposed from here. The first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to turn towards my partner's head. So I just take my legs out, I pendulum out and over to the side like so. I take my right hand inside of my partner's shoulder like so. If at any point you try to take your hand out like so and your partner starts to elevate your elbow for Kimura like so and starts to pressure into you, I just use my knee to strip my partner's elbow off. So if at any point you feel like you're being exposed for Kimura, if I pendulum to one side and I pendulum too far and my partner exposes me and starts to create threats of Kimura, I just take my knee up and I pick my partner's elbow and I fight my elbow back to the inside position. So just understand that you can do that. If your partner uses your momentum to force you to over commit to a side, I just use my knee to free my elbow. If my partner stays in this position, I pendulum from one side to the other, or I just pummel the hand to the inside position like so. Now from here, she has my second hand trapped and I'm having a hard time freeing it. From this position we use a second, move back, we use a second pendulum to just pendulum out and force my partner to post the hand. And now from here we take a hand inside, we use that, we use that, take our second hand out and we move to this cross hip and outside post my partner's leg and we use that to start creating motion towards escape. So I see from here, my partner has two elbows inside mine, like so. And from here I'm losing a battle where I feel like I can't use my hands to do anything. I immediately start moving towards my partner's head. If I move this way, I can't pummel my left hand anywhere. I can't pull my hands up, I can't do anything. So my whole thing is I have to get my right hand inside of her right shoulder. So I pendulum right and now I move, I pendulum left and I get that hand inside. Many times this hand will come out and we'll take our left hand inside, but assuming she keeps her hands in good position and she goes into a high tripod from here, we use a second pendulum to get her to post and the hand comes out. Once the hand comes out, we come through, we go back down to a flat back position, we take our hand through, she stays in the high tripod and from here we go in and we move to our cross hip and outside post position. And finally, this time she has one arm inside and one arm outside. Now when she was doing one arm inside and one arm outside, from two knees down, the positions are symmetrical because of the fact that her head is on the center line. If her head is not on the center line and she's out in situations like this, then you start seeing those stupid escapes where people start coming in and they throw their legs up and they put hooks in. So her head, for that reason, has to be on the center line so when I go to throw my legs up I run into her head and I can't put two hooks in. But when my partner takes her head off center to one side, now she can have either one arm exposed like so or she can switch positions and have another arm exposed like so. So let's say that my partner is exposing and looking to trap my arm on the opposite side of the head. So she puts her high tripod in place and she moves into position like so. Whenever I see this, we take a cross hip post with our left hand and from here we just give a small pendulum the same way we just did and we just fight our right hand to the inside like so. And now we use that to pummel the hand through and we go to the cross hip post and the outside post of our partner's thigh. Whenever I see my hand on the opposite side of the head is exposed, I'm again looking to pummel that right hand to the inside position. So we go cross hip, we pendulum, pummel the hand to the inside and now we're ready to start working. If I see she's trying to expose my hand to submission on the same side as the head, she goes in here, this time she has one elbow inside and she has one elbow outside. Whenever I see this, I take a cross post with my opposite hand and from here when she goes to lock up tight, tight, tight, I use that same pendulum and I just pendulum out in this direction. So I go one, two and I use that to slip the elbow inside. So I create a lifting action with this cross hip post. When she goes to lock up everything tight, the pendulum allows me to come back inside and now I can use either a hip post on this side or I can switch my hands and I can use a hip post and outside post on this side. Now we can start working into situations where we can force our partner into different positions, moving back to side control, forcing her to regain control over my head and then work towards escapes. So this time, instead of having our goals being getting our elbows inside of our partner's shoulders, this time our goal is to use a cross hip post to get our head outside of our partner's knees. All right, so there's always going to be a time where my partner's on the knees and we can't get an elbow inside of our partner's shoulder or our partner's on a high tripod where you can never bring your knees inside their shoulders anyways and we have to start to convert our partner back to a situation where she has to move back to side control, regather control over my head and then recover. So when your partner's knees are on the floor, it's pretty straightforward because your partner's not very mobile and you can move quickly and it's hard for her to follow you quickly because she's on her knees. Once she's on her feet, she can rotate pretty fast so we need misdirection when she's in a high tripod. So let's take a look at both of these now. So my partner is on her knees and I feel like for whatever reason, I can't get an elbow inside my partner's shoulder like I want to. I want a situation like so. Whenever I see this, I take a hand to my partner's hip like so. Now I'm usually going to go in the opposite direction my partner's head is on. Right now if her head is in the center, I can go to either side. If my partner's head is more towards one side, I usually take a cross hip post on one side. If my partner's head is on the other side, I take a cross hip post on the other side. Whatever side my partner's head drifts to, if her head is on the left side of my body, I usually have a left hand cross hip post because I'm moving out to my right side. From here, I want to start to move outside my partner's knee. The problem right now is obviously my head is trapped between her two legs. So the first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to take two hands and just reinforce them as opposed to my partner's hip. So if she postures up, no, she'll posture up. I have two hands posted on my partner's hip like so. And now what this allows me to do is to move down and away from my partner. So from here, I just move down and away. I take my knees to my chest. I take my knees to my chest and I just kick my legs out and away and I shimmy my body down and away so that as she gets to follow me, the reinforced wedge across her hips will inhibit her hips from following me. I can get my head below her knees so I can start moving my head out to an angle. So I play a game where I just shrimp down and away like so. So now I switch to that outside post like so and I just pendulum from one side to the other. We move the situation like so. Now if in the worst case scenario, your partner manages to step past your frame and move back into north-south, we just pummel it out to the inside and now with the inside elbow, we can bring a knee to the inside. But most of the time when you're trying to convert back to a side control, when your partner goes to walk around your body, the hip post combined with the post in the leg, when she goes to walk around to north-south, she will just force you into a situation where you're just turning with her. So as she goes to run towards my head, I just move with her and she never gets my head back between her legs. Now her hand position is in a position of north-south, like so. But her body position is a body position like she would be in if she was in side control. So because her body is perpendicular to mine and we form this T now, it's going to be imperative if your partner wants to maintain a pin, it's going to be imperative for your partner to maintain or to gather control of your head and shoulders once again. If she can't move back to north-south and put your head between her legs, she has to have control of the head and shoulders. Otherwise you're going to escape. If my partner doesn't control my head and the shoulders, it's the easiest thing in the world to take my elbow inside and to just bring everything back to the inside. So what you're going to count on is a couple of things. Number one, your partner will take her left knee and slide it to your hip here. Number two, your partner's elbow will come over your hip. Like so, to wedge you in place. And number three, a cross face will come in. So now your partner can start to flatten you out, like so, if the arm is trapped across the body, even better. If you manage to free it and the arm comes across and your partner cross faces you and flattens you out, now you have a situation where you are flattened out in side control and your partner has control over your head. So you know that once you get to this position, your partner is going to have to make a transition to controlling your head again. So the second I see this and I know that she can't walk to north-south anymore, I immediately take my elbow to the inside position like so. Now from here, when she goes to start controlling my hips, she takes a tight waist across, no problem. She takes a cross face in place, no problem. I have an inside bicep tie and I have a cross shoulder post. So my right elbow is inside my partner's left shoulder. And now my right hand is inside my partner's shoulder and my left hand is inside my partner's bicep and elbow. When she goes to solidify a pin by controlling my head and shoulders, it's the easiest thing in the world to just shrimp away as she goes to control me and bring my knee and my elbow together and from here we can easily go in and create a situation where we have all the inside position. So if my partner is on two knees behind me in a north-south, I can't get my elbow inside my partner's shoulder. We just go in and we reinforce a wedge on our partner's hip like so. Now if I can get outside my partner's knees right away, perfect. But a lot of times you can't do that. So we just take our knees to our chest and we just scoot down and away like so. And now from here we pendulum or we just run to an angle. It's a pretty difficult thing for your partner to follow you here because she's on her knees and because I have a wedge outside my partner's knee. When she goes to follow me, I can usually spin to an angle. And now from here we take the elbow inside. She goes hip to knee. She goes elbow to hip on the far side to wedge my hips in place. She goes to put a cross face in, we intercept the cross face. We reinforce that frame and now as she goes to control me from here, I just take my feet in and I just shrimp out and away. I insert my knee and we can easily go in and make a recovery now. Okay, so that's my partner on two knees. When my partner now is in a high tripod, it becomes a little bit more difficult because now it's much harder to get outside my partner's knees and you don't have the ability ever to bring your knees up inside your partner's shoulders. So when your partner's on the knees, she's fighting two battles. One is the battle for your inside elbow and inside knee position. And two is the battle for your head staying between her legs. When she's in a high tripod, she's only fighting one battle. All she has to do to control you is to keep your head between her legs. I'm never going to bring my knees up and inside my partner's shoulders. So this makes the game easier for her because she's only fighting one battle versus two battles. So what I like to do is I like to start moving outside my partner's legs. If she's naive from here, I'll just take a cross hip post and I'll move again to the opposite side of my partner's head and we'll move out and away. The problem with this is, is that my partner knows that I want to do that and the second I go to start taking a post and moving, she just runs with me and it's hard to get outside my partner's legs. So what I do is I create a misdirection where I take that same cross post, but this time instead of posting in my partner's leg, I frame on the inside of my partner's leg like so. And now from here, I just pendulum in the opposite direction. Where from here, I go in the opposite direction like so. From here, if my partner doesn't react, it's the easiest thing in the world to just take a post outside my partner's opposite leg and now as she goes to drive forwards, I just set up into this overback position. And now we're playing a game where once again, we're in this overback position, I start bridging towards my partner, we slide the knee through and we win this battle. So if my partner doesn't react to the inside post on her leg with this cross post like so, it's the easiest thing in the world to move to overback positions. So I just go in, I pendulum in the opposite direction, normally I'd be penduluming in this direction. This time, I pendulum in the opposite direction and you can even use a cross frame with an inside post or you can switch your frames and use an outside post on this hand if you want to force the overback. Where now from here, I just pendulum out in this direction and I block my partner's leg. As she gets to run to north-south, the frame outside my partner's head, or outside my partner's leg makes it difficult. And I just shoot up to this overback position and we start playing from here. So your partner, you do this a few times and your partner starts to realize, okay, this is not good for me, my back's exposed. So what everyone starts to do is they start to overcommit and they start running and overcompensating in the opposite direction. So from here, I take that same side post as her head's on and we take an inside grip like so. Now I start pushing my partner in one direction. As she goes to run to keep my head between her legs, we pendulum out in the opposite direction. And now from this position, it's the easiest thing in the world as she goes to make that transition, come in and bring everything back to the inside position. And if she doesn't, if she stays in this position, it's the easiest thing in the world to start coming up and going into all those overback grips that we looked at before and playing a game from there. Okay? So we play a misdirection game now. This time she's behind me and she goes into a high tripod like so. From here, I can play with a cross post and an inside post to my partner's thigh. I can go with a cross post, I can go with an outside post to my partner's thigh. And from here, we start my misdirecting out in one direction like so. If my partner stays in this position, it's the easiest thing to sit up to overback grips. If my partner from here chooses to change her hand position and try to go to side control, we take everything back to the inside. Okay? So if my partner initially lets me go outside of her knees in either direction, we have overback grips and we have the ability to move back to side control. If I see on the other hand that from here, my partner is smart and as I go to start moving in one direction, my partner will immediately shuffle and keep my head between her legs. I threaten going in one direction and as she goes to recover, we go out and we go in the opposite direction. And now from here, we play a game where as she goes to recover into side control, we bring everything back to the inside position, we steal the inside real estate and we can beat her from here. So anytime we can move to these positions, whether it be on the knees or on the knees like so, or on the feet, it's possible to either one go into side control recovery, which is most common, or if my partner is an idiot and stays here, we can start building up to these overback grips and start coming in and going into all of our offense and back takes, leg locks, whatever you want from here. Okay. The main thing is going to be when you're working with someone on their knees, it's usually a pretty easy thing to start in the direction that you're going. So if you want to go right, you go right. When you're working with someone who's in a high tripod and they're mobile on their feet, it's going to be, it's made much more common for you to start in one direction and then misdirect in the opposite direction. So if you want to go right, you start left and then you misdirect back right because your partner can follow you with the goal in mind of keeping your head between their legs. All right. So I misdirected the one side and your partner is naive. They let you recover to that side or go into, uh, into overback grips. Most people will follow you in one direction and you misdirect side to side and you can go back and forth multiple times, uh, from side to side to side to side. And then eventually one of them is going to get your head outside their knees and then that's going to lead you into a recovery. Blonde ponytail. Let's show the back of your head. What is that? You just keep rolling on top of me all the time. Like a huge potato guy. Escaping when opponent moves from north south, north south to side control. All right. So I didn't want you guys to think that I just skipped this intermediary step between north south and side control. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. I told you I'll go from the intermediary steps between positions. Um, so we went from side control to north south and went north south. Now we're going to have to go north south to side control. So we forced our partner back into side control. So this is basically, it's going to be looking almost like the same thing, which he willingly moves back from north south into side control. So what, what the main, the main goal, main goal you're going to have when your partner's trying to move from north south back to side control is to stop, is to stop your opponent from gathering control over your head and shoulders. Okay. So come on. So when we're in the north south, if my partner willingly looks to move back to some kind of side control, she has to move first her knees outside of my head like so. And now she either has to go tight waist first or she has to go cross face first. Right? So the only goal as your partner goes to make this transition is first you take an inside frame on your partner's hip. Go ahead. Here. So that your partner can't steal the inside position with her hip relative to your elbow. And now you just stop your partner from controlling your head and shoulders. The most important battle is going to be fought at this upper cross face hand. When she goes to insert that hand as a cross face, my whole thing is to turn towards my partner and I take an elbow first inside my partner's shoulder. I intercept with an inside bicep tie and then I move to a cross shoulder post like so. So now as she goes to make a transition into controlling my head and shoulders, we bring the knees and elbows together. So when your partner's transferring from north south to side control, focus on one thing. Deny them control over your head and shoulders. So as she goes to move, however she's going to do it. And now we can easily bring the knee back to the inside, connect the knees and elbows and we're back in business as far as playing from open guard. So whenever I see someone trying to go from north south into side control like we talked about, in side control and a mount, in order for your partner to efficiently control and attack you, or effectively control and attack you, they have to have some kind of control over your head and shoulders. So when she goes to move from north south with no control over the head and shoulders into side control, just stop them from controlling your head and shoulders, bring everything inside and then connect knees and elbows and you can easily move back to some kind of open guard and attacking position. Huge potato guy. Tell me if this is not the same as what it was before. Same thing. Huge potato guy because he keeps rolling from side to side over my head. She keeps yelling at me that these are all the same clips. A high tripod in a north south is not the same as an opponent being on two knees. They're two different positions and you have to either have different escapes. True. If you try to do the same escapes for both of them, they're not going to work. It all looks the same, but they're different. And if you try to use your generic, oh, I'm going to put the head outside the knees from a high tripod, your partner's just going to walk with you and they're going to keep your head between the knees. So you have to use misdirection to escape from high tripods. And you also have the fact that you can't bring knees and elbows together inside your partner's shoulders because of the high tripod. They're different positions. They're different positions, but we did them different positions 15 times already. They're all different positions. We did each position one time. It just changed like a little thing. Yeah, it makes a difference. Hard. All right, so now let's kind of move from north south and side control into passing from side control into mount. This is one of the great instabilities as far as top pin go, tops pin, top pins go. When you're moving from side control to mount, this is generally when people get severely off balanced or even reversed. First we have to look at what major positions we're going to be looking at when we're moving from a side control into a north south or into a mounted position. My partner's going to be down and we're going to be working at stopping the mount with three major body positions. One is with the generic top head and arms. Okay, where I have a under hook and a cross face of my partner and we're looking to go into a mounted position. The other is with a double under hooks like so, which is by far in a way the hardest one to stop from bottom position getting mounted. I'll show you guys some ideas I have from here, but to be honest, there's not much. This is a very difficult situation to deal with where I go and I start mounting my partner. It can be very hard for her to stop me from mounting from here. The other is a situation where I have just a cross face, but no under hooks and I have to start crowding my partner's legs. You see guys will push legs down and start to step over to mounted positions where they can go in and start playing from here. Or as they go to start stepping over into mount, guys start posting hands to block the knee and from here they go back to a headed arm and they go in, they lock up and now they start passing with a top head and arm. Three main positions we're going to look at stopping from bottom position as our partner tries to mount us from side control. We're going to look at top head and arm, we're going to look at double under hooks and we're going to look at just a cross face where our partner starts to point our knees away and looks to either slide the knee across or step a leg over. So our partner has a top head and arm and she's looking to transition from side control into mount. The way she's going to do this is going to be through a shin mount where she drives her shin across my hips, puts the knee on the floor on the opposite side and flicks her foot out and then goes into your basic Jiu-Jitsu 101 mounted attacks. First and foremost, if we can ever lock a side guard when our partner goes to raise the hips and put her shin across my hips, that's always our go-to. So whenever I see that we're in side control and I have hands on the side and from here I see that my knee is packed into my partner's hip, anytime she tries to go into a shin mount, the second she raises her hips, we immediately lock a side guard and now we can use that side guard to start fighting back pin side position. That's number one, we've looked at that before. Now let's look at, okay, this time my partner is doing everything properly and she actually gets her shin up and across my hips, how can we try to address this from here? Understand that because our hips are rising, she's in an inherently more unstable position. Right now in a static position, she's in a strong position here. When she mounts me and she moves to a second static position with low hips and she goes into a full mount, she's in a static position here, there's no movement and her hips are low so she's inherently stable. But when her hips rise and she starts creating movement, that's when she starts to become unstable and movement is our friend in terms of looking for escapes. We want to create movement and if she's creating movement for us, even better. So this time my partner goes to take her shin up and across my hips like so. Assuming I have the inside elbow position, I take my hands inside my partner's hip like so and now it's better if you have your left hand inside but it's not 100% necessary. I allow my partner to start driving her knee across like so. As I see that, I take my knees into my chest. So now when she has to flick her leg to the outside, it's not impossible but it's more difficult and as she does that, I use a post on my partner's hip and I'm just going to look to elevate everything up and over my left shoulder and concave so that my partner's right hand has to post otherwise she'll fall over. If she doesn't post and she goes to slide aggressively into mount, it looks kind of stupid but because you're concave, your partner will easily fall over and it's hard for her to take the leg out. If she doesn't post the hand, then she's going to fall over and end up in bottom position. So oftentimes what's going to happen is your partner will take her right hand and she'll post that on the floor. So she goes to mount me and I just guide everything up and over like so. Now from here, we play a game where we switch from a post on my partner's knee or hip to a post along my partner's hip line like so. We take a second hand to reinforce that wedge. When she gets to settle into mount now, I dominate my partner's entire hip line. And from here, we just take our knees into the inside position. Once our knees are in the inside position, I just take my left knee up, I fire to my partner's hip, I take my leg into position and we're ready to go into a Rimi Ashi Garami. So she has a top-headed arm, I have a hand inside my partner's hip like so. She slides into a shin mount and she starts to go up and across my body. If I have my left, my right hand inside, it's better but it's not necessary. If I find my hand stuck on the outside and she's moving into mount, I just point my hand straight and I limp arm out. So as she goes to make the transition, we move into a situation like so. And now I concave my shoulders so the cross face slips off. From here, I take a post on my partner's hip like so. I take an elbow inside my partner's knee like so and I reinforce that wedge across my partner's hip line. When she goes to settle into mount, I have the inside position at the lower body. And I use that, I use this to dominate the space between my partner's knees by moving her knee out and away. And now you can drive a truck through the space between her knees. And it's a pretty easy thing from here to take my knee to my partner's hip, take my foot to my partner's hip and I can easily go in and make a recovery. So one more time, she goes to drive across, I time her driving across, go like that. I time her driving across and my whole thing is I just bump my partner and I concave out in this direction. So I take her a little bit further than she wants to go and force her to post a hand on the floor. So as she goes to start driving across, I just bump and I concave in this position like so. Now I take my hand into the inside position, I take my hand across my partner's hips and I start dominating my partner's hip line like so. I dominate the inside elbow position relative to my partner's knee. When she goes to settle into a mounted position, the easiest thing in the world to make space and then to throw my legs in and start to go into all my offense. Alright, so those are great. Now the question arises, what happens when my partner shelves my arm? Any good player, before they move to mount, is going to shelf the elbow up on the hip like so. And rightfully so because you deal with someone, even someone who does not even good, you're going to mount someone and they post a hand on your hip, even if they just explosively bridge you as hard as they can, like it's going to off balance you. So when someone isolates the knee inside arm and shelves it, now when she goes to mount you, I have no ability to drive off the hip and off balance her by pushing on the hip. So what do I do from here? I see my partner going to put her shin across my hips. From here, as she goes to start driving into a mounted position, I try to finagle my left hand inside and across my partner's hips. Now if this doesn't work, you're going to get mounted. So the race is, can she get her foot across, smack the ground, and slide her knee up to my armpit before I can get my hand across her hip. So as she goes into a shin mount, she goes to start driving across. As she goes to start driving across, I look to take my hand across and inside my partner's hip like so. And now instead of posting on my partner's hip with my left hand, I just use my elbow on my partner's hip and I use the same motion we just looked at, except for this time I won't be able to post on the hip because my arm is elevated, so I sneak my hand inside instead. And now from here, as she goes to mount me, we use that same off balance we used, we look to go in and reinforce the wedge, and then we look to put everything back inside and once again we can recover. So if she's on this side this time, this is different than the previous one. In the previous one we had the inside elbow position and we can post on our partner's hip. This time, if you try to use that same post on your partner's hip, you're going to be fishing, fishing, fishing, and then she mounts you and you're beat. So when I see this, my hand cannot get to my partner's hip. So instead, as she goes to mount me, I take my hand across and through to the far hip, like so. When I have the inside elbow position, I use a straight hip post. When she has the inside knee position, I use a cross hip post. And now from here, as she goes to start driving me across, or driving her knee across, I take her out into this position like so. My elbow comes inside, she tries to mount me, we take the knees inside, and we're ready to go in and start attacking our partner's legs. So in the intermediary step between side control and mount of the top-headed arm, there are three distinct stages. One, where as soon as she raises her hips, I form side guard and join knee to elbow connection. This is best. Then you have a situation where she goes to mount you, you can't form a side guard, but you have the elbow inside and you can post on a hip. This is kind of like middle of the road. And then you have your late stage escapes, where you've lost pretty much every battle, your partner shelves the arm up nice and high like she should, and then as she goes to mount, you make just enough space to go to a cross hip post, you use that cross hip post to make a little bit of space, and then you fight everything incrementally back to the inside and fire into an Irimi Ashi Garami. Alright, so now let's look at by far and away the hardest transition, when your partner has double underhooks on you and she has good head position, how can we stop our partner from mounting us? Understand that this is kind of the end of the road. If your partner is good, she should be able to mount you from here. You've lost all the battles for inside position, she managed to get to a shin mount, and you should be losing this battle from here. However, there is, minus a super explosive and spastic bridge, which is not technical at all, there is one escape that I have that could potentially get you out. And that's using that side kip that we used from side control, where we look to start kipping out and away, and kipping, kipping, kipping out to the side to get an initial and slight off balance in order to get my partner to post hands. So when my partner has this double underhook side control pin, and she has either locked or unlocked hand, and she has her head in good position like so, from here, you're not going to lock side guard, you're not going to be able to insert your knee inside your partner's hip, and she's always going to be able to get to shin mount. Now the problem is, you can't knee elbow escape on either side when she mounts, and it's very difficult to do anything from here. So as your partner drives that shin across your hips, what I'm going to look to start doing is I'm going to start bringing my knees up to my chest, and I'm going to start trying to pull my elbows down and push in my partner's hips, and get her moving out towards my right, the side she started on. This isn't with the intention of trying to force my partner back down to side control or anything like that. It's just to get her to give me a stronger push in the direction she wants to go, which is towards mount. And as I'm pushing in this direction, she gets to start pushing back towards mount, and then all in one motion, as she gets to slap the floor, and she gets to drive her knee to the ground, I'm just going to pendulum from one side to the other, and I'm going to hit a side kick with the intention of getting my partner to post a hand out and away to screw up her head position potentially a little bit, and then from there pummel a hand to the inside. This is a kind of a last ditch effort. It doesn't always work. It's very hard to get it to work on high level guys, but this is like your one option that you have if she has double underhooks and she's trying to mount you. So I push, push, push. As she gets to start driving her knee to the floor, I kick out to the side like so, and I make just enough space to pummel a hand to the inside position. Now once the hand is on the inside position, I take my elbow to the inside. And now from here, we're technically mounted, but we just continue the side kip, the kip, kip, kip, and then we can start bringing knees to the inside, and we'll look at more of the side kip later when we go into escapes from mount. This is the idea. It's to force your partner into a mount, but a mount where I have the inside knee position, and I can continue the kip after I initially use her momentum to get her posting a hand out on the floor. So she has double underhooks, and from here, she goes into a position where she tries to mount me. Now, making it like I want to push her back in the direction that I came. So when she gives a stronger pushback, I just pendulum out to the side, and then as we go, I kip, kip, kip, kip, kip, and a lot of times, this hand will come out and post on the floor, and that's what we're looking for. So I start by pushing in the opposite direction. She goes to give a strong pushback, and I take the inside elbow position. And now as she goes to start cross-facing me and mounting me, I take a knee to the inside, and we can at the very least recover into a half guard. If we get the knee to my partner's right hip, if she drops her knee down, it forces me into butterfly half guard, which is fine. Or if we can get the knee to our partner's opposite hip, we can go in and fire to a Rimi Ashi Garami. So this is like my one last ditch escape on a technical level, not just trying to explosively bridge your partner and hoping that their weight is misplaced. This is like my one go-to escape. My partner has double underhooks, good head position, goes to a shin mount and tries to drive across. I initially start pushing them back in the direction they came to elicit a stronger pushback, and then I use the momentum to go right into a pendulum into a side kip, hoping they post the hand. And if they do, we can pummel the hand back inside, get to an inside elbow position, and then separate the space between the knees and hopefully bring the legs back inside. Easier said than done. This is like the worst position you can be in as far as like escaping from bottom pins and having your partner try to mount you, but this is the one thing that you can do which can be reliable. All right, so now let's go into a situation where my partner has a heavy cross face and she looks to start using a free hand to step over and to mount, whether she looks to go for a step over, which is like something Hodger Gracie was really good at, or she starts going into a shin mount where she drives in the across first and then looks to start mounting me. This can be a real issue, especially in the Gi. When we're looking at it from a no Gi perspective, what she's going to look to do is put a heavy cross face in, she's going to look to grab my hips, point my knees away, and now she's going to look to either take a big step up and over like so, or she's going to look to go into a shin mount where she drives her knee across first and then goes into a mounting position. So, the first thing I'm looking to do, the second I see this, is the second she unlocks her hands, if she can successfully grab my hips and point my knees away from her, now I start to run into problems from here. So if she unlocks her hands, go back, if she unlocks her hands, move up towards my head, if she unlocks her hands and she tries to start using this cross face right from here, immediately, the second she goes to start pushing my legs together or crowding my hips, I just immediately bridge and I take the cross face off and I put my head underneath my partner's shoulders like before. Okay, so if at any point your partner makes the mistake of unlocking their hands and trying to use the cross face to either push your legs to one side or pull your legs towards them and step over, I just immediately clear the cross face like so and bring my legs back inside. The danger starts to arise when your partner actually does move into a situation where she elongates your body by using the cross face to open up her elbow and then pointing my knees in the opposite direction of the escape. So my first thing is I'm going to immediately, she circles towards my legs, I'm going to immediately look to start shrimping out and away. So from here, she has no control over my hips on the far side, so I just quickly hop, hop, hop and as she goes to follow me, I just clear the cross face and now knees and elbows can join together and we can escape. If I find that my partner is doing such a good job of cross facing me and crowding my hips that I just absolutely can't start walking away from my partner, now I'm in real danger. So from here, the second I see this, we just take a hand inside and we just grab our own head like so with this backhand frame. From this position we take a hand inside and now as she goes to start going in for a mounted position, I just immediately start walking the cross face up high. So now as my partner goes to crowd my hips once more, from here I just lift the cross face up to a degree where she no longer has a bite on the cross face. And now from here, it's the easiest thing in the world to strip the grip, I can start going in, facing my partner and bringing knees back to the inside. The biggest danger I face if she's down, as a bottom player in situations where the cross face is so strong and my hips are getting crowded like so. This is no good. Where now when she goes to face me, she can't face me. I can follow her, I can walk with her. And then from here I start pushing the knees down. I start going and I start stepping over. I start leg riding. I start going into shin mounts. I start doing all kinds of things like that. So this second, from bottom position, you see this? Just use a backhand frame and touch your own head like so. And now from here you just start walking your fingers up your own head and this will clear the cross face. And now as I got to start pinning you, because the cross face has no bite anymore, you can start moving your body out and away, facing me, and then you lose control of the cross face and the knees can come back inside. So whenever I see my legs are getting crowded and I feel like my partner is threatening to step up and over and she has a strong cross face in place, we have a couple of good options. One, we immediately clear the cross face and put our head underneath our partner's chest. Two, if I see my partner does a good job of crowding me, then from here it's all about either walking my hips away once again and then facing them, bringing the knees back inside or using that backhand frame to clear the cross face. And at any point if I see that I can, if my partner has minimal control over my legs, she's using her cross face, she goes to start crowding my legs like so, if she has a post on my legs with her hand, I can't use pendulum methods. But from here if she goes across my hips for example like so, from here I can use those pendulum methods where I start moving my partner out like so and I start using that to clear cross faces over and start going into my tricep post series. So this is a very prominent way of my partner trying to mount me when she can't get an underhook. Maybe for example she passes from half guard or half guard like so, I'm trying to get an underhook and she has her hand inside, I can't get an underhook. We come in, I go in like so and I use a scoop grip to pass from half guard. And now I'm trying to pummel underhook and I just can't do it. We have to be able to escape from a situation where our partner is crowding the hips with her hips turned and they look to start stepping over and to mount. This is a very prominent and very dangerous way my partner can start stepping over my legs and mounting me. So we have to be able to deal with this. So our first thing is if we can ever clear the cross face, we can start facing our partner and bringing the head underneath the chest and bringing knees back inside. If we feel like our partner is circling towards the hips and we can hop, hop, hop away because my partner has no control over my hips and we can bring the knees inside. And if we feel like we can't bring the knees inside, we can't face our partner, then we have to start either one, kipping out to the side to off balance my partner or two, if she's controlling my legs so I can't create a pendulum motion, then I have to use a backhand frame to walk up, loosen the bite on the cross face and then work from those scenarios.
