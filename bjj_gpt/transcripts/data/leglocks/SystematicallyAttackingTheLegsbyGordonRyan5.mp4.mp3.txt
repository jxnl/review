 So now we're going to move into cross ashi garami. Cross ashi garami is, in my opinion, the best leg locking position you can find yourself in as far as leg locks go. Number one, you have mechanically the strongest heel hook that you can go for. You have an inverted heel hook. Number two, your feet are relatively safe. Now there are some, you could make an argument as far as 50-50. There is more degree, there is more passing exposure. Your partner can put more pressure on you if they get their knee to the floor from cross ashi. There is more back exposure from cross ashi, but there's a lot less of your feet being exposed to your partner's attacks. Whereas in 50-50, there's not really any, your partner's not going to pass you from there. You can attack if the knee is still trapped, but your partner can attack your feet pretty easily from there, both with toe holds on the outside foot and with heel hooks on the inside foot. So you can make arguments on these things, on which one you prefer, which one's the best. But for me, cross ashi is going to be the best one because you have very strong mechanical inverted heel hooks versus outside heel hooks, and your feet are pretty safe relative to the other positions that you can do inverted heel hooks from. So cross ashi is going to be one of my favorite positions, and I tend to go back and forth between cross ashi and inside ashi, and then moving to outside ashi off of the inside ashi, which we'll look at later. But very interesting, a lot of transitions from here, a lot of possible different upper body gripping configurations, and ways to expose my partner's heel from this cross ashi situation. All right, so now let's look at some leg positions we can use from this cross ashi groundmate position. All right, so when I have cross ashi, my legs are just inside my partner's legs like so, whether they're open, whether they're foot to foot, this is just cross ashi. This is the position of cross ashi groundmate. Okay? We have cross ashi groundmate inside Senkaku, where my legs are physically figure forward inside my partner's legs. So cross ashi groundmate refers to just the position, and then inside Senkaku refers to the actual triangle, or the triangle locked inside my partner's legs. Okay? So cross ashi, we have inside Senkaku, we have shoelace ashi, where from here I raise my partner's hips, and then we take our shoelaces and we place them on our partner's hip on the opposite side. Okay, so we have a shoelace ashi from here. All right, let's rotate. Shoelace ashi, here. Okay? Then we have a far hip ashi, where from here we take our feet out, we're in cross ashi, we move across to a far hip ashi, like so. Right now we block our partner's far hip. Get everything inside, we go in, we go far hip ashi, like so. We have one foot across, we have two ankles crossed over our partner's far hip. Okay? We go into far hip ashi. And then we have crisscross ashi, where we basically cross our feet in a crisscross shape like so. We have bottom side, where my inside leg is protected. We have top side, where my inside leg is exposed to inverted heel hooks. Okay? Obviously you want to be in bottom side crisscross when possible. Okay? So we use cross ashi, just a generic position. We can use foot over foot positions or unlocked feet to expose our partner's heels. We can use incising kaku, or triangles, just to control our partner's legs through transitions. Make sure we don't hurt our knees like I did when I tore my LCL against Joao Rocha. We have shoelace ashi, where we're looking to easily expose, more easily expose our partner's primary leg. Makes it much harder for my partner to roll defensively in this direction. I can control my partner's near side leg much better with the shoelace ashi. We use a far hip ashi. This will prevent my partner from rolling over in this direction. Okay? So whether you go here, whether you put a heat on, she goes to roll, I control my partner's hip or I control my partner's hip. So now when she gets the high leg over, she can't do it. Okay? And then finally, crisscross top side, crisscross bottom side is always good to control my partner's leg, keep my leg safe and bottom side crisscross. And from here, once you guys start rolling defensively, it's a pretty easy thing to hook into my partner's far leg, make it hard for her to roll, to point my knees in a situation where now when she goes to roll out defensively, it's not impossible, but she has to palm her legs and it takes a longer time for her to start rolling. Okay? So those are some of the times that you would use one ashi Grami versus another. And as we go into this, we'll get more and more in depth into why I use one ashi Grami or one variation versus the other, one of these subsystems. Okay? But just some basic leg positions. So you have cross ashi, which is just a general position. You have insides and cock, which is the triangle. You have shoelace ashi, where you control your partner's near hip with your shoelaces, but you have far hip ashi, controlling your partner's far hip, obviously stopping them from rolling. And then we have crisscross ashi, both top side and bottom side. All right, let's look at some of the main issues and some main reactions my partner is going to have from cross ashi. We looked at it from a Rimi ashi, we looked at it from an outside ashi. Let's look at it from a cross ashi now. So number one, if I lose the secondary leg, and if at any point my partner can bring her heel into her butt, she can tuck her leg in like so, and she can come up and she can start stacking me. She can physically heist up, and now she makes upper body grips, this is no good. All right, so number one is if I don't control my partner's legs in an adequate way, and she can start taking your heels in towards the butt, she can start heisting, I can get stacked and I can get my guard passed and my back taken. In addition, there is some degree of back exposure. If she goes to start rolling from here and I go belly down and we go into a double inverted position and she can hit a misdirectional escape, like a sleeper hit on me, and now from here she can go and she can start exposing my back, which is no good. So there is some degree of passing exposure if your partner can start stacking you, and there's a degree of back exposure as well. Your partner can also hit re-pommels from here, if you're lazy with your legs, your partner can re-pommel, beat you on the pommel, pull the leg through, and now from here she can start attacking you. This actually happened with me and Kenan, he beat me on the pommel, but I managed to separate his legs, and I heel hooked him anyways. But you're in a precarious scenario here because if your partner does lock an outside heel hook, your legs are figured forward, and from here you have no ability to roll because your right leg keeps you wedged in place. So you are in a sticky situation here if you do get beat on a re-pommel. So she can re-pommel. So she can stack you, and pass you, she can take your back, she can re-pommel the legs, and then also you just run into the problem of from here losing the primary leg. Where from here she takes that leg out and now I'm with an imiri Ashi Kamae on the secondary leg, but it's not as good as a cross Ashi. I also run into the issue of losing the secondary leg before I can start to go in and get my partner's heel. Where now she starts rolling, rolling, rolling, and she ends up in a situation where she just rolls out, or she starts to roll and creates a misdirection and ends up taking my back. So you run into these problems here. And then there's just the problem of going in for the heel hook where I have to release my partner's secondary leg at some point in order to actually go in and attack my partner's heel. So right here I have very good control. I can control the position for a very long amount of time. But at some point I'm going to have to release the secondary leg, whether it be here, whether it be here, I have to release the secondary leg in order to actually go in and get to my partner's heel. And now from this position, as I go to release that secondary leg, your partner has a chance now to go in and start turning, whether it be before I get to the heel, whether I just go in, I just release and I try to get to the heel, she can start turning, or whether it be after I get to the heel, before my hands are locked, where now from here she can start heel slipping and turning out in a way. It's always going to be an issue where you have to release the secondary leg at some point in order to get a strong breaking position in your partner's primary leg. And that's the time your partner uses to go into a defensive reaction and roll out. Okay. So you always have positional issues. And then you have the actual issue with the submission where you have to release the secondary leg if you want to actually be able to break your partner's primary leg. Okay. So that's the general main issues associated with cross-hachi garami. All right. So just some basic theory when we walk through cross-hachi. Obviously, the longer you can control your partner from here, the easier it's going to be to actually work to a submission. All right. Don't rush these things and then just lose your partner's leg. A cross-hachi is one of the harder positions to actually get into. So chances are it took you a while to actually get into a cross-hachi situation. So I want to control my partner as long as I can from here. And then I want to just look to climb up my partner's leg. If at any point she starts moving the knee down towards my knee line, I just always want to look to start coming in and finding ways to start climbing back up my partner's leg. Whether I have to switch legs or whether from here we can come through and drag our partner back in. We can always climb back up my partner's legs and bring my hips towards hers. Or we can control our partner for long amounts of time. Okay. And then we have to start finding ways to expose our partner's heel, with either inside or outside heel hooks. Whether it be passing a leg across, like so. Whether it be shelving a leg, like so. We always control our partner long enough to go in and start getting into heel hooks at best scenarios. What we always want to try to avoid at all costs is situations where we have little control over both of my partner's legs and she is just rolling, rolling, rolling, creating motion towards an escape. All right. I want to try to control movement and negate movement from here until I can work towards a submission. I want to try to create movement towards an escape. Okay. And if at any point I see my partner's angling so far out in a way where I just feel like inverted heel hooks are just not going to be possible from here, you can always start transferring across to inside Ashi. Where now from here, we look at start going into outside heel hooks and we can stop our partner's defensive roll. And your partner has to now turn back towards me, belly up. She can start going into one of those crazy multiple rolling sequences where she eventually can escape from here and then we can transfer back and forth. And at the very least from here, we can start controlling my partner's second leg. We can threaten the outside heel hook. We can pass it back across and now we can go back to our control position and we can go back to work from here. Okay. And finally, if you feel like none of this is working, always remember you have the choice to just heist into top position. Okay. So if I feel like for whatever reason I can't pass my partner's leg, I can't hit heel hooks and she's looking to move away. She's freaking out. She's a lot, very slippery from here. As she goes to move out and away, I just heist up and now I dominate top position and now we can start going into guard passing. So don't forget about this option if you feel like the legs aren't there and heel hooks aren't available. So just some general theories and basic ideas when you're working with cross Ashi. Control your partner as long as possible. Negate movement. Stop them from going into multiple rolling sequences. Okay. So you can always find yourself inverted and trying to chase a heel while you're behind and always have the option to pass legs across where you can threaten an outside heel hook on your partner that stops the first initial defensive role. So your partner can't go into those multiple roles and then you can work from there. You can pass back across, you can go for outside heel hooks, you can do all kinds of things. And if it all fails, just release the legs, heist into top position and go right into your guard passing. All right, so let's look at some basic leg pummeling we can do when we only have control of our partner's primary leg. We're in here, if we have the secondary leg controlled, she can't really do much. But if I lose the primary or the secondary leg and she goes to start pummeling, what I can't have is a scenario where she pummels her leg through, she pulls my leg in, and now from here we're caught in a figure four. Now there's no leg pummeling for me to do from here. It's going to be very hard for you to extract your leg. And if your partner does start to get here, I have to start focusing now and start trying to strip grips, pull my leg out. But it's going to be hard from here. All right, and we'll go more into this in leg lock defense when we do an instructional on that. But from here, just starting off, when she goes to pummel inside my legs, it's all a battle of inside position. So she takes her foot to the inside and I just pummel my foot to the inside. She takes her foot to the inside and we just play this pummeling battle. Of course, the hands will be involved from here. So as she does the pummel, she's trying to grab my leg and pull it through. So when she goes to pummel to the inside, I pummel to the inside. And now from here, I always want to go in and I want to catch my partner's ankle like so. I want to catch my partner's knee like so. So when she goes to pummel a second time from here, she can't do it. And now I can regather and collect my partner's secondary leg, lock up that Achilles and control my partner with Ashi grip on me on one side, Achilles grip on the other side. And now we can go in and start attacking our partner. So if I lose the secondary leg, I'm going for the heel hook. I feel like it's not there. And from here, she goes to pummel, I pummel. And now I can even go in, I can start using stretch Ashi, which we'll look at more later when we start passing legs across. Where I physically stretch my partner's legs out with my leg. This is a variation of stretch Ashi grabbing. And now when she goes to pummel, it's going to be a lot harder from here. And as she does, this delays the action where now I can pummel it back inside or many times as she goes to pummel, I just pull my foot back in and she moves right onto my hands. Okay, so there's many different ways we can pummel from here. But the most basic one is we just pummel to the inside and we just take turns pummeling inside, pummeling inside. And now from here, we just go in and we catch. So we put a wedge behind our partner's knee, a wedge in front of our partner's ankle. When she goes to pummel, she can't do it. Now we gather that second leg. This time I'm trying to go in, maybe I can't reach with my hands right away. She goes to pummel inside. And from here, I go to stretch Ashi. She has to move my leg even with her hands from here. It's going to be hard because there's tension running through my partner's legs. And now from here, if she really gets a strong pull and she falls too far to her left hip, she exposes herself to an inverted heel hook. Okay, so it's a very precarious scenario for her. And now from here, she goes to pummel, I just shorten my leg, she comes onto my hands. Now we can recapture the second leg and go to our attacks from there. So just some basic leg pummeling from this position you're going to encounter. At all costs, what you don't want is for your legs to be figure forward. I'm caught in this position here. This is no good. If at any point your partner beats you in the pummel and she has to pull that leg through, just focus on extracting your right leg like so before you get figure forward in. So the second she beats you, you feel like you're going to get beat in the pummel, I just take my foot out. And now as she goes to pull it through, I shoot my foot across. So when she goes to pull my foot in, I have a reinforced wedge and now it's far hip-ashi. I feed her safe and I can still go into attacks with my partner. Don't end up like this. This is horrific. Okay, so if she beats me on the pummel, we're here, she beats me, she has to pull everything through, now our legs are safe again. Now we can start going to work with our inverted heel hooks. So now let's look at a figure four achilles on our partner's far leg where we come in and we use, we can test our partner with various achilles locks, but usually we use achilles locks to either test our partner and get submissions or we use them to set up heel hooks as our partner raises the hips to avoid the achilles. So I'm going through this achilles lock, I take my right hand, we bring it through like so, just like we did from outside-ashi, inarimi-ashi, and from here we can set that achilles lock right where we want it, like so. Now because we don't have an ashi-garami on our partner's far leg, we're probably going to go with the tightest circle that we can, which is a full figure of four. So from here, we set our hand like so, we set the achilles grip, we pinch the elbow in, we raise the elbow high first. This brings the leg as high as possible. I don't want the elbow down here, the hands are low. I raise everything up high, I set it. Now from here, we go in and we just lock a full figure of four. From this position, we have the choice of going foot to foot, which is good, or we can put our foot on our partner's ankle. Both are very good from here. And now from here, I'm sorry, on our partner's hip. And now from here, we just go in. As we lean back, the whole thing is to take my left elbow down to my hip. This is what gets the break. So as I bridge, my hips come forward, my left elbow comes to my hip, and my elbow comes inside, I'm sorry, outside rather, my partner's ankle. And now from here, we lean back, and as we lean back, we continue to bring the left elbow across the body towards the hip, and we get incredibly strong finishes with a figure four achilles on our partner's far leg. So we have this initial control achilles, we're in cross-ashi. From here, elbow comes through. We set the achilles grip. As we set the achilles grip, elbow comes high to bring the hand and the chin close together. And then we set it. Now from here, figure four comes in. We can go foot over foot, or we can go heel to hip. Both are good. Elbow comes outside my partner's ankle. And now as we lean back, we just take the elbow across the body down towards the hip. As the hip come in, we get strong figure four achilles locks on our partner's secondary leg. Okay, so this time, we can go with the reverse figure four. This one's actually tighter. And it gives you the ability to start exposing your partner's heel off of this achilles, which we'll look at next. Okay? So this time, we go in. Instead of setting the figure four achilles, this time, we go through and we just take our hand from this position. We shoot our left arm forward. So we control our partner's legs with both of our arms. We shoot the left hand forward so that now from here, we can make space for that right hand to come through. We lock up like so. We get to the long end of the lever, we lock up and we lock a full figure four, like so. Now once again, we take that left elbow outside our partner's ankle. And now as we fall down towards our hip, the whole thing is hips coming in, elbow coming across the body. You won't be able, the lock is so tight if your hands are high, you won't be able to quite get your elbow outside your partner's calf muscle without submitting them. So what it'll look like is I go in and as the elbow's coming outside my partner's primary leg and the hips are coming in, you get strong finishes. But the goal is what I want is I want this. As I fall, my elbow comes down to my hip. So I pull the right elbow back, I pull the left elbow across and down towards the hip and that gets me strong finishes. So we go from, instead of going to a figure four, we go reverse figure four and that gives us incredibly strong finishes with the achilles lock on the far leg. You can get legitimate breaks with both of these. So we go in here, we take this hand through, whether we have incisive concus, whether we have open feet, whether we have foot to foot, it doesn't really make a difference. The main thing is we have good hand position here. I take my elbow forward and now we take this second arm through and we catch. Now from here we can go and we can transfer to a figure four. Once we have the figure four locked, the whole thing is hands are high, chin's low. And now from here, as we fall back, we take elbows to hips and we get strong finishes. We can get incredibly strong reverse figure four locks from here. If you notice that right, my everything's locked up. Right here, she's on breaking point. Any further than this, she'll break. I still have all this motion left to go through. You can get very, very strong breaks from here. So you have figure four Achilles, we're going to reset. This is strong. Reverse figure four is even stronger. And when we fall across and go for that break, you get legitimate breaks while you have legitimate control of your partner's two legs and a strong break in the secondary leg. All right, so now let's look at using this reverse figure four Achilles to get my partner's hips high. She's focused on the Achilles, the hands usually come to the floor to alleviate the pressure. The second she feels this, from here I start leaning back. From here, she has to bring the hips high and put the hands on the floor. The second I see this, I'm going to look to start exposing my partner's heel here. I'm falling across the body. If she falls this way, she breaks her own leg. She has to come with me across into this direction. As she does so, she will always expose this foot here. Now if I use an incising pocket with a triangle of my legs, she can back heel and make it hard for me to expose her heel. So I generally recommend with this one, I use just a cross Ashi with my two feet on top of one another. So when she does the back heel now, it's much harder for her to move her foot, for her to flail her foot around. A lot of times you're trying to dig and you get the toes trapped, but then she kicks her leg back and forth and you lose it. This makes it much harder for her to tuck her leg, makes it much harder for her to move her leg. So as she goes to hide the heel from here, I can use that cowboy drill to expose my partner's heel pretty easy from here. So when I have this reverse figure four Achilles, I start putting heat on my partner. I'm just going to keep my hands low because there's a lot of pressure from here. I'm starting to bring heat to my partner. The hips rise. As the hips rise from here, we go foot to foot. When she goes to hide that heel, I just quickly use that cowboy drill where I unlock my hands and I just lift my partner's leg out of the way. So she's trying to pull that foot out. She's trying to move that foot. She wants the Achilles to come off. I just lift it. And now I just use that quick cowboy drill where I point my knees in the opposite direction of her escape, which is this way in order to heel slip. And we just go in and we catch. And now from here, we go in. We lock the figure four back up. Now our breaking mechanics are the same as they were with the outside heel hook when we were belly up. My knees splay from here and then I open my left elbow in an arc over my body. So my hands are in tight. From here, my knees splay, back heeling, and I open my partner's leg into a straightened position. Realistically, when I lock up, I want to be here. She's on breaking point already, not even doing anything. I still have all of this motion left to go through. So the mechanics when you're palm to palm, when you're belly up with the inverted heel hook, are the same as belly up with the outside heel hook. We use this reverse figure four. From here, we start putting heat on. She has to fall with me. As she does, we just go from, if we have an inside Senkaku or knees down by our partner's hips, we bring a knee high and we go foot to foot. From here, she goes to hide that step primary leg. It's difficult. So now we just release the arms. One hand goes up, the other hand goes down. We just catch our partner's toes. My tricep catches the toes and we use that cowboy drill to catch. And now from here, we lock up. She stays belly up, she gets broken. And from here, she rolls over. Now we're belly down. Now the mechanics are different. Now we're going into the same belly down mechanics we had before. Strong back heel, pinch of the knees with the top knee coming down towards the floor. I'm looking over the bottom shoulder. I'm taking my partner's toes down to her buck. I'm pulling the heel to my chin and I'm bridging belly down and that gives her strong finishes in the belly down position. Okay. So the belly up and belly down mechanics are the same for both inside and outside heel hooks. And we're using that reverse figure four Achilles to get my partner's hips off the floor. They were thinking about that. And then as she's thinking about that, we use that quick cowboy drill where we catch the heel, we lock everything up and we go in for our strong finishes from cross Ashi. All right, so let's look at finishing on leg lace. Now we have control of our partner's secondary leg where we go in, we come in and we look to start going in and we retract our left elbow back to our hip like so. And now we pull our left knee in towards us like so. Okay. This will give us initial control so that when we let go of the Achilles grip, it's pretty easy to make a switch into this leg lacing position. Now I want her leg as far extended towards me as possible. She wants to alleviate pressure by pulling the leg out. Okay. So that's why the first thing I do is I extend backwards and I pull my elbow back to my own hip. Now I pull my opposite leg in and I can even grab my partner's knee like so. We throw our, our, our, uh, elbow through because it's a long end of the lever on our partner's primary leg. And now from here, in order to tighten everything first, we lift yellow high and the chin comes low. This tightens everything up. So now we go and we lock in wrist to wrist, the tightest grip possible. Okay. A figure four for me doesn't really make it any tighter. Wrist to wrist is sufficient enough. Now from here, we fall across our partner's body and we have the choice of going again, foot to the hip like so, or foot over foot. Now as we finish, the finishing mechanics will be an opening of my left elbow over my head in an arc and my right knee pointing in the opposite direction. So as my right, my left elbow opens east, I need point west in combination with a bridge. You get incredibly strong leg lice finishes from here. We go and we have to control the secondary leg. We control the leg further and get extension by pulling the left elbow in. We pull the left knee up like so. And now from here we can grab our partner's knee and we switch to a leg lacing position. Now you want to tighten everything up. We want our partners, the front of our partner's ankle up high in our armpit. Okay. The way we do this is by taking our chin down with concave shoulders and by lifting the elbow up nice and high. And now we go in and we lock. From here it's already tight. Now we fall down to the hip and we post on our foot like so, or our partner's hip like so. And now from here, as we point our knees to the left, we open our left elbow up to the right. That gives us incredibly strong leg lice finishes for the win. We test our partner here. If we get a tap, great. You can break people here, but at the highest levels, it's hard, unless your mechanics are perfect to actually get good breaks on people. So I test my partner a lot of times. It's a very good controlling position, very good to test your partner and very good to set up heel hooks provided you don't actually get the leg lace. So let's look at how to set up a heel hook now off of this failed leg lace attempt. Okay. So we can use this leg lace just like we used the reverse figure four appeal is to get my partner tilting to the correct hip. Okay. She wants to be on her right hip to defend. I want her on her left hip for heel exposure. So we can use this leg lace to start testing our partner. If my partner from here starts turning to her right, she puts more pressure on the leg lace because she has to fall down to her left hip. Okay. So I start putting pressure on my partner through the leg lace like so. If I feel it from here, my partner's not tapping. She will always be trying to pull the top leg out and shorten the top leg. Okay. So she, there's, it's gonna be painful from here for this leg lace and there's gonna be breaking pressure. So from here I allow my partner to start pulling the leg free and as my partner pulls the leg free, we just go and we catch either here at my partner's ankle or here at my partner's heel. And as she pulls that leg free, we just go into that same cowboy drill. We catch my partner's toes, we catch everything like so, and now we lock up. Now because we're belly up, we go into the same finishing mechanics we went into before. Okay. So we go through, we have leg lace in place. From here we start putting pressure on with the leg lace on our partner. So she falls to the correct hip for me to go into heel hooks. And now from here, her whole thing is gonna be to shorten that top leg. As she shortens the top leg, I allow the leg to come out. And now from here we either post or grab on our partner's ankle like so, or we can go to the heel like so. In the heat of the moment, you'll be able to see which one you can get to sooner. And then the main thing from here is we block our partner's toes here. So she goes to turn, she can't do it. So I catch the toes and we use that cowboy drill. We catch. And we lock up. And now from here, she tries to stay in this position, she gets broke. She tries to high leg over, we go belly down. She turns back and tries to heel slip this way. And again, the mechanics are the same as the outside heel hook. We take that elbow inside our partner's shin like so. We go belly down. We get a strong back heel, hips come up. Strong back heel, strong pinch. We take the toes down to my partner's butt. We take the heel up to my chin. And then we bridge, bottom shoulder. We get strong inverted heel hooks from a belly down position. Okay? So we go through. Attempted leg lace. It failed, but we get through on the correct hip for me to go into heel hooks. She shortens the leg. As she shortens the leg, no problem. Leg lace fails. Heel hook prevails. And now from here, we go in, we finish our partner wherever she chooses to go. Okay? So leg lace to inverted heel hook. All right, so now let's look at passing up on her secondary leg across to this hip by using a two on one ankle. There's many different ways we can pass, but if we can pass our partner's leg across to the hip and crisscross the legs like so, now we have the ability to expose both heels and you're in a much better shape here to actually go in and attack your partner. Because now she can't, much harder for her to free the secondary leg, much harder for her to go into a defensive role. Okay? So we go in here like so, and right from here, we're just going to go in against a, this will work on talented people, but if you start going to the highest, highest levels of leg lockers, you're going to have to use different gripping variations, but this worked on very good people as well. So I'm going to show it to you. From here, the first thing I want to do is I want to stop my partner from just pulling the leg free when I release the Achilles grip. So I take my heel to my partner's hip, and I back heel strongly so it controls her leg. As much as you have to pull out, it's a difficult thing from here. And that gives me the time now to switch to a grip, a V grip on my partner's ankle like so. Now I just quickly lay back. From here, I take a two on one on my partner's ankle, and I take my elbows together. When she gets to pull the foot free, the elbows coming together makes it hard. If my elbows are open, she pulls, I lose the grip. So a combination of the foot and the two on one. When she gets to pull the foot across, pull the foot out, it's difficult. Even if she gets to peel my foot, it takes time. That gives me enough time with my elbow position and my foot on the hip to stuff it across the body. And now I quickly sit up, and I grab my partner's knee. So now she has to peel the foot, she has to peel the knee, and she has to address the one on one. And now from here we just sit up, switch to an Achilles, and we control our partner's knee like so. Now we have our feet, our partner's legs, passed across in this crisscross, and we can go into attacks on one leg or the other. So we're in here, we have an Achilles grip, however it may be with our leg position. Right from here, we switch to a post on our partner's hip. We hit a strong back heel, and once she gets to pull that leg free, it's difficult. Even without the Achilles, she gets to peel the leg, it's difficult. And now we just go in, Achilles, we V-grip. We V-grip with a two on one, and we suck everything in and bring the elbows close. So once you have to pull the leg free, it's not easy. And now we pass it like so. Now I use that V-grip, I stuff it, and I quickly forward shift, I sit up to an Achilles. I grab my partner's knee, and now we've had to pass across with proper wedging the whole way through, and we can go into attacks on both legs on our partner from here. So another way we can expose our partner's primary leg while keeping the secondary leg trapped is by using a half Dracula. Now we call this the half and the double Dracula because this is how Dracula's supposed to sleep, so John calls it the double Dracula. So yeah, I don't know, he's called it that forever, so hopefully he'll still call that when you guys are watching this. But this is where the nomenclatures kind of get a little funky. But so in this position, we go in and we use what we call a half Dracula. We take our foot to our partner's hip like so, and now we reach over and we catch here. Now your partner's always going to be stripping his foot off the hip. This is like a guaranteed, if they know what's going on, they're always going to be fighting this foot. So usually I put this foot in place, and then I give them a battle to fight down here. So as they're going to strip this foot off, this hand's coming over like so, and we move into a situation where now we have an overhook on this side, and then we scoop our partner's leg with the left hand. And now we have a choice of either going double Dracula like so and controlling, looking to make a pass off, or a half Dracula with our right hand. Or from here, we expose that heel by bringing our knee up nice and high. And now if we can, we bring our partner down to the correct hip, and we use that cowboy drill to expose. If she forces me to the other hip, no problem. I just block the toes like so. I keep control over my partner's leg with that single Dracula, that half Dracula. And now from here, we just go into a belly down position with our head on the floor. We use that same reach back that we looked at before with the outside heel hook, and we catch. And we lock up. Once we lock up, we go right back in. We finish belly down, or if we're belly up and she rolls, we finish belly up or belly down on the opposite side. So we go in, we're here, foot comes to the hip. She goes to start peeling the foot off. As she's doing that, we reach and we catch. Now we go in and we transfer to a scoop grip on this side, and then we go in. Usually from here, we go to a double Dracula, and then we make a pass off to either passing leg across or using a single Dracula or half Dracula to go in and use that same cowboy drill. We shorten our leg, we expose her heel, and we catch. If she points me in this direction, she starts hiding the heel, it's okay. Post on the forehead. I reach around, touch my under ribcage, and catch. Now we go in. I'm ready to break with our partner, either be foot to foot, either be full triangle, both are very good from here. She goes to start turning over, we go full triangle from here. She goes belly down on the opposite side, we go full triangle here. And then we finish belly down on the opposite side. So half Dracula to the inverted heel hook, controlling our partner's secondary leg. All right, so now let's look at going to a double Dracula, and instead of switching to a half Dracula to expose our partner's heel, how we can pass our partner's leg across once we get to the double Dracula. Okay, so we move in here. We bring the foot up, she's trying to fight the foot. From here we go into an over wrap, like so. We switch to a scoop grip like so, and then we shelf our partner's leg up like so. We have this double Dracula position. Now we can relinquish one and go to the leg. We can also look to pass our partner's leg off to the opposite side. When I see this, we're just going to go back and we're going to start leaning back like so. As we go to lean back, we're again, we're going to take our foot and we're going to place it back here on our partner's hip. She's always going to be fighting that foot, but that's okay. All I need is a half a second or so to pass the leg across. Then we go in, we take the leg through, and now from here, as we lean back, just we look into a create extension the whole time. She's looking to pull the leg free obviously, and pull her knee back. So I create this tension where I initially catch, and then there's tension pulling my partner's leg towards me. Just as the heel slips on by, past the shoulders, we just catch like so, right here at my partner's heel. So we have a wedge here, we control our partner's leg, and now from here, we just start looking to our right, to the side we want to pass the leg to. We start falling back, and just as the heel passes, we take it across. We switch to a V grip. We immediately stuff it, we catch our partner's knee, now we come forward, and we use that Achilles grip to control our partner's leg on the other side. We make the switch to a double dracula. We won't be sitting, we'll be in a situation like this, where I'm looking to make my pass off, we're going in, we're trying to heal our partner, we're threatening Achilles, whatever the case is, and then I forward shift, and I switch. We switch to double dracula, and from here, we start falling back. As we fall, we look over the shoulder. Once that foot passes, we take it across. We go V grip on the ankle. When she goes to pull everything back in, it's hard because even if she peels the foot with this V grip, and this now new grip I have over my partner's heel, this false grip, when she goes to pull that foot out, it's not going to be an easy task. Now from here, all I have to do is quickly sit up, forward shift, grab the knee, switch to an Achilles. Using a double dracula to pass your partner's leg off to the opposite side, and then expose your partner's heel once you do that. Once we have our partner's leg passed across here, we can look to expose both of our partner's heels. Now ultimately, I want to expose the heel of the primary leg because this is the leg that my Ashi garami controls. I'm going to get much stronger breaks on this leg. Ultimately, my strategy from here is what I'll start to do is I'll control this leg as I pass it across, and I'll start by attacking this leg. The only way my partner can stop me from exposing this heel and breaking her leg, I can break her leg from here because she can't roll out. In order for her to stop me from exposing this heel, she has to start tilting over to her left hip. Now this makes it hard to expose this heel. The second I see this, we just switch back, and we expose the heel we really wanted all along. Your partner's in a dilemma. If she stops you from exposing the primary leg heel, she will always in turn expose the secondary leg heel. Now I just fire my leg up, I can even fire my leg across, and we can go in, and we can get strong breaks here on our partner's secondary leg because you can then entangle your legs into hers. The strongest break is always going to be on this primary leg here. Once I pass the leg across, I always play a game where I grab my partner's knee with a false grip, and I look to start pulling my elbow to my own hip. So I expose my partner's secondary heel. From here, when she goes to hide that by heel slipping, we switch back to an Achilles grip to control the secondary leg so we don't lose it. Then right from here, we pull this leg in. I make it look like I'm going to attack my partner's secondary leg. When she goes to hide, we quickly go in with that same cowboy drill, and we catch. Now from here, we lock up, and we're ready to go. She goes belly up, we finish. She goes belly down, we finish. We use the threat of secondary leg exposure to expose the primary leg heel. Okay, so now we looked at it before. If we have this cross ashi situation, my partner pulled her primary leg out. Before I pass the leg, we have a Rimi ashi garami on the opposite leg. Once we pass the leg across, however we may do it, and from here, I feel my partner's primary leg is slipping out. Whenever I see that, I just hold my partner's secondary leg like so. What you do is to heist out. You pull that leg free, and from here, we just step physically on our partner's hamstring like so. If she comes up to her knee and she heists, then we just go into the inversion we looked at before where we throw the leg over and follow our partner through. Most of the time, she's just trying to scoot away on her butt or repowel her legs, whatever she's looking to do from there. From here, we just host on our partner's hamstring, and we move to stretch ashi. Do this on the other side. Just post in like so. You can also do this with scoop grip variations. If you start with a scoop grip. We had an Achilles, or we moved to an Achilles, so from here, we just move over here to stretch ashi. When she goes to start pommeling from here, my whole thing is to control the space between my partner's knees. What I want is to extend my body away like so and push my partner's far knee so I can control the space between the knees. Now when she goes to pommel, it's a difficult thing. Now we just take our free leg and we fire it up and over. As we fire up and over, we pull ourself hip to hip like so. Now we have cross ashi on the opposite leg where we can go into digging the heel, or we can control our partner's secondary leg on the opposite side. Whenever we see my partner takes that leg out, from here, we immediately just step on my partner's hamstring and we extend everything out and away. When she goes to mitigate the space between her knees, it's just not going to happen from here. Now you have a perfect choice of going in and starting to fire yourself into a cross ashi Garami situation. You can also use this if you didn't pass the leg across like we did in this situation to go back to a Rimi ashi Garami, or you can fire your leg over and go to inside ashi Garami and go for outside heel looks like so. There's many options we have from here. If you go in here and cross ashi, she frees the leg. If you didn't pass the leg across, we have a Rimi ashi Garami. We have outside ashi Garami. We have inside ashi Garami. We can move fluidly through these transitions. If you feel that from here, you're good enough to go in, shelf your partner's leg, and you manage to pass it across. Now she frees the leg. Now we can go in and we can feed the cross ashi Garami. We can feed the 50-50. We can feed crisscross ashi Garami topside. We can feed crisscross ashi Garami bottomside. We can go to many different ashi Garami variations from here. The main thing is as your partner goes to pull that leg free, regardless of where it is, you get in the habit of switching from primary leg to secondary leg. If you miss the secondary leg coming up, heisting on top and at least getting top position if that's what you want to do from there. There's many different variations where we can lose one leg and switch off to another ashi Garami on our partner's secondary leg. Now let's look at exposing our partner's heel when we don't have control over our partner's secondary leg. I don't mean... Back this way. I don't mean we shelf the leg, we go to a Dracula and then we control. I don't mean passing it across. I mean we have an Achilles and from here we just relinquish the secondary leg or she frees it without me wanting her to. Now from here I have to go in and follow her leg. From here the first thing I want to do is I want to take a strong grip on my partner's knee like so. I want to pull the knee open and pull my right elbow back to my own hip. Then my whole thing from here is to block the toes. If she can get her shoelaces to point towards the floor, she can start going into rolls, she can go into back kicks, she can do all kinds of things. My whole thing is I want to block the toes. Even if I don't have a grip on the heel and she goes into a full roll from here, she tries to free herself, I always emerge on the other side with the ability to trap my partner's heel and go into bricks. So the first thing when I see that secondary leg come out is to block my partner's toes from moving out and away. Sometimes she's crossing her feet real strong so we can go in, we can elbow slide through and separate our partner's legs. Sometimes we have an Achilles and from here we try to make this switch and she pulls the leg out and I have to go. Or sometimes I'm not even ready yet and she just kicks the leg forwards and backwards and she pulls the leg out and it slips. Whenever I see this, it's always in my best interest to go from, again, that full figure of four to just back to cross Ashi. Or from here we go in with open feet and we go foot to foot and we bring our knee up to make it hard for my partner to hide her heel in towards my hip. And now from here we just block our partner's toes. If she's not turning or doing anything, then she just gets heel hooked right from here, we go in, we go into our belly down finishes. More than likely she's going to be trying the best she can to explosively roll out and away from me. So I block the toes here. When she goes to roll, we just touch our own ribcage once again. And as we emerge, we have that strong grip ready to go in and break our partner with an inverted heel hook. So we lose that secondary leg. The second we lose the secondary leg, she goes to explosively roll through. We emerge on the other side, we have a strong grip on the heel hook, and we're ready to go in. And this all comes back to, you've noticed, that one cowboy drill. We're just going in and we catch and we catch. We circle and we catch. We circle and we catch. It's all about the mechanics of having precision with the grip with your hands to go in, catch, and then lock up as your partner goes to escape. What? All right, so now let's look to move to a shoelace ashi. A shoelace ashi is a great way to control your partner's near side leg better than you would be able to with just a cross ashi or an inside tenkaku. We usually feed into a shoelace ashi by putting heat on our partner with an achilles, with a figure four achilles, with a reverse figure four achilles. And from here she raises the hips and I just tuck myself into a shoelace ashi like so. In addition, if you're trying to heist on top of your partner and get to top position, an inside tenkaku makes it hard because your own leg blocks you. The shoelace ashi is nothing wedging you in place and it makes heisting on top much easier. So if you're looking at competing in like IBJJF tournaments, for example, and we'll go into this more in different instructionals, and you're looking to heist, switch to a shoelace ashi first because the heist is a lot easier. If I try to heist from here, my leg is in my own way. It's hard for me to heist. From here, a heist is easy. It makes it easier to heist and it gives you far more control over your partner's near side leg, your partner's primary leg. So we switch to shoelace ashi usually. If we're in cross ashi already, sometimes if you're inverting and entering in from bottom position, you can switch to shoelace ashi as you land. But if we're already here, I have to start putting heat on my partner's secondary leg to get her to raise her hips to some degree. So I can switch off and we can get on to shoelace ashi. Now once the secondary leg comes out, you can still do all the things we looked at before. We can pass it across, we can do all these things we did before. So that all remains the same. Let's say I lose the secondary leg. Because I control my partner's primary leg much better now, when she goes to roll, it's a pretty easy thing for me to flex my shoelaces up against my partner's hip on this side and to open up my knees. So when she goes to roll explosively in this direction, I'm not going to say it's impossible to roll. Your partner can roll from here, but it's going to be delayed. It's going to be much easier for you to follow that roll because your partner now is carrying body weight and you have a much better wedge around your partner's near side, your partner's primary leg and hip. So from here, we just go in and we grab our partner's heel like so. When she goes to start rolling, we post our forehead. And many times from here, we can just take our hips forward and use that cowboy drill to go in and catch our partner's heel and actually finish our partner without having her roll through. Okay? So many times when she goes to roll, the forehead stops her. She has to explosively roll. It's not easy. The heel comes up, I'm throwing my hips in, I open up the knee and we catch. Then we fall back. From here, we're ready to go. Now, if she goes to roll, the shoelace ashi does a much better job of slowing her roll down and forcing her to roll on your pace. Now, from here, we go in. As she goes to explosively roll, she's carrying body weight. That makes the catch and the break much easier. Now, from here, if we end the belly up, we finish. If we end the belly down, we finish. Okay? So transitioning to shoelace ashi and putting heat on your partner with Achilles grips or doing anything that you have to to make her raise the hips and then using the shoelace ashi to either pass a secondary leg and you do all the things we looked at previously or if we lose the secondary leg, the primary leg is much better controlled. Her roll now is a lot slower and a lot more labored because you have better wedging and she's carrying more body weight. Okay? Then as you emerge on the other side, you touch your own rib cage or you use the cowboy drill depending on how far she's worked into an escape and then we land, lock the hands and go into a belly up or belly down finish. All right. So now let's look at going from a shoelace ashi into a heist where we can transition either into passes or back to leg locks or move ourselves around a little bit from a tapo shiro position. So like I said, it's much easier to heist from here. So when I see I'm in the shoelace ashi, maybe I have too much resistance at the lower body. Maybe I'm not going to be able to leg lock my partner because she knows that I'm only focusing on impacts of the legs. I can always look to elect to come up and heist from here and the way that I heist from here while still controlling my partner's secondary leg is by leaning over my left elbow like so and as I lean, I just thrust my hips forward and we just go in and we lean forward and we start heisting into this position. The only way your partner can stop you from heisting is by aggressively circling this way and forcing yourself to her left hip. So as I try to lean to my left, she circles in the opposite way and now from here she starts sitting me back down and it's hard for me to heist. But the second your partner starts to fall down to her left hip, her heel will always naturally be exposed. So I play a dilemma game trying to heist. If my partner falls to her right hip and allows the heist, now I'm on top. If she falls to her left hip and doesn't allow me to heist, she exposes her own heel to some degree and you can play it back and forth between those two. I can also, for example, if I want to heist, I release the secondary leg but I still control at the knee and now I go in and I threaten going for an attack. When she starts to fall to her right hip, now we just come up and heist on top of my partner. So we play a dilemma game between heisting and between exposing my partner's heel. She can't stop both. She has two hips, she has to pick one. If she falls to her left hip in this case, she exposes the heel. She falls to the right hip, she allows me to heist. So this is the basic dilemma game from here. Now I have a great choice from here. We can go down and we can start heisting. We can start going into passes obviously. Many times from here, because you're leaning forward on your partner, your partner won't take the leg entanglement seriously anymore. A lot of stuff starts opening up in the upper body and the lower body. She's worried about kimuras. She's worried about underhooks. She's worried about leg attacks. There's a lot going on here. I'm not attacking specifically one part of my partner's body. I'm generalized across the whole body. So from here, as I go into the upper body, maybe she tucks her hands in. She makes it hard for me to enter into the upper body. And now from here, we can go back through. We can catch our partner's knee and we can start to expose our partner's heel again, where we can either catch or now her legs have become unlocked. She's trying to bridge. She's trying to move me around. Now from here, we can go through, we can roll, we can catch our partner's heel. So we're up here. She has her legs locked initially. She's ready to go in. But now I start guard passing. I start going here. I start threatening kimuras from here. My partner now starts unlocking the legs, bringing them in towards, and she starts trying to bridge and starts trying to off balance me. And from here, I go back and I quickly fall back into my partner's legs. Then we can go into attacks from there. So we can play this dilemma game where I heist into a tapo shiro. And instead of actually playing just on my partner's legs, we can start threatening kimuras, threatening guard passes, threatening other things. So my partner's focus now is moved to the upper body and then I can go back to the lower body. Okay. In addition, we can do things like taking our knee to the inside like so. We can start hugging our partner's second leg and then we can switch to a scoop grip on the outside of our partner's primary leg. And now we can start falling across, going back into those knee bars that we like so much. Okay. So instead of going into heel hooks, maybe heel hooks aren't allowed, whatever the case is, we can use a shu lai sashi to heist up, threaten the upper body, and then fall to the same toe hold knee bar dilemma we looked at before. Okay. So a lot of different options from here we have. We start the shu lai sashi and now we start playing a game where we try to heist up. If at any point my partner denies me the heist, she will always expose her own leg. This is always better if we have this passed across because now there's nothing stopping me. I still have control of the secondary leg and there's nothing between her leg and mine. So from here, if I want to heist, I'll threaten my partner's foot on this side. I'll start trying to expose it. As she goes to hide it, she pulls me into a heist. I try to heist and she starts scooting around the corner. Now she exposes her own heel. We go in and we can break her here. Okay. So we play this to allow. Now as I heist, we have many different options from here. We can go in, we can start guard passing. We can release the secondary leg. We can keep the secondary leg. We can do all kinds of things from here. We can split the legs. We can go back to her legs. We can take our knee to the inside position. We can control two legs and we can fall on top of the secondary leg and switch our legs. We can go in. We can start going in for knee bars. We can start going for toe holds. We can do all kinds of things from here. Okay. So getting in the habit of using a dilemma between positional play where we heist on top and threaten upper body, either positions with guard passing or submissions with kumars, things like that. And then we play between upper body attacks and lower body attacks from this topo shiro position, which all starts from heisting on top with the shule sashi and using a dilemma game between heisting on top of your partner. If they deny that, they expose the heel. If they, uh, if you try to expose the heel and they deny that, you can always heist on top and you can play these back and forth with one another and create dilemmas and trilemmas based upon your partner's reactions. All right. So now let's look at, we lose a secondary leg. We try to dig for the heel, but we feel like it's just not there. If my partner can point her shoelaces as she goes to roll to the floor and I'm not blocking the toes and we end up in a double inverted position where she's facing down and I'm also facing belly down, she can grab my hip, she can misdirect and she can take my back. Made famous obviously by Felipe Pena against myself. He hit it on me twice. Um, it's a great move and if you time it right, it can actually be very, very effective. So if she lets her start rolling and I overcommit to the heel hook and from here she points her shoelaces at the floor and I'm digging for the heel hook and we're both inverted. She can grab my hip, she can misdirect and now my back's exposed. This is no good. Whenever I see the heel hook is not there and not only the heel hook is not there, but I'm not controlling my partner's toes, the direction of what your toes point. You don't want to end up in a double inverted position where her shoelaces are pointing or pointing towards the floor. You're both inverted and you don't have any control of the toes and you don't have an Achilles strip. This is kind of a sensitivity thing as well. You'll do this enough times and you'll be like, okay, when I go for the heel hook, it's either there or it's not going to be there. And you know, after doing it a thousand times, it's not going to be there. If you see the heel hook is not there, don't create back exposure by going into a double inverted position. Mitigate the back exposure and deny her back exposure by using an Achilles grip. If we go belly down, she can point her shoelaces to the floor all she wants. She can force me into a double inverted position all she wants. When she goes to hit a misdirectional, she can't. She'll break her own leg because the leg is trapped. There's no ability to move it here. The only time I've ever seen a misdirectional work against a strong Achilles grip is when someone is heavily greased. Okay, because then there's just so little friction that a lot of times they can still move their leg back. But the Achilles grip under fair rules and even if there is grease and you have proper mechanics, it'll do a lot to stop a misdirectional escape. Okay. Whenever I see I lose my partner and from here she goes to hit a misdirectional, it's just not going to work. You have control over the end of the lever. If I'm just trying to heel hook my partner, there's no control over the bottom portion of the leg. So when she goes to misdirect, she just turns the toes and now I'm getting my back taken. So there has to be a key switch here where I go from attacking a heel hook to deny my partner back exposure. So we release the secondary leg. Let's say we're just a little bit short and she's trying to dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. It's like I can't get it. Right from here, I have to switch to an Achilles. When she goes to misdirect now, she can't. And now we can roll all the way through. There's no more back exposure. I start over either with digging for the heel or coming forward, take that secondary leg and controlling my partner. There has to be a switch. You can always feel, if you've done this many times, you can always feel if you're going to be able to either catch the heel or at least control the toes because there's no back exposure. If I control my partner's toes, even if I don't have a grip on the heel hook yet and she goes to roll and we end up double inverted, if she goes to misdirect here, she can't. If she goes to sit, she'll actually fall back into a heel hook. Got to sit slowly. She'll actually fall back into a heel hook from here. The misdirectional only works when your shoelaces are pointing towards the floor and the offensive man has no control over where your toes point. So for her, if she can achieve that, there's back exposure. The second she achieves that, I'm digging for the heel, I switch to an Achilles. Now she goes to misdirect, she can't. Now we can forward shift, come back up, go into all of our attacks on the other side. So we mitigate the back exposure. We deny her back exposure by switching to an Achilles grip off of our initial dig. When our partner goes belly down, you don't want to find yourself in double inverted position, but you have no control over the directionality of your partner's toes without an Achilles grip. Always when in doubt, switch back to an Achilles grip, roll your partner through and then be comfortable on the other side instead of getting your back taken in the finals of ADCC and then losing the absolute. All right, so this is a scenario that you guys saw in my first Vinny match in 2018 where he forced me into a double inversion. We're both facing belly down and he didn't try to misdirect, he didn't try to roll through. He just put weight back on top of me. Nikki Rod actually tried this from 50-50 in the Fight Pass Invitational as well and I used the same counter to roll him through with an Achilles grip. So in the Vinny match, we ended up double inverted from 50-50 where he went to roll belly down and I fell into this position. Now if he's on his knee from here, I can put enough pressure to break him. The problem is when he popped up to his foot, he started pushing weight back into me. From here, there just wasn't enough power to break him and wasn't enough power again to turn belly up to actually go into a finish from here. I got caught in this position where I went back and forth between facing belly up, which I couldn't really break him, but a lot of the time, go back, a lot of the time, I was here and he was pushing back into me and I was getting a grip, but I just couldn't break him from here. We were both inverted and I couldn't get anything going either from an inverted position or from here. There's just so much weight on me that I just, I feel like I couldn't get enough to actually break him. I popped him a few times, but I couldn't roll him through and I couldn't break him. Whenever I see this, using the Achilles grip does two things. It allows me one, to not get my back taken, most important, and number two, to roll my partner through. When she goes to go into this inverted position and using Achilles grip, like so, I lock up. Now from here, my elbow comes in, I tuck my elbow back to my hip. When she tries to stop me from rolling through, we just take our two heels to our butt and now as our left heel comes down towards the floor, we just point our knees in this direction. When she goes to stop me from rolling her through, she can base that all she wants, she can push back all she wants, it means nothing. We can always use the Achilles grip and the directionality of force of the knees to roll our partner through and get him back belly up. So we go in, she goes to start rolling, we have an Achilles grip. As we go to start rolling, we use an Achilles grip from this double inversion to point our knees out towards the camera. Left elbow tucks to the left hip. When she goes to stop me from rolling her through, my heels come to my butt, my left heel drives towards the floor. Hips come forward, knees point. She goes to stop me and resist. She always gets taken over and now from here, we can go in, we're both belly up and go into digging the heel, controlling the second leg, going into attacks from there. We use this Achilles grip to stop our partner from exposing our back and from forcing us into a double inverted position where she can put weight on us and you don't have enough proper mechanics to break your partner because there's too much weight on you, there's not body weight involved and she's pushing weight back into you. She goes to stay in a double inverted position. I'm here, I'm trying to dig. I get a grip, but I just can't break. No problem. Now we're belly up, ready to go in and ready to finish. Now let's look at my partner goes to go into a defensive roll and we're going to use the initial Achilles grip to mitigate the back exposure and to transfer into backside 50-50, which we're going to cover in depth when we go into 50-50, but this is a good transition to go into backside 50-50 and then to switch into cross waist 50-50 to go into crisscross Ashi. There's a ton of different options we have from here. Let's take a look at that. We go in here. My partner goes to go into a defensive roll. The second she goes to go move into a defensive roll, I want to immediately take my foot and I want to catch my partner's far kneecap, right behind my partner's far kneecap with my foot like so. From here I can, number one, control the distance between her knees and number two, make it hard for her to roll as fast and as explosively as she wants to. As she goes to roll, I slow the roll down like so and from here we make space between the knees for our left leg to fit through and catch my partner's far hip like so. So when she goes to explosively move away from me, both legs are controlled now. One through my Ashi Grami, one through my shoelaces. And now we're in a backside 50-50. We can move. Here we're in a backside 50-50 and you can choose to lock your legs as you want. What I recommend, moving to a double 50 where I control both my partner's legs with my legs and we'll go into this more as we go. But from here, when she goes to roll, she rolls this way, she gets broke. If she tries to roll that way, it takes her a second because she can't high leg. She has to strip my grip first before she can high leg and that takes time. So we transition to a backside 50 and it moves to a double 50 and now we can break our partner and we'll go into all these mechanics and everything later. If your partner does manage to backstep, then you go to a crisscross Ashi, a bottom side crisscross Ashi. Or, your partner goes to backstep, then from here, go back, we get a far waist 50-50. Now we can break our partner from here. So there's many different options we're going to look at from a backside 50-50 and from 50-50 when we move into that situation. But just understand that you can transition from a cross Ashi to a backside 50, a crisscross Ashi to a far waist 50-50 or to a cross waist 50-50 off of this initial Achilles grip when your partner goes to roll out. So you feel like the heel hook's not going to be there, we go to Achilles grip. When she goes to roll, I extend my leg towards my partner's knee, I tuck my other heel towards my butt. That makes the roll easy. So now from here, we can transition and exploit the space between my partner's knees by feeding my shoelaces to my partner's far hip. Rotate your head towards the camera. Posture. No, no, posture. This is what I want. This left leg here, the shoelaces control my partner's hip. So now when she goes to explosively move away from me, her right hip is controlled. And now we have a choice. I'm going to double 50, control my partner's leg like so. If my partner goes to high step over and she beats my leg, we go to crisscross Ashi and we break. We go to cross waist and we break. There's many different options we have from here. We use this initial Achilles grip off of a standard cross Ashi garami and as she goes to roll, we palm the legs into a backside 50-50, double 50, and we go, depending on how my partner works, we go into heel hooks from crisscross, from far hip, or from cross waist, and then we go into our finishes from there. So many different options, many different pommeling options off of this initial Achilles grip and feeding into the initial backside 50-50. All right, so when all fails and I feel like I'm just losing my partner, I'm not going to be able to switch to an Achilles, I'm not going to be able to get a heel hook, whatever the case is, we're in cross Ashi. I try to go for the heel hook and sometimes you feel like you're even too late to lock an Achilles grip and you don't want to follow your partner because it's back exposure and you want to just disentangle your legs because then you just end up back neutral. Whenever I see I'm too late to lock an Achilles in my partner's primary leg or to get a heel hook, we just go in and we go center chest. Whether we use it from a secondary leg trap where I know it's going to be hard to actually expose my partner's heel and we just start lifting and as we release, we grab our partner's toes or when they're trying to go in and heel hook my partner and we feel like we're failing and we just go in and we grab our partner's toes like so. From this position, there's a couple different grips we can use. The first thing is I have to control my partner's toes. So usually what I do is I catch over my partner's toes like so and we use a tombstone grip where we just come in and we reinforce the hand with our own elbow. We call this a tombstone grip because when people are mummified, they're usually in this posture like so. We just come across and we use this tombstone grip. So my partner goes to roll. She can't do it because she can't turn the toes in the correct direction. My hips come forward and we just use this initial tombstone grip like so. If she goes to roll, she breaks her own leg. She can't do it because her toes are glued to my chest like so. And now from here, we can start making passes where we take a grip like so. We switch. We can grab our partner's heel. And now from here, we can forward shift and start going into heel hooks. So whether we use a full tombstone like so, my partner goes to roll, she can't do so. Or as we go in, start switching the grips where I have a grip on my partner's heel and a grip over my partner's toes. Now when she goes to roll from here, it's a very difficult thing as well. But when I have it center chest, the center of my chest and my center line, now I have the choice of either forward shifting and going into inverted heel hooks or passing across to inside ashi. Both are good options. And in the intermediary steps between them, you have very good control over your partner's legs. So if I'm losing my partner's legs, I'm trying to go for the heel hook, we go and we catch. The whole thing is heel gets glued to my ribcage first, pinky toe comes to my ribcage second, my chest second. When she goes to roll, hips come forward. I just keep this position here. Now if she's pointing the toes, it's going to be a little bit harder now to control my partner. So from here, we reinforce it. She goes to turn, just not going to happen from here. Or we know it's going to be hard for me to catch the heel in the first place. So we go through and right as we release, we catch. And now we play here. Now if her toes are in like so and she has her foot booted, it's easy to control them. When she starts pointing the toes, she starts angling her hips out this way. Now you start losing the heel. And now she can start turning and rotating and this is no good. So whenever I see this, I reinforce it. She goes to start scooting out now and turning, not going to happen. Now we take it fully center chest like so. We don't want to get our legs repummeled. So we always make sure we have good leg position, whether it be with a triangle, whether it be foot over foot. I usually go triangle from here because foot over foot is easier to separate because you don't have a reinforced wedge. I usually go in and I triangle my legs. So when she goes to repummel her legs, she can't do it. And now from here, we go in, we catch. Whether we catch here and here or whether we stay here. This is better for control. This is better to make a pass off to a heel lock. If we can use either grip, both are very good. The main thing is take it center chest, control your partner and then decide what you're going to do. Not just lose them or get your back exposed because you can't lock an Achilles grip. Have you ever had an itchy spot? Hold on, forward shift to invert a heel lock. Have you ever had an itchy spot that you itch but it's just not doing anything, it's still itching? You know what I'm saying? Like it feels like it's itching here, right? For example, right now. But no matter how much I itch, it feels like it's not touching what is itching actually. You have to scratch it till it bleeds. No, no, no. It doesn't reach. Yeah, it feels like you're itchy there but then it's a different spot. It's just not there. Tell them about the story about the time when you wanted to get ringworm. I love you, Tyler. I never, okay, I never got it. Has she ever had any skin diseases? No, because in Brazil we don't get this bullshit. And she's like, man, she's like, I don't know. I feel like when you have an itch and you scratch it, it feels so good. I'm like, yeah. She's like, I really want to get ringworm one day. I'm like, no, you don't. She's like, no, no, I want to. She's like, I don't know. It just feels so satisfying when you have an itch and you scratch it and it finally goes away. I'm like, yeah, but ringworm doesn't go away. Like you're just itchy. It's just itchy all the time and you scratch it, then it bleeds and it hurts. It's still itchy. It's like terrible. She's like, no, no, I can't wait. So then one day she's like, it was not like that. The next day she's like, Gordon, I'm like, watch, she's like, come here, come here. Quick look. I'm like, what? And she's like all excited. She like points to a little dot on her forearm. She's like, is that ringworm? It's itchy. Can you get ringworm? I'm like, uh, it's too early to tell. Like it just starts like a little pimple. I'm like, next day goes by and then you see like the little spots and it starts to form a ring. She's like, I don't know. I've been really itchy. I'm like, yeah, I got ringworm. I'm like, we got to put cream on it. She's like, no, I'm going to let it go for a few days. I want to feel what it's like. I'm like, I'm telling you it's good. Like once it gets big, it's hard to get rid of. Like it takes, it takes a long time. It's like a few days goes by and it like grows to like, it's not as like half of a, like maybe like a dime or like maybe a little bit smaller. And then she goes, Gordon, like what? She's like, this is no fun. She's like, I need, I got to get rid of this. I can't stop itching it. I'm like, I told you this was going to happen. I'm like, but now it's already like a form, like a full ringworm. It's going to take like a couple of weeks to go away. She's like, she's like, Gordon, I got to get rid of it today. I'm like, I, I'm like, I can't do that. Like you got to start putting cream on it. Like I told you to do this like three days ago. It would have just went away instantly. She's like, Oh, what do I do? She's like, I can't stop itching. I'm like, just that's, that's what it is. I told you not to get it. She's like, Oh, this is a big mistake. I never want this again. I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate all this med disease you guys give to me. I hate them all. Anyways. So now we're going to be looking at a forward shift into an inverted heel up, just the directionality of force and the mechanics on this. So I'm looking to forward shift into a heel up. If I go with the initial full tombstone grip, let's look at how we can forward shift off of this. Okay. First of all, I want to have my legs in good position. I want to pull my heels to my butt and then shoot my legs away. Almost like I'm doing almost like I would do in a, in a butterfly guard. If someone flattens me out and I want to lift them and go into simagesis, it's always a pull first where I pull my partner towards me and then I forward shift out and away. Okay. Same thing here. And once I'm here, I pull my heels to my butt. I pull my knees into my chest slightly and then I forward shift up and away like so. As I forward shift, I shift my partner's toes into my armpit. And then finally we use that same cowboy drill to catch. She goes to turn out. I have her controlled. It's hard. And now we forward shift. We catch, we release and we break. Catch. I'm ready to go. If we have a grip on our partner's heel, like so, so we go in, we initially catch and then we make a switch one, two. Now as we forward shift, we're looking to expose our partner's heel by lifting the left elbow and pulling with the right elbow. And we go in and we break. Okay. So forward shifting and right off the forward shift, we sit up, we catch the toes in the armpit so my partner can't go into a defensive role, we lock up and we go into our breaks. So once we have the heel look, it's very common for my partner to try to do a high leg and hit a big explosive roll out of the heel look. So once she realizes she can't heel slip because the hands are high, a lot of people try to roll in this direction and roll through it, which if she does, she still gets broken belly down on the opposite side, but she can at least create motion towards an escape. What I'm trying to do is hold her in a static position long enough to hit a catastrophic break. Remember, motion is the enemy of strong submission mechanics. If your partner can create motion towards an escape, you can break them, but it's much easier to hold them in a static position while you break them. So from here, once we forward shift, we go in. The second my partner goes to go into a strong defensive role, we just catch a far hip position where I physically catch my partner's far hip with my leg and now we start back heeling and we take the hips off the floor. So as my partner goes into a defensive role, she gets caught in this position and now from here my legs open. So I have a strong back heel, my knees splay open so that my hips are, she's supporting all the weight of my hips. When she goes to high leg as hard as she can and roll, it's just not going to happen. She's getting held now in a static position while you catastrophically break her with the belly up finish. So from here, we go in. However we get to the heel hook, my partner wants to go into a defensive role and create motion towards an escape. Motion towards an escape is never good. So one thing you can do from here, if she tries to heel slip, she can't do it, she goes into a defensive role. I pull my knee to my chest and I just fire right over the hip. She goes to high leg through and as she goes to high leg we splay the knees. And then again it's always hands high and then knees splayed. My right knee now points out to my left. My left elbow opens right up and over my head and as the hips come forward, I'm going to get strong finishes with far hip bashi to stop my partner rolling through. So now we're going to go into inside ashi. We feel like an inverted heel hook just isn't really something that I'm confident that I can hit on the person that I'm training with or competing against or whatever the case is. They have a really good ability to hide the heel, to roll out, to create back exposure and you try it maybe a few times and it's just not working. This is why it's important to have good outside mechanics as well as good inside mechanics. So we start off in cross ashi. We take everything center chest. Whether we're in here like so, whether we're in here like so, we want to look to start passing it across. From this position, I'm going to look to go in and take a V grip on my partner's ankle like so. And now I just look to start bridging and raising my partner's heel above the line of my chest and body. If she's looking to start turning and back heeling, she's going to be looking to start tucking her heel in towards my hips so that I can't sit up and go into a heel hook. So I have to start raising the leg. The way that I raise the leg from here is by just hitting a quick bridge or a two feet post and I raise my hips. So when she goes to tuck her leg and hide it on this side, I can always go in and make a pass off. Whether it be here or whether it be here. And now from here, once I pass it, my whole thing is I immediately just sit up and try to go in and expose my partner's heel. From this position, I need to make sure that my partner's knee stays trapped. So I take my right knee and I close it towards my left. That when she goes to start rolling in this direction, it's a difficult thing. She wants to roll in this direction because she can't heel slip from this leg position. She tries to heel slip from here. It's the easiest thing to just point my knees and expose my partner's heel. So I know that she's going to be trying to roll in this direction. So when she does, I point my ashi garami in the opposite direction. So I take my right knee and I point towards my left. When she tries to turn to her left to go into a defensive roll, it's not going to be easy. And now from here, we just quickly go in. We hit a forward shift. We expose our partner's heel like so. If she tries to hide her heel, we just point our knees in the opposite direction. And now from here, you can easily go in, expose my partner's heel, that cowboy drill, take everything up nice and high. And now from here, we're ready to go in and start breaking. Right from here, if she doesn't go into a defensive roll, and we just go in belly down, same mechanics apply. Back heeling, knees pinching, toes to butt, heel to chin, and then a bridge over the bottom shoulder for a strong win from inside ashi. So we transfer over to inside ashi. We hit a forward shift. We expose the heel. We make sure our partner's knee stays trapped. Your partner is probably going to go to a defensive roll, which we're going to cover in a second. If they don't, then you just fall into a belly down position from inside ashi and break them with the same mechanics as we were using from an outside ashi. So now we go into inside ashi, and there are many other ways to move into inside ashi. Like I just talked about a little bit before, just before we go into this, you can feed into inside ashi from a stretch ashi like so, where we feed to the inside. You can feed into inside ashi from an imiri ashi garami, where I just simply open up my partner's foreleg and I feed my legs to the inside position. You can feed into an inside ashi from an initial outside ashi garami, where from here we go and we post, and now as we go into a post ashi, we transition to an imiri ashi garami and we make space for our leg to come through. So there's not just one way to feed into inside ashi from a cross ashi. There's many different ways you can find yourself here. If you actually look at my match against Pedro Mourinho in 2019 ADCC, the first round of the absolute, I actually do it from standing position, where he's standing up over me, I go to off balance in this way, and then from here I go in and I actually cross my legs into an inside ashi and then roll them through and I finish him in inside ashi, which is what we're going to do right now. So there's a lot of tape study on this as well. So we end up in an inside ashi, however it may be, from here, if your partner does nothing, you just fall belly down and you break her. So the second you go in to start exposing your partner's heel, she knows she can't turn back into you this way because she's just going to get broken, and because of the leg configuration it's hard for her to even turn in this direction. So she is mostly inclined to move in this direction. So as she goes to explosively move out in that direction, there's two options. Number one is from here. If your partner allows you to stay hooked behind her leg, you'll roll all the way through and you'll use the same single roll theory like that before, and you'll land back in inside ashi and you'll just end up breaking your partner off the single roll as you end up in inside ashi, back in the opposite side. With more talented players, what they're going to do is they won't allow you to stay hooked behind the leg. So they'll clear the leg as you go. So from here, we roll through. So instead of me hooking the leg, as we get her to roll through, she won't even pose with the hand. She'll just pommel the leg. So from here, we end up in an outside ashi, and now we end up with a single roll theory anyways. We finish with an outside ashi where we can go in and break our partner. So whether she uses a hand assist or whether we just roll through and she just pommels the leg out. It doesn't really make a difference. We either end up in an inside ashi if she's naive, or we end up in an outside ashi. If she's naive, the reason why I say if she's naive, because if we end up in an inside ashi, and we end up here, she's getting broken and she can't come forward and heel slip. If she ends up in an outside ashi, now she has a chance to heel slip. So it's in her best interest to force me to an outside ashi, not stay in an inside ashi. So she goes to roll through, she beats me on the pommel. As we go to roll through, we end up with an outside ashi, and now from here, we're ready to go in and break. So you follow her roll through, and we end up in inside or outside ashi. The biggest thing that people ask me from this position is how do I lose my partner's knee? How do I keep losing my partner's knee? As we go to roll through, it's all about that left knee chasing the floor, just like outside ashi. You see a lot of people, they go to start rolling their partner through, the person steps the leg up, and the knee comes out. This is no good. Just like with outside ashi, almost exactly the same. As she goes to roll, I chase the knee, or chase the floor with my top knee. And now when she goes to pull herself out and away, it's just not going to happen. Now there's so much pressure, she has to roll through, and as she rolls through, we're in, we're ready to break with an outside ashi garami or an inside ashi garami, one way or the other. We get to a finish, and we make a transition from an inside ashi, we roll our partner through, we use the same single roll through we looked at before, and then we're either outside breaking or inside breaking.
