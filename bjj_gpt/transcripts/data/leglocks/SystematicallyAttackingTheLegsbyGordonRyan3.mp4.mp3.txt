 Alright, now we're going to start outside ashi garami. And outside ashi garami is very good for breaking your partner. But understand there are guard passes where your partner can come forward and pressure you and there are instances where your partner can start standing up or scooting the corner and taking your back. Now in general I like to use a rimi ashi garami or other ashi garamis to expose the heel. But there are great ways you can expose the heel from an outside ashi garami and go right into breaks from there. So just understand that there are key differences here but ultimately when you want to break your partner's leg to the outside heel hook, outside ashi garami is by far one of the best options. So let's look at some of the options now and how we can control ashi garami and expose our partner's heel to go into breaks from an outside ashi garami. Alright so we're working with a rimi ashi garami. We have a physical wedge between myself and my partner which means guard passing and back takes are going to be very difficult for my partner from here because of this inside leg position. When my foot shoots across into outside ashi, now my partner can come forward, she can attack my back, she can put her knee on the floor, she can pressure into me and start passing from there. So we start running into some issues. So I generally prefer to use an rimi ashi garami to expose the heel and then an outside ashi garami to break my partner. But like I said there are good positions where you can break your partner and expose the heel right from here. Understand that you're going to have to use an achilles grip a lot more from outside ashi garami to avoid being passed and avoid having your partner take your back because of the fact that you don't have an inside leg anymore. So from here if I ever feel my partner's knee slips outside my knee line and I feel like I'm going to get my back taken, have confidence the achilles grip will keep you safe. Like I said from here, the rimi ashi garami, if she goes to scoot towards my back, I physically have an inside leg. There's no way she can come forward and towards me and actually get my back from here. When I'm in this position, the second she goes to slide around the corner, now she's halfway to my back from here. This is no good. So you're going to be using an achilles grip a lot more from this outside ashi position. So anytime my partner goes to come forward towards me, it's going to be difficult because of the achilles grip. Anytime my partner goes to start taking my back, even if she gets close to my back and she goes to start taking my back from here, the achilles grip, have the confidence the achilles grip will always keep you safe from this position. So you're going to be, you have a lot more risk of getting your guard passed, of getting pressured, of getting your back taken, which means you're going to have to use the achilles grip a lot more to keep you safe. In the intermediary steps between controlling the ashi garami and actually exposing your partner's heel. Another thing the ashi garami, or the achilles lock does, it stops your partner from taking your heel to her butt. If you look at any ashi garami from cross ashi garami, from 50-50, from outside ashi, if your partner wants to come forward and crush you, she has to get a knee to the floor and then bring her heel close to her butt. When I have this achilles grip, it stops my partner from taking her heel to her butt. So she has to come forward. It's very hard for her to bring her heel into her butt from here. Anything that keeps my partner's heel away from her butt, whether it be with an achilles grip, whether it be with a scoop grip, anything that keeps my partner's heel away from the butt will make it very hard for my partner to come forward and pressure me. Now the scoop grip over exaggerates your partner's heel and butt connection. You can keep your partner's leg completely straight with the scoop grip. The problem is transferring from a scoop grip to a heel hook grip quickly is difficult. You have to pass the foot underneath and then it takes a while. With the achilles grip, I can switch right from an achilles right to a heel hook grip. So I generally prefer to use the achilles grip. If I feel someone's pressuring forward towards me so hard where they're just driving forward, then from here I'll switch. If I have an achilles, for example, I'll make a switch where I come through, I pummel my hand underneath, and then I go to a scoop grip like so. So when she goes to come forward, she can't do it. And now I wait until she goes back down or I kick the hand out and I put it back down to her butt, and now you can start sitting up and start going in and isolating your partner's heel, going in for heel hooks and then doing whatever you're going to do from there. But there's some key differences between a rimi ashi gromi and outside ashi gromi. And one of the key differences is you'll have to use an achilles grip more. So number one, keep your partner flat and keep their heel away from their butt to stop them from crushing you. And number two, if the ashi gromi is not set properly and she starts to create back exposure, use the achilles grip to stop the back exposure, to climb up the leg. Let's say she's here and she slips the knee, I can climb back up my partner's leg with the achilles grip. And now from here we can go back into our attacks. All right, so one of the most common things you'll find when you lock this outside ashi gromi is people will start trying to interfere with the second leg by throwing it up and over and high-legging and crossing their legs and then counterattacking you. Or just interfering with your ability to lock a heel hook regardless. What you'll see is this leg will come over like so, and then your partner will try to lock their legs and now their legs are safe and now if they separate your feet, now they can start going in for heel hooks on you. Okay, so you don't want your partner throwing this leg over and ending up interfering with your ability to lock heel hooks on them and also keeping their legs safe while they attack your legs. So just a very basic thing is the second I see an ashi gromi, my partner goes to high leg over, I just keep my elbow and my hip connected and I keep my hand in here somewhere. When she goes to fire her leg over, I just wipe my partner's leg off. I wipe my partner's leg off. Every time she goes to throw it over, this will be, you'll see like she throws it over four or five times and every time she goes to throw it over, she goes to pommel, I wipe it off. She goes to pommel, I wipe it off. And we're here. I just keep wiping that leg off. If she gets it through, we go here. What I don't want is for her to cross the ankles. Now it's going to take a while for me to separate the legs. Okay, if she does cross the ankles, I have to go through and grab my partner's heel and grab my partner's foot like so and physically separate. And now from here I lean back and I wipe it off and I lean forward. And the second I see the high leg come over, I immediately wipe. If I miss it from here, the whole thing is I don't want her crossing the ankles. So I come forward with my hips and I come forward with my chest and I pull my partner's calf muscle with the, whether it be with an Achilles or whether I just pinch my elbow and I pull my partner's calf muscle in like so. So that my hips come forward, my chest comes forward. When she goes to actually lock her ankles from here, it's hard to get a purchase on her own calf and her own ankle. That makes it easy for me to come in and just wipe everything off. I know she's going to throw it over. I go in and we wipe it off. If she does come over and she actually locks the ankles, this is no good. Now from here I come in, I grab the heel, I grab the sole of the foot. When she goes to keep them locked, you can always separate and now as I lean back, I just wipe it back across and then immediately I know she's going to come back. Elbow comes to hip and we come in and we're here. And now from here we can go and start to expose our partner's heel. So one of the most common things you'll see if your partner's going to stay in the pocket is they'll palm that leg over trying to interfere with your ability to heel hook them and then they'll go into counterattacks on you. So we always just wipe it off, wipe it off. If we feel like we missed with the hand, we have to stop them from crossing the ankles. You have to come forward and pull my partner's leg towards me like so. And now from here when she has to lock, she can't do it. She does lock, now we're in a late stage defense. We grab the heel, we grab the sole, we separate, we wipe everything off and now we're back into our attacks. So another great way that we can counter my partner's high leg coming over is by threatening a submission. This will usually dissuade your partner from throwing the leg back over a second or third time. So the second the leg comes over, I step into this position. Instead of wiping it off, as she has to throw it over, I usually when I go to wipe it off, my palm is face down and we just wipe the hand off. This time she gets to throw it over and I turn my palm up like so and we just go and we catch. And from here we go through and we lock in the wrist to wrist toe hold like so. And now the whole thing again is always toes to butt, heel to chin. So the finishing mechanics from here are as my left elbow comes down to crunch the toes in, my right elbow comes up towards the ceiling. I always want to catch if I can, this is all happening fast, but if I can I get a crease of my elbow right at the long end of the lever. So from here when I lock up it's just so so tight. Now my chin comes over my own hands. Now from here we crunch the toes in, we pull the right elbow back and up towards the ceiling and from here we get incredibly strong finishes with wrist to wrist toe hold. More than likely what's going to happen is your partner will come forward and get to your hands. She'll pull the hands off, as the hands separate we wipe the leg back over and now your partner is going to be worried about throwing that leg over a second or third time or fourth or fifth time, whatever the case is. Because now she knows that there's a legitimate threat of submission there and she's probably going to do something else. So instead of just playing a palm-langing where she goes to throw it over, I clear, she goes to throw it over, I clear, and we're here for eight, ten times we're doing this. She goes to throw it over this time, from here I turn my palm up and I sit forward. Maybe I wipe it off a few times, we're playing here, we're playing, I'm trying to wipe the leg off and then from here I sit up towards her. We go forward, as we go forward we shoot our elbow to the Achilles and then we lock up. From here we get incredibly strong ability to finish our partner with a wrist to wrist toe hold. She gets to my hand, she pulls usually the top thumb off and after she does so we just wipe everything through and now we can go back into exposing our partner's heel and getting into attacks from outside Ashi. We spoke about this a little bit before as far as using Achilles grips. Understand that in order to control my partner from an outside Ashi Garami, I want my hips as close to my partner's as possible and I want her knee as far within my knee line as possible. The further her hips are, the less purchase I have on her leg and the closer her knee gets to slipping outside of my knee line. Whenever I see her knee is slipping and her hips are moving away, I always switch back to that good old trusty Achilles grip and I can use this to start pulling myself and my partner back in towards me. Or I can climb back up my partner's leg and now from here we can switch to our heel hold grips and we can go in for finishes. Whenever I see my partner's pressuring forward towards me, whenever I see my partner's trying to take my back and scoot to corner, whenever I see my partner's standing over me, we always use either an elbow pinch like so or even better an Achilles grip. Using the elbow is always going to be faster, less robust. Achilles grip will take longer to get to but be more robust. If my partner stands up over me and I have outside Ashi, I don't want back exposure. I don't want her to hear my legs get pushed down and she lifts my hips so that she starts taking my back. So from here I always have an Achilles grip. So even from here, if my partner goes in and starts trying to expose my back, there's just no way because of the Achilles grip. She can sit all the way to her hip and get full upper back exposure from here. It means nothing. When she goes to take my back, that Achilles grip allows me to slide back in and start getting exposure on my partner's heel. So we want a hip to hip connection the best we can. We want her knee trapped as far within our knee line as possible and we always control my partner and deny back exposure through using either an elbow pinch like so or a full Achilles grip like so. When in doubt, if you have an issue and you're worried about getting your back taken, you're worried about getting a guard passed, use an Achilles grip. The Achilles grip is king. It allows you to climb the leg, it allows you to hold on to your partner even when they're slippery most of the time and it allows you to deny your partner the ability to bring her heel to her butt, take your back, do all kinds of things she wants to do in order to start attacking you. So whenever you feel you're attacking your partner's legs and you feel like the heel hook's just not there, things are starting to go downhill, we just switch right back to the Achilles. We switch back to the Achilles and start control position and now from here we can climb back up the leg, we can get to the positions we want and then when we're ready on our time, then we can switch back to heel hook or we can go in and start going back into the attacks. So we deny back exposure, we control the outside Ashi and one of the best ways to control your partner and keep yourself safe from outside Ashi Garami is by using that Achilles grip. So now another issue that we've run into is forward pressure. We looked at my partner trying to pommel legs by taking a high leg over. Another thing she can do is try to come forward and pressure me. My partner goes to come forward and pressure me. I want to keep her heel away from her butt and I want to keep her hips pinned. As she goes to come forward, I can keep her heel away from her butt and her hips pinned by sizzling my legs. So the second she goes to come forward towards me, I'm just going to shoot my top leg in towards her hips and pull my bottom knee in towards my own body. So from here it pulls her heel away from her butt and it puts weight over her hips. So from here I'm trying to expose my partner's heel. She goes to come forward and crush me and I just turn into this semi belly down position. From here when she goes to extract her leg, she can't pull her leg out. When she goes to scoot back and away from me, I have a strong back heel around my partner like so. If she tries to scoot around the corner like she just did, she exposes her own heel. So whenever my partner's moving back and away from me, this is easily dealt with by just a strong back heel behind your partner's hips and or an Achilles grip. Once she's trying to come forward towards me, scissoring of the legs is always a good option. From here I shoot the top leg towards my partner's hips, my hips come off the ground and from here I take my other knee in towards me. And now you can wedge your partner's calf muscle between your chest and between your leg. Because at any point your partner tries to rip the leg out, there's a lot of wedging around the leg. When she goes to scoot the corner towards my back, it's not going to be easy. She'll inherently expose her own heel. So we can scissor the legs and we can use this to keep my partner's heel away from the butt to keep her hips pinned and to stop forward pressure onto me. Whenever I see someone, the second I see this leg come in, she posts on the floor, she starts driving into me and I'm like, oh man this is no good. And I'm always here. When she goes to crush me from this position, it's not going to be easy. And now from here we can go in, start exposing our partner's heel and go into all of our winning attacks once we get the heel hook rip lock. Another way we can control a partner's hips and stop her from coming forward is by putting a physical wedge in front of my partner's hips with my shin as she goes to come in forward and crush me. And from here, instead of scissoring the legs like so, I can physically put my back on the floor and I can scoot underneath my partner's leg. So the way that I do this is I grab a false grip on my partner's knee and I just scoot my hips in like so. And now I take my shin across my partner's hips. Now if your legs are open, your partner can throw her leg over and start to go for inverted heel hooks on you. So this is no good. So from here we go in and we lock a triangle like so. When she goes to come forward towards me, she physically can't get up because of the fact that there's a wedge in front of her hips. You can combine these two or use a leg scissor to start with and then you put a shin across your partner's hips. Where I'm here, she goes to get up. She's giving me a hard time. She goes to come forward. She's getting too far forward. From here I have the initial leg scissor and I make some space. From here I can switch to a cross shoulder post and I can put my foot out on the floor somewhere out here. So as she goes to come forward, I can make space and I can scoot and push my knee across and physically post to my own knee. Because she's coming forward towards me, she needs a post hand. So there's no danger of a heel hook from here. So as she goes to come forward, I just scoot. I just start shrimping and now when her hand's off the floor, now there's a danger of a heel hook. Now I can go in and relock my legs, making it safe and then we can sit our partner back down. So we're combining these two methods. But from here, we start the leg scissoring motion. She goes to start getting up towards me. Okay. A lot of times she gets to a knee and she builds up into this position here. The scissor now won't be enough. Whenever I see this, I don't want to collapse in the outside of my knee. So the cross shoulder post makes space. When she goes to come in towards me, I just use this left leg to start shrimping out and away like so. She goes to come in towards me and we just shoot that leg across. Now we physically post on our own knee. When she goes to come up, she can't come up and start crushing me anymore. And now from here, we can either go back to where we came or we can start exposing our partner's heel in the opposite direction. Okay. So we can play these two together. She goes to start coming up. Now we can expose the heel. So we can use a combination of leg scissoring and that cross shin across my partner's hips to stop her coming forward and crushing me. Another thing that we can do is when my partner goes to come forward towards me, if I feel like I'm just losing the battle and the scissoring is not working and I can't make enough space to get my knee, my shin across my partner's hips, just go with it and go into a forward roll instead. Okay. So whenever I see, and same thing from a Rimi Ashi Grommy we looked at before, from here, I feel like my partner's just too good, base is too good, she's too big, whatever the case is. She goes to come forward towards me. I just go in. As she goes to come forward, I go cross shoulder. And now I just tuck my head and I roll on through. And now from here, we're in outside Ashi. She's either down on a knee. She's down on her butt, whatever the case is. And now we can take her weight off of us. We can switch that cross shin. Or now I land, you notice, with my shin across my partner. So when she goes to come forward towards me, I can always post and reinforce that wedge with my hand, make it hard for my partner to come forward and then either expose her in this direction, sit her back down. There's a variety of different things that we can do from here, which we'll look at later. Okay. The main thing is stopping her initially from coming forward and making me carry body weight by just going with it. The whole thing is I tuck my head between my partner's legs and I just use the extension of my body to guide my partner in the direction she wants to go and I get her weight off of me. So from here, she goes to come forward. Everything's failing. Instead of using a cross shoulder this time to make space, we use a cross lat grip like so. So now as she goes to come forward, I take my two feet and I just use my feet to walk underneath my partner into this inverted position. Now when she has to base out, she's loaded onto my hips. I just extend my legs like so. Now what I don't want is for her to drive her knee to the floor and flatten me out from here. This is no good. I post my foot because she's coming forward. There's no danger of a heel hook yet. And now from here, we shrimp. I lock my legs. She goes to come forward towards me now. I can always stop her. What I don't want is to land here so now she can beat the outside of my knee. I always want to keep my shin in front of her hips. So when she goes to come forward one more time, it'll look like this. She goes to drive forward. Now we're ready to go in and keep our attacks from outside of her. Whether your partner lands on her knee, which you probably will, or if she lands flat down on her butt again, you just go right back into the same series we've been looking at this whole time. But the main thing is, as she goes to start coming forward, we go cross lat and we just tuck our head between our partner's legs and we use our forward momentum to go into a full front roll and then we bring that shin across to stop her from crushing us. Down, down, down. I'm not sitting down. Why do you have so much energy now? Sit down, I have a question. Someone explain to me the purpose of a jacket. Which is supposed to keep you warm, but also a belly shirt. A jacket's supposed to be warm, so why is it only covered half of her belly? It makes no sense. Reverso. This is fashion. Look at this. It keeps warm. And shoulder bonds. Ridiculous. Time guys. Time guys. Did you like that, Reverso? Let me put it on. Put it on. If you ruin it, you're going to have to buy a new one. Which one do you want to eat? Look at this hot doorbell. Is it still warm? Tell me if it's not warm. I'm cozy. And then this one. And this one. This is going to be your color. I'm not helping you. Don't breathe, bro. Whatever, man. This is warm, right? Yeah. I'm going to buy one. Wait, let me do my hair. Very good. Now let's look at exposing your partner's heel. We have control elements from the ashi garami. Now let's look at how we can actually expose our partner's heel. We can do this in a belly down or belly up fashion. Now, in order for me to expose my partner's heel, I need to heel out here somewhere. If she has her heel connected to my hip, there's going to be no way I can expose my partner's heel. So this is the number one thing I'm looking for when I'm looking for heel exposure, is finding ways to create a disconnection between my partner's heel and my hip. One of the best ways we can do this, especially going belly down, is by scissoring the legs. No matter how strong she tries to back heel, if my legs are crossed and she has a connection like so, when I scissor my legs, I always create a separation. Back heel. I always create a separation between my partner's heel and my hip. It may be a small separation, but there's always a space where now my wrist can float between that space and go in and we can expose our partner's heel. So we're going to grab a false grip on our partner's knee like so. She goes to start back heeling. From here, we scissor our legs like so, and we move into this belly down position. Now I have to use my left hand to expose my partner's heel. The problem is when I move into this belly down position, I'm posting on my left elbow. So I transfer weight from my left elbow to my forehand like so. And now from here, I don't just try to catch my partner's heel in any random way. I take my hand and I move it in this arcing position like a rainbow behind my body. And as I do so, my palm floats across the mat, and I turn my thumb down, and I physically touch my own rib cage like so with my thumb. Only from here, now do I flick my wrist in front. And now once we have that heel exposed, we fall back down to a situation where we're on our hip. Now we can go in and we can lock our two legs. Now when we go to finish, we're going to lock our legs in one of two ways. One, as I spoke about before, is from here, we can take a semi-senkaku where we lock in behind our partner's hips. If my partner goes to pull out and away from me, this is a great way to control our partner's hips from her pulling out and away. Two is a full triangle where I put a foot in here, my partner's hip, and we physically lock behind my partner's hips like so. So when she goes to pull away now, I still have a strong back heel, not as strong because it's just one leg, but I still have a strong back heel. And my partner goes to come forward towards me, I control my partner's hip to some degree with my left leg. So both are good. I don't prefer one or the other. I lock both of them. In the heat of the moment, you're trying to go for a heel up. A lot of times you lock your legs in various different ways, but both a full triangle and a semi-senkaku are both good ways to lock. One note, if you are going to lock in a semi-senkaku, my inside leg that's in between my partner's two legs here will always go on bottom. For breaking mechanics, it doesn't matter which leg is on top or bottom. They're both equally strong at pulling, whether you lock them like this or like this. But for safety, I don't want my partner grabbing my knee, opening up my heel, and now if we're in a shootout, she has an inverted heel hook, which is mechanically stronger than my outside heel hook, and you can get counter-locked from here. So I either go in with a semi-senkaku where my inside leg crosses on bottom, like so, behind my partner's hips, or I go into a full triangle with a post on my partner's hip, a full triangle and a back heel behind my partner's hips, like so. So just so you know, when you're going to break, you move in this scissor position, you expose your partner's heel, and then immediately it's right back to here or here. This is both good. So we start off, we have our legs locked, like so. Our partner goes to come forward, we scissor the legs. I move from elbow support to head. I leave my weight one from inside my knee to outside. Palm comes along the mat. I turn my thumb down. And I catch. Now immediately we fall back in. We go back to our lock, and then we're ready to go through and break our partner. So we just rotate so they can see the hand position. I scissor. Fall back down. We lock up. Now we're ready to go in and break our partner. We lock both belly down with a very specific hand position. Hand comes behind. I touch my own rib cage, and only then do I expose the heel. Then as we fall, we lock up, and we're ready to break. All right, so another great way of separating my partner's heel from their hip and stopping them from coming forward is by using a post-dashi to stop my partner from coming forward. Now when I go into a post-dashi, understand you're not going to have long to move from an outside-dashi to a post-dashi. There's a couple reasons why. Number one, your partner can just simply grab your feet and push them off your hip, this one, and then come forward like so. Number two, as you go into a post-dashi, your partner can take a hand through and go for a wrist-to-wrist toe hold, and now you have to come forward and fight the hands, and you have to bring yourself back to outside-dashi. So when you go into post-dashi, it's usually not a position if your partner's talented that you can hang out in for 30 seconds at a time. Like you're in there for five seconds, and your partner's going to either take the feet off, or they're going to try to counter-lock you. So this is just a method of quickly exposing your partner's heel while keeping them down. If they're trying to come forward towards me, and the scissoring method I feel like is not working, I can't expose my partner's heel, I can't go belly down for whatever reason. Maybe she's too good, and it's hard to catch her heel, whatever the reason is, I just take my inside leg and I just physically post on my partner's hip like so. Now from here, I reinforce and I post a second foot on my own foot. And now I use the extension, back heel strong, I use that extension to scoot and shovel my hips underneath my partner's like so. And this will always create a separation now of my partner's heel and my hip. So I have my legs locked, she has her heel glued to my hip. Now there's no heel exposure. When she goes to come forward, I just take my foot to her hip like so. From this position, I take my second foot and I reinforce it here. If at any point from here, this post-ashi is made to stop your partner coming forward towards you. If she goes to back up and away, things can get slippery from here. If at any point you see your partner try to rip the leg out, just back up, I have to go back in and put a back heel behind my partner's leg and then you switch to an Achilles maybe, climbing the leg, so you have to go back and forth. The purpose of the post-ashi is to stop someone from coming onto you, not pulling it back and away from you. So this goes back to strategy. So she goes to come towards me, I switch to post-ashi. Now my whole thing from here, because I'm going to be belly up when I expose, is I want to shovel my hips underneath my partner's leg. So you see here my hips are pointing out in this direction, the same way her knees are. I want to pull her knee across and as she goes to come forward, I use that post-ashi to start taking my hips underneath her leg. Now from here, because I can't post to my forehead, my elbow does the work and I use my elbow on a swivel to just catch here. I catch my partner's heel. So very different this time when I'm exposing the heel. She goes to come forward, I have a belly up exposure now. I post, I switch to post-ashi. When she goes to come forward towards me, we use that extension of our legs in a shoveling motion. Now our hips underneath our partner like so. Right from here, the heel falls onto her wrist. When she goes to hide the heel, hard. Now my legs slip off. The second I have that heel exposed, we go back in, we lock up our legs, and now we're ready to go in and break our partner with strong outside heel hooking positions. So this time, going belly down is not working for whatever reason. I want to go belly up this time. So we're fighting here. I feel like she has her leg tucked in. I feel like I just can't do it. We go in and we switch to post-ashi. We reinforce our leg, and now as she goes to come forward towards me, she can't because of the post-ashi. When she goes to hide her heel, go ahead, we can always go in and we can lock up. And now from here, if my partner starts rolling, we can switch to that full figure four. We can break our partner belly up. As she goes to heel slip and come towards me, we keep the hands high, and then we go in and we break belly down. So we can always shovel our hips underneath using a post-ashi, and we just use our arm on a swivel to catch. And our leg can come back off, we lock up, and we're ready to break. All right, so now another way that we can expose our partner's heel belly up is by using two posted feet on the floor. So similar to a post-ashi, but it's not as strong because you're not posting on your partner's hips, but you can keep your feet in that position a lot longer. Okay, so the advantage of a post-ashi is you're physically stepping on your partner's hips. So it gives you a way stronger extension. It's easier to expose the heel, and you can stop your partner from coming towards you. The drawbacks are you usually can't keep your feet in this position for a long time. When I post a foot outside my partner's hip, I physically step on my own foot like so, your partner can't do anything to move your foot position. So it's not as robust, but you can stay here as long as you want. Okay, so now once she goes to drive forward towards me, again, my whole thing is false grip, and my knees come up to my hips. My whole thing is false grip, and my knees come up towards the ceiling. I want my knees pointing straight up and down towards the ceiling. So that's from here. I bridge forward first. That brings my partner's heel off the ground. And then as I bring my hips forward, she goes to come towards me. I shovel my hips underneath my partner's body, and I pull the knee across to my right hip. So my hips come forward, thrusting first. And as I come forward, I move underneath my partner's leg. So when she goes to come forward and towards me, hide the heel, do all those things everyone likes to do, we move into this position. And now right from here, we catch. Now depending on where she goes, if she comes towards me, we fall to the left hip. If she goes to roll, we switch to a figure four and make it hard for her to roll. Now she starts to roll through, she gets broken belly up, and we get strong finishes with belly up mechanics. So not as robust. You're going to have a harder time digging the heel, but your partner can't do anything to move your foot position really. So she's fighting, I'm trying to go belly down, I can't do it, I can't get to the post-doshi, so we just go in here and we plant the feet. She goes to stop me from exposing. We lock up and we break. Another method of exposing your partner's heel, belly up, is to use a cross shin. Same cross shin we used before, where from here, everything we've been doing so far has been based around my partner's body more or less being outside my knee. Here, here, where her torso is outside of my knee. This time, we're going to move into a situation where we bring our shin across our partner's hips and we move into a situation like so. This usually starts from when my partner starts tucking her legs in and starts trying to come towards me in this situation here, and tries to start rocking to one side or the other and start coming up. Exactly. She wants to clear that knee most of the time, so she can start to come forward, get her knee to the floor, collapse her torso on the outside of my knee, and start pressuring me. Right from here, whenever I see my partner tucking this knee in, a good option from here is she will always be coming forward and trying to beat my knee with her shoulder. If she can get her shoulder in front of my knee, this is no good. Right from here, we just take a shoulder post, a V-grip here on my partner's shoulder. As she goes to beat me from here, she's coming forward, so I have the ability now to unlock my legs. If she's leaning back and I unlock my legs, she can come forward and go into heel hooks from here. If she's pressuring forward into me, there's no danger of a heel hook now, so I can unlock my legs freely. From here, as she goes to beat that knee with her shoulder, I just post. I use my two feet, unlocked, to just shrimp. As she goes to come forward, I just shrimp, and I invert my knee like so. Now from here, we go and we lock up. As she goes to come forward now, I have a physical wedge between myself and my partner. It's the easiest thing in the world now to pull my knee in towards my chest. If she straightens her leg from here, you won't be able to expose the heel, so I have to create a bend in the leg. I do this by pulling my partner's knee to my right hip. As I pull my left knee in, that creates a bend in my partner's leg here. Now from here, we use that same cowboy drill we looked at before. We just go through and we catch. Now, your partner has two possible reactions. She can start to roll, which will probably be most common from here, or she can try to heel slip and turn back this way, in which case she puts us on the left hip, and we go in and we're ready to break. This time, my partner tries to come forward towards me, and she tries to get her shoulder in front of my hip or in front of my knee like so. From here, we just quickly post with the V-grip on our partner's shoulder. She goes to come forward, we shrimp, and we invert the knee like so. Now from here, I have to put a bend in the leg. So we go back to the knee, and then we pull the knee across to our right hip as we pull our left knee into the back of our partner's knee. From here, once she goes to keep bending that leg, we can use our elbow even on the toes. We crunch the toes down, pull the knee across. Now we go right back to that cowboy drill we looked at before. We just quickly go in and catch, and we got it. And now from here, wherever she goes to move, we're ready to break. She goes to roll through, we break. She goes back belly down, we lock up, and we break. This is when my partner is insistent upon trying to collapse my knees together by flanking me. We just post in the shoulder, bring the shin across, and then we can expose belly up and go into our winds from there. So good belly down and belly up exposure. And we start going into Tapo Shiro later. We'll talk more about exposing my partner's heel from there as well. But there are many different belly down and belly up ways of exposing our partner's heel, and they're all very good. It just depends on what your partner's doing and what exactly you're looking for. All right, so now once we actually lock a heel up on our partner, okay, we have a couple of different stress tests we can do, whether we lock belly up or belly down. The first one is if we lock and we're in a more belly down position, the first stress test we have is we have our hand locked, either with one hand or with two hands. If your hands are unlocked, it would obviously be more challenging, so this is the best way to do it. We just lock up. Once we catch, we have our partner try to first straighten their leg. If you have a sufficient back heel and good hand position, your partner won't be able to straighten the leg. If you have no back heel, she can move backwards and straighten the leg, and now you're going to lose the heel hook. The first thing is, can she straighten the leg? When she tries to, she can't. Now, when she goes to drag herself backwards and away, the back heel will not allow that. When she goes to come forward, she shouldn't be able to heel slip. If my hands are too low and she goes to come forward, she'll always heel slip. Can she straighten the leg? No. Can she back away from me? No. Can she come forwards into me without breaking her own leg? No. If you can not allow your partner to move backwards, if you can not allow your partner to move forwards, and if your partner can't straighten the leg to a degree she wants, that's what we're looking for as far as the ashi garami and the upper body are concerned. Now, when we're belly up, when we expose, we actually get a grip here on our partner like so. Then, can my partner move out and away from me? If my hips are off the floor, she can't move away, and she won't be able to straighten the leg. If from here we lock up and she goes to straighten the leg, it'll be a lot less bend because ultimately we're trying to open up the leg to break. But what I can't have is a situation where she fully straightens the leg, and now from here there's not a complete heel knee bar, but there's not really a heel hook, and your partner starts to thumb post, and then she starts to move away. So she shouldn't be able to fully straighten the leg. When we lock up here, when she goes to straighten, there should be still bend in the leg. When she goes to pull out and away from me, my hips should be high. So when she goes to put two hands on the floor and goes to drag herself away, she's carrying body weight because my hips are off the ground. And finally, can she come forward towards me and try to fight my hands? If your knees are not splayed open with weight over your partner's hips, if my knees are pinched together, she can get her shoulder in front, and now she can come forward and she can pull one hand down, then the hands are low, and the heel slips. So the whole thing from here is to keep a good bend in the leg, my upper body position, and I'll have that much of a back heel behind my partner's hips. I can keep a good bend once the grip is locked. I can keep my knees splayed open so my hips are off the ground. So when she goes to run away from me, she can't. When she goes to flank my knee and come forward, she can't. And in the time allowed, we can easily break our partner with catastrophic breaks from a belly-up position as well. So just stress testing both belly-down and belly-up positions after we expose the heel so our partner can't just aggressively explode out and get away from us. All right, so there's always going to be times where your partner will heel slip. They'll come forward towards you, just like a heel hook. You're like, okay, I'm going to finish. They come forward and the heel slip. Whenever you see this, the big mistake people make is they try to recapture the heel when they're already being stacked. This is a mistake. If you feel the heel slip and your partner comes towards you, don't worry about it. Use that forward momentum to just roll your partner through and then re-expose the heel on the opposite side, okay, or on the back side. So whenever I see I get a heel hook on my partner, I'm going to finish. She goes to drive forward. The heel slips. Everyone tries from here. They're already flat down. They're trying to dig for the heel, not a carrying body weight. This is not what I'm looking for here, okay? Your partner will be driving forward because she doesn't want her leg to break, so she's trying as hard as she can to heel slip. Okay, go back down. The second I feel my partner comes forward, the heel slips. The second I see this, I switch to an Achilles grip. Now she goes to come forward, we just use that same cross lap, and we just invert underneath in between our partner's legs. Now we just fire our partner out and away down to the floor. Now she'll be trying to usually flank my knee and come forward, so we immediately scoot. We invert that shin, and now we're in that same position to go in and expose our partner's heel, belly up, and then go in and break our partner from the same position we just looked at previously, okay? So whenever I see my partner is pressuring forward, I'm thinking I have this heel hook. I'm going to finish, and then, oops, the heel slips at the last second. Don't try to recapture the heel. Just use that forward momentum to roll through and then expose it on the flip side, okay? So I have the grip. She goes to come forward. I switch to an Achilles. I take my partner forward. She tries to come in and crush me again. We bring that shin in front, and now from here, we can always expose the heel by catching the toes and then putting a bend in the knee by pulling the knee across and pulling our quadriceps up and behind our partner's knee. So even the strongest people, when they go to keep that leg bent, it's the easiest thing in the world to put a bend in that leg and then go in, lock up, and be ready to finish. All right, so now this is very similar to a Rimi Ashi Garami, just a little bit different leg position, so we're just going to run through it real quick. My partner's in an Atarashi Garami, and she builds to a knee. Of course, we looked at an Erimi Ashi Garami. We open up the knee. We make space for the reap, and then we fire our left leg across. A little bit different from an Atarashi Garami because of the fact that the leg position is different. So from here, when I want to expose my partner's heel from this position, what I'm looking to do is most of the time she's trying to flank me like so. She comes all the way up to a knee, and from here, it's hard to expose my partner's heel because of the fact that there's weight over the foot now. So again, I use that same off-balance, that same Kazushi, where my hips are nice and high like so, and then we look to knock our partner down and open up the knee. She will always resist by trying to point the knee towards me so she doesn't fall back down and have to fall either to her hand or to her butt, and then the foot becomes weightless, and the heel gets exposed. So as I try to point the knee out, she points the knee in, and from here, I post on my partner's shoulder. The post on my partner's shoulder will monitor distance so that I can always now immediately invert my right knee and pull my knees into position. Now, once my right knee is inverted, I immediately switch back to a false grip. So when she goes to straighten her leg now, it's not easy. She can't put weight back on the foot. Her whole thing is to keep her foot flat. My whole thing is to keep her foot off the floor. So when she goes to flatten her foot now, it's her one leg versus my two legs and my hand. And now from here, we go in, we catch, we lock up, and we're ready to break. So similar to a Rimi Ashi Garami, but there's no need for a reap this time. We're just bringing the shin across. So when I have an outside Ashi Garami, she comes up to a knee. The whole thing is back to Zushi now. She's trying to come forward and get to my head most of the time. Whenever I see this, it's always about first, if she has control of the head, we've got her over this and guard retention. The first thing is I pump the knees and I create space like so. Now I look to put her butt on the floor, so she has to point the knee back inside. The second I see this, we immediately invert the knee and we catch. When she goes to straighten the leg and face me again, put the foot back on the floor. It's not going to be easy. We catch it, they lock up, and now we're ready to break. Okay, so there's no need for a reap this time. We just use the cross shin method to expose our partner's heel, take the foot off the floor, and then go into our breaks. Now we can just talk about the, I know it kind of seems redundant to me because I'm filming this all in a couple of days, but for you guys, you may have watched this a month ago or a week ago, whatever the case is. Just understand that whenever you're having a hard time exposing your partner's heel because of whatever reason, maybe your dig isn't that good or your partner's doing a great job of pointing the toes and hiding the heel. Whenever there's not heel exposure, I'm trying to expose my partner's heel and I just can't do it. Maybe I get here, I just can't get a grip on the heel. From here, we can always go back and we can move back to that concave position, and we can go right back into all of our tight Achilles locks from here. Okay, so just understand that we've been working on digging for heel locks. Whenever we can't dig for a heel lock, we can just go in and we can go to Achilles locks. We can use the Lumbar Game between Achilles locks and heel locks to get to a break and get to an eventual finish. Okay, so just reiterating the dilemma between the Achilles lock. If your partner has a booted foot, it's easy to expose the heel. If your partner points the toes, it's easy to expose an Achilles lock. And you play these two off one another to get either a heel hook or an Achilles lock. All right, so we're going to run through just some of the similarities and differences between an Achilles lock and whether or not you have an imiri Ashi Garami or an outside Ashi Garami. Okay, when I have an imiri Ashi Garami, understand that we can always go to post Ashi, like we talked about before. Understand that we can go to a butterfly Ashi if my partner steps over my foot. And we can go and now we can start entering into the far leg. We can bring our knee across. We can back step. We can do all kinds of things. When you have an outside Ashi Garami, your partner is going to be trying to separate your legs from here. So it's going to be harder for me to start pommeling my legs under into a butterfly Ashi because my partner's hips won't be coming up most of the time. And if your partner does, from here, start to raise the hips, understand that you can pommel the foot back to the inside. You can start going into butterfly Ashi, and then you can start going into bringing your legs back inside, and now you're back in an imiri Ashi Garami. So you can transfer back and forth between the two. Most of the time when you're in outside Ashi, you're going to stay in an outside Ashi Garami. And when you go to finish, all the finishing mechanics will remain the same from here. We're going to have the elbow in good position. We're going to have whatever hand position we want. And now we're going to start moving our hips out and away first, and then bridging and finishing for the wind. The best of all, as always if you're in outside Ashi, is transferring to a post Ashi. So the second my partner puts her hands on the floor and goes to come forward, I switch to a post Ashi. I'm right here. Now my hips move away, and now from here we can start extending after our hips move out and away from our partner's hips. So the mechanics are all going to be the same. When I'm in outside Ashi with my partner, it's just that you won't have as many different configurations with your leg position as you would if you're starting in an imiri Ashi Garami. It's a lot easier to back step into your partner's legs, to switch legs. Whereas if you're in outside Ashi, you can do that. You can go back to an imiri Ashi Garami. But in general, you're going to be mostly committed to staying with your legs on the outside or moving into a post Ashi and going from here. But they're relatively similar. You just won't have as many options from an outside Ashi. So now we're going to look at just going into finishing an Achilles lock from an outside Ashi Garami. This is like a whole different move, so I put it into a different segment. My partner goes to defensively roll out of an Achilles lock. And you see this is actually a great solution to dealing with Achilles locks, because if my partner feels the grip is so tight that you can't come forward and boot the foot, what many people will start doing is they'll start rolling in this direction and turning and thumb posting on my hamstring. And she'll start to turn the foot into a position where now from here, there's just not enough heat and the angle is wrong on the Achilles lock. So what it'll look like is as she goes to lock a strong Achilles on me, she goes into an outside Ashi. What she needs is she needs her wrist connected to the back of my Achilles. So what you'll see a lot of people doing is they'll turn and they'll create an angle now where my heel and my Achilles point more towards my partner's elbow rather than pointing towards my partner's wrist. So when she gets to finish the Achilles, the angles are slightly off and you're just not going to get breaking pressure from here. Whenever I see this from an outside Ashi Garami, my partner goes to start rolling. The second I see this, I follow my partner like so. So we have hands, legs and I, I follow my partner right from here. My partner can stop me from coming towards her with this leg. What she can't stop me from doing is raising and opening the leg. When she gets to push down, I can't push back in this direction. And what she tries to stop me from going up and over, I can always move the hand out and away. And from here, we just fire our left leg through. We start reaping across out in this direction. Now you have a choice of going in and either exposing our partner's heel or we can go in and we can just go into a belly down position. So, like so. And now from here, if I want to finish the Achilles, from here, we just go into that same belly down position. Or from here, we build up to an elbow like so. And now we start bridging. From here, as we go to start bridging, we just move into a full belly down position. Where we spread our knees, we post in the hand and now the head comes up, the hips drive in and we get strong finishes with a belly down Achilles. Okay? So you can do this from outside Ashi or from here. We lock up a strong Achilles grip. From this position, she goes to start thumb posting and turning. I open the leg up, out and away and I start reaping through. Okay? From this position, we go in and many times from here, depending on how tight the grip is, I can just bridge in and I can finish right in this position. But ultimately, the strongest one is always going to be a belly down position. Where we come in, we heist up, scissor the legs, knees wide and then from here, it's posting in the hand and then a bridge with the head coming forward, head coming up and the hips coming in. Okay? You can actually also do this, I forgot to mention before, from an Arimiyoshi garami as well. Where from here, I go to finish, my partner goes to roll defensively and we just reap out and across. And from here, we build to an elbow. We can hip in, we can bring the knee down and then we can just bridge and we can finish right from this position. Many times from here, this won't be enough. So as your partner starts to look to straighten the leg, defend, whatever the case is, I just come up to my two knees. And now from here, it's hips in, head up and we get strong finishes with the belly down Achilles. Okay? So we can, if my partner goes into a defensive roll, whether from outside Ashi or from Arimiyoshi, just forgot to do the Arimiyoshi before, you can always follow belly down. And then you can either finish on your side and on your elbow, or if that's not powerful enough, just go fully belly down, hips come in, head comes up, and then you get a strong belly down Achilles grip. So pretty much the same from Arimiyoshi to outside Ashi, just some slight differences and variations of the leg position, but it's overall the same and the mechanics are all the same. So now working in outside Ashi, heel knee bars are very common. Okay? If you look at most of Paul Harris's finishes in the UFC, they're actually heel knee bars. They're not actually heel hooks. A few of them are heel hooks, but a lot of them are heel knee bars. Now a heel knee bar is interesting because you use a heel hook grip, but mechanically you finish a knee bar. And it's very interesting because the heel, as we've mentioned before, the heel hook grip makes it impossible for your partner to turn in the direction she normally would if you just had a knee bar. So if I have an outside Ashi, for example, and she has to start rolling and she puts herself in a knee bar position. Like this, okay? And now I go in to turn and I look to start extending and finishing in a knee bar. If she just turns her toes and moves in the same direction she just came from, she just changes the angle and now there's no pressure on the knee bar anymore. Okay? So a heel knee bar comes from any situation where you can't quite keep a bend in your partner's leg. So it actually comes from a flaw in your Ashi Garami and the controlling mechanics. Okay? So you go for a heel hook, you want to keep a bend in the leg to go for an outside heel hook. But your partner actually extends before you can get the proper wedging in place and she extends her leg and she straightens it and she does a turn out. Whenever I see this, we just go and we lock a full figure of four over our partner's legs like so. Okay? From this position, we splay the knees, we raise the hips and now she's carrying body weight. And we keep that same heel hook grip. The heel hook grip has nothing to do with the break. The only purpose of the heel hook grip is so that if my partner goes to turn in the direction she wants to, to avoid the knee bar, she'll break her own leg in the heel hook. So the heel hook grip just allows me to solidify the position to stabilize everything long enough to break in the knee bar. Once the heel hook grip's in place, we simply splay our knees out. We take our hips up. And now as we take the ankle down to our chest, the hips drive in and we just finish with a basic belly up knee bar by splaying the knees, throwing everything in and finishing with a heel knee bar. Okay? So we lock a figure of four right where the buttocks meet the hamstring. And that allows me to carry my partner's weight. Even from here, if she goes to a high leg over, I can just bring my knee to the floor. We can finish a heel knee bar right from this position here. Okay? We can even switch our legs into a situation like so. And then from here we can finish a heel knee bar and we can get strong finishes. And for whatever reason, the angle changes and we just end up in either a cross ashi or a crisscross ashi or whatever we want, however we want to finish with a leg position on the opposite side. Okay? So the best case scenario is we're in outside ashi. Start again. We lock up an outside heel hook. We get a strong finish. Then from here, we say, oh man, the ashi grab is not as strong as we want it to be. She extends and starts to roll. As she does so, we just lock in and we lock into a heel knee bar here. Now from here, we splay the knees, hips come forward, we keep the heel hook grip. If she goes to came back where she came from, she breaks her own leg in the heel hook. That's no good. So from here, she ends up with a knee bar. Now as she goes to keep spinning, I have the choice of following and extending with the knee bar. You can switch into a crisscross ashi like so. Go back. Or as always, as my partner goes to roll through, we just switch our legs. We switch to a cross ashi, and now we're ready to go in and attack from cross ashi. Okay? So best case scenario, we finish the outside heel hook. Worst case scenario, we lose everything and we end up in cross ashi with the option to attack our partner for a second time. Okay? But a heel knee bar is an excellent way when you almost failed with the heel hook. You feel like your partner's about to slip out. You just go in and we lock up. And now from here, as she goes to pull away from me, which is not going to happen. And the whole thing is, knees open, then splay the knees, hips drive forward, and I just hug my partner's ankle to my chest. And as the hips drive forward, you get incredibly strong heel knee bars for the win.
