      " Antonio Fuentes is a product manager at Google responsible for making sure developers have an enjoyable experience when building applications with Google APIs. He recently posted a YouTube video answering questions about best practices for using the Google APIs and getting started quickly. One of the questions addressed was what to do if credentials become leaked. Google APIs Console has a feature that allows for rotating credentials, in which it's easy to create additional keys and turn the leaked key off without creating a new project. Another question was how long OAuth tokens last and when they expire. In general, an access token lasts an hour and a refresh token can be used at any time to request a new access token. If the Google Client Libraries are used, all the logic for this will be taken care of. Finally, one of the questions was how to know which APIs are support by the Discovery Service and the best way to find out is through the APIs Explorer.\n",
      "API keys allow developers to make API calls without fetching end-user data, such as a call to the Translate API. Client IDs are needed for API calls that involve fetching end-user data, such sending a call to the Google+ API to fetch posts. It is possible to send both an API key and client ID in the same call, though it is not necessary in most situations. Doing this allows developers to block IP addresses and HTT referers. Anonymous calls to Google APIs are generally not possible because credentials must be passed to identify the application and the end-user making the API call. To learn details about OAuth 20, there is a lot of information available on the web.\n",
      "Google provides extensive OAuth 20 documentation, which was discussed in a previous webinar, as well as a YouTube video. Additionally, there is an official Google developer site page that provides details about the protocol and scenarios such as using OAuth 20 for login or mobile devices. Google Client Libraries are available for nine different programming languages, and they handle OAuth steps and formatting of resources automatically, making Google APIs easier to use.\n"
