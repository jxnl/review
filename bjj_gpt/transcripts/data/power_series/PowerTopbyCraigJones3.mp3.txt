 Let's talk about that concept of the hip pocket and how we can use our legs to replace what we've recently done with the hip drags and hip pocket with our upper body, right? So I want to talk about basically how we can safely place our feet in what looks like dangerous positions, right? So if I get around the legs and I step in to this pocket here, but I'm facing Tyler's upper body, even if I'm facing his hip line, this leg is very dangerous here. 50-50 entries. And again, yeah, even potentially he could throw those reaps in and attack our legs, right? A lot of people think it's very dangerous to be placing legs around here and they kind of want to bypass this all together and remain at the shoulder line. But so long as I keep Tyler's hips on the floor, it's very difficult for him to attack the legs. So if one way to do that would be to hold his legs, but if he clears any of those grips, he can still throw that leg in and we're in danger here, right? So we were talking about earlier in the instructional how if we apply pressure down the line of these hips, we can keep his hips stuck on the ground there, right? So the best way to think about this is if Tyler has me in an arching position, single X position, and I escape this position and I step out to backstep out, I'm actually in a very, very safe position here, right? So you can see I've stepped out of the potentially dangerous leg locking position and I've landed in a position that's halfway through to passing here, right? So we were in this position, I immediately step out and control the feet from here and I feel kind of safe, right? So if we feel safe in that position, we don't need to step into it, actually, to end up in that position, right? I could step there straight through. So obviously if I step into that hip pocket, I'm in the same position as if I cleared the archie, but I wasn't in archie at all, right? So we can step into these dangerous sort of positions, but we just need to do it the right way and that is by applying forward pressure down the line. So if I'm going to place my leg in such a precarious position, right, I want my knee forward. So I'm not just going to control the legs, I'm going to keep my knee forward. Tyler tries to move here, tries to attack the legs. We're actually very safe here. If I leaned away from him, so if I'm scared of the legs here and I lean away, I'm back in the danger zone because he can lift his hips. So when we enter this position, we want to be all the way in. Tyler tries to lift his legs, lift his hips out, or again, we want to be all the way out. So if we're having trouble creating a toriando style pressure, if Tyler's guard retention is so good, every time I'm trying to get around the guard, he's able to keep his feet in square up. One possible way you might do that is frame against my leg. So as I come, he pushes here. So I'm trying to get possible toriandos and I'm having trouble creating those angles here. He keeps framing and staying square. So what we could do is we could step straight to this position. So I do have to come closer in terms of range. So I'm going to be stepping inside, but we've got to be quick here before he can secure this grip. So I would step, he goes for the grip, and we step out. Tyler goes to invert. I'm controlling the legs well and if I apply forward pressure, even harder to lift those hips and invert. We're going to start to back out here. From here we can potentially go to a reverse knee wrap. So there are ways we can apply pressure to the guard by kind of stepping through or stepping around. So again, think of it like we're in the position where we've backstepped out of an ashi. So if I'm in ashi, I clear it and we're facing down to the face. There's a reason that the backstepping gi and nogi is different. If Tyler's here, if I did it like I did in the gi, I would maintain an angle like this. But obviously, nogi, Tyler can re-invert and he can start attacking leg entries here. So when we step out, we need to do it in such a way that he cannot re-engage the legs. And that is by facing down the leg line here. So I want you guys to test this out, right? To further understand where we want to end up, start in ashi. And I want you guys to clear the foot, push both legs to the ground, and as you step out, we're high stepping, we're going foot to butt, we're facing down the legs. And I want you to test whether your training partner can start to lift these hips off the ground. If you can lift these hips, it's generally sticking to this as cautious and you're leaning away from him. If you control the feet and lean in, Tyler's trying to revert, trying to attack legs here, he's carrying the weight, he's trying to extend his legs, but I'm just leaning on him, right? And again, if we do start to feel in danger, retract your legs, get to the shoulder line, and we start working that positional pressure again. So when we start stepping in, we start to create a little bit of an angle, and I'm immediately going to step into the hip pocket. As I retract my other leg, Tyler's reaching for it, and we lean forward. Tyler's trying to attack, he's trying to move here, and we're able to clear that perceived danger zone. So we can sort of remain in this hip pocket, this perceived danger. A lot of people wouldn't do it. They'd do toriando passes like the gi, and even in knee ride, they'd get inverted on and then get entered into 50-50, hip cross arches. We can play around in this danger zone, we just need to see down the leg, down the leg line. We need to face their legs. So when we're stepping through, as long as we face the legs, don't play around with these positions here. If I face at all into his middle body here, if I'm looking this way or this way, this leg's in danger. If I'm looking down the leg line, he cannot elevate his hips, he cannot invert. And if he cannot do either of those two things, he can't attack my legs. So again, I want you to play around. We don't just need to hit toriandos, we can step into that pocket. So you can practice your footwork here. As long as we create these angles here, Tyler's going to be carrying my weight, he's going to be panicking. And then we can step to the shoulder line if we want. Again, we don't need to stay here. Typically speaking, Tyler tries to invert, he panics, then I can step to the shoulder line. But it's another way to apply pressure to this open guard position from the supine angles. But again, we've got to be quick, but we know, we can anticipate certain things. I know my frontier Tyler's going to reach for. We can make assumptions. If he doesn't reach for, obviously he's inviting cross knee passes. Because reverse teleheaver was invented to prevent the cross knee pass. So we know what he's going to reach, so we're controlling him. And we're stepping our feet straight out. But again, the best way to think about it is as if we were in single legs, ashi garami, and we high step out of that position. Everyone's super comfortable if they high step out of it. So why would you not be comfortable to put yourself in that situation in a way that you didn't end up there as a result of single leg acts? We're going to talk about something called the front pummel. This is something I stole from the man that changes weight divisions more than he changes underwear, Nicky Ryan. He sort of developed this as another way to enter the hip pocket. And again, he's better at me than this. I don't know if it's the shape of his body that could help, but he will be releasing a passing product. So definitely, you want to learn more about it, get into it. We're going to briefly touch on it today. It's going to go with our previous move, the high step. Just broadly speaking, ways to beat the legs and enter the hip pocket without having to necessarily go around the legs and also mitigating the risk of inversions. But ultimately, both these techniques are to fatigue our training partners. So these are two things we can add to Tori Andos. Sometimes we don't get a Tori Andos, we cut the line basically. So again, just to refresh, best case scenario, I can run around here. Well, that's a great deal of distance. We can take shortcuts. Just like we were covering earlier, I want to get around the legs. So I momentarily step inside. It's a shortcut to get to the shoulder line. But we can also, I'll explain this in more detail, we can combine all of these together. All of these are going to be like punches. We can combine those punches in unique ways to suit the problem at hand and it will help us further fatigue. You know what I mean? Someone will be like, hey Craig, I keep doing this and they get their guard back. And I'm like, that's the fucking point. Every time we make them react, they get tired. These are just ways we can beat the legs. If I'm in front of Tyler's legs, he's kind of relaxed. He's okay. If I get here, he's starting to panic more and more. If I start to get here, he's really starting to panic. So again, another way we can shortcut it is instead of using the outside leg, right? We were doing this one. We were stepping in to the hip pocket. We can also use our other leg too, right? So if I create a slight angle this way, Tyler drops onto his left hip. I can use and lead with my heel to step into the pocket here. Obviously, we still need to maintain the principle of collapsing the hips. If I see those hips start to come up, cut them off. Obviously, being careful of Tyler's nuts here. But again, if we're leaning back but not removing this leg, we're in danger, right? So if I just lean back here, Tyler's going to attack the legs. Even if I hold on, obviously he's going to overpower it at some point, it's slippery, start to engage the legs. So when we step into this hip pocket, if we're worried about inversion, at least block it for a second. I feel it come up, block, step back to the shoulder line, we can go back into our other passes. So throw this in with the outside leg, right? So we can step over the knee. We could front pummel too. So we lead with the heel. So when I'm stepping in here, I'm leading with the heel and it allows me to step into the hip. So we're here and watch my right foot. I lead with the heel and tense, activate my ankle. Those hips come up, we block him, we can step back here. But again, this is a very difficult position and you can see we can actually apply more weight to Tyler's legs here, directly above him. He is great, we can apply a lot of weight too. But if we're above it, Tyler's fighting here, I'm putting my entire body weight above the knees. Here, Tyler extends, he's got a bit more power here, right? He's still fatiguing, but he has a bit more power, right? So one more time. Front pummel, we can front pummel square. I'm going to block those legs and we bring that foot into the hip pocket. Always controlling the legs to the best of our abilities, right? If I have to rely on just holding Tyler's legs, good chance he slips and overpowers me with some sort of leg linkage. So that's why we're sort of hedging our bets here. And that is, if I'm in the hip pocket and I lose the legs and Tyler goes to inversion, my knee is preventing the inversion. So if we slip out here, there's no inversion. So we're sort of combining those two to keep the hips on the ground here, right? So one more time, we can start to create an angle and get him on the side here. You can see how it might be difficult for me to step this leg in sometimes and do a grip exchange when he's on the side here. But what he's not going to expect, we've got him on the side, we block that top leg, bottom leg too if we can. Tyler's trying to invert. I'm trying to send the burrito we ate for lunch back up. But again, we've got those two combinations and after this I'm going to show you how we can combine those two movements in tutorial does. So we have something else to throw into the combinations to again, create more fatigue, more stress in our training partner. Everything we've done so far builds upon the principles that we're ultimately seeking to get around the legs towards the shoulder line. The closer we get to that shoulder line, the less danger we have and the more weight we can make our training partner, our opponents carry. But again, we need to emphasize what we do from there and how we can really make them carry that weight in a safe way. Because obviously we don't just want to collapse inwards because people have some unorthodox movements from there where they can see invert into a triangle. Guys like John Blank have excellent arm bars from that position. So I'm not going to say you're completely safe and you can be reckless from there, but there are ways we can apply that pressure over time. But again, I need to emphasize this every time, right? Because every passing instructional is, it's like steps one, two, three, four, we do this, they do this, we do this, they do this, we pass. You know what I mean? Everything we're doing isn't ultimately leading to a pass. So we're not going to measure the success of a toriando pass by landing in a passing position. We're measuring our success in that of a fatigue level. It's better for me, especially in a longer match, to apply that toriando pressure, even if they explode and escape, even if we don't consolidate, than it is for me to pass and them having efficient escapes from that position and retaining their guard. Because again, it's all about inducing panic and stress and forcing explosions. And I believe we can do it again from passing as we can from everywhere else. So let's say we've gotten around the garden again. The further I head in this direction, the safer I am and the more weight we can apply to our training partner. So firstly, if Tyler's tired, chances are if I've been pushing on these legs consistently, there's a good chance we get here and if these knees come away, we could just come in and take that passing position, right? But let's assume that he has some conditioning level, some strength from here. What we're going to be looking to do is I'm going to be trying to keep my legs straight because it gives me depth over the top. If I bend my knees, look what happens to my head. It's heading away from Tyler. But we could bend our knees a bit close, but now my legs are at a range that Tyler can easily grab it. And that's not the end of the world, but ultimately it'd be great if he didn't have the ability to touch our legs so easily. Here he can grab our legs without leaving too much space, right? If I'm back here and he reaches, look at the space we've captured. So if you ever see people passing from north-south and their legs are straight and they're bent forward, it's because they're keeping their legs at a safe distance while also being in a position to keep their head forward and apply pressure. So even if it's uncomfortable, try to get the flexibility and the muscular endurance to adopt that posture. So when we create that angle here and I've captured the legs, I don't just want to lean forward here because if I lean forward here and Tyler extends his legs, I could start to fall forward. So we want to get our elbows inside here. So I start to work, once we get around this position, elbows inside. And we're going to achieve the same thing with elbows inside, and that is this movement here. If I'm pushing Tyler's legs this way and he's pulling his knees back in, this is a battle that I could hold forever. This is a battle that Tyler is basically, he has a short timeframe on this position. The longer we can keep him doing these style movements, the more fatigued he's going to get, right? So when we've captured around the guard, obviously if his knees are up, we can push our hands in here, but chances are if he's disciplined, those knees are going to be close to the chest. So there's no easy way for us to get underneath. So I've got the ankles and my elbows come inside here. Tyler's resisting. We'll do a little bit of an experiment here. Let's see how long he can resist against my full body weight here. Given the angle, I think you might want me to fall forward at this point, which concerns me as well. But you can do a little experiment with your training partners. Tyler resists here and I keep my arms straight. That's not terrible for him. It's going to gas him out. It's going to be rough, but watch what happens when we get those elbows inside. That means we can lean forward and open his legs. Tyler, resist as long as you can. You see he's got his hands on the ground here. When his hands are on the ground, we could get inside his arms, right? So again, he needs to keep basically thinking about framing against me. Tyler, resist, resist, resist. You can see that, right? So you guys can experiment with your training partners and see. I mean, Tyler's like 45, smoked cigarettes, father of seven. This isn't an athlete we're talking about here. But obviously, I mean, we'll set three seconds, but guys, this is how we can apply pressure to guards like this, right? So again, when we're coming around and we're creating our angles here, as soon as you get it, start applying pressure. They're going to have to keep their knees tight. They're going to have to keep their elbows tight. If we see some spaces here, we can start switching to the hip pocket. The hip pocket again is that ultimate goal we're talking about as a means to control. So if I'm above Tyler here and his knees are not just coming forward, but I'm able to spread his legs, this is good for me too. Tyler basically wants to keep no space here at all, right? If he allows space in this direction and his arms aren't in the way, it allows me to start reaching for the hip pocket. So he's got perfect positioning here. My elbows are inside. I'm pushing his legs apart and forward. And when he leaves this space here, we can place our hand in the hip pocket. So that'll act very similar to what I'm doing with his legs. If Tyler's trying to bring his knee in, there's a resistance there. Ultimately, I could start working to get my elbow to the floor. Tyler's resistance, very difficult here in the hip pocket. But again, you see I am leaning towards the side of the hip pocket, just like we've been doing every time we've taken this grip. Because if I over exaggerate my pressure this way, it allows Tyler to start coming around and we're in danger of triangles, right? But that's not to say we cannot block that, because if Tyler does start to move, I will keep control over the ankle. And again, we've got those hip tracks and we can start applying that passing pressure. But we're your training partners, I want you to do an experiment, right? Because we've seen how these drills can fatigue your training partners. Tyler's trying to retain guard, he has the single leg ones, and you'll see how it's fatiguing him. If you guys can do the experiment, you can do the dirty feet drill, don't let them point their feet at you using two hands. Tyler's trying to retain guard, it's very difficult for him here, he's starting to fatigue. Compare those energy levels and then compare that to when we get here. Elbows inside, start applying pressure out and forwards. We're trying to split the grain. Tyler is a big fan of the Susan Summers workout, he does crush watermelons in between his legs at home. But again, if he is trying to squeeze and I'm resisting out, that is actually incredibly fatiguing. I was actually injured by a groin one time and the exercise, the rehab was to do these squeezing holds and I could only last 30-40 seconds doing those before my groin was completely destroyed. So if I'm applying pressure outwards and he's resisting that, as well as applying pressure forwards and he's resisting that, his lower half, his core is going to burn out super super quick. So you can see how if we get into perfect positioning, Tyler, freak athlete, lasted about 15-20 seconds. So you can see how if we get in that perfect position and we're in a competition, even over a 5 minute match, if we're effective enough, we can still break our opponents down. But it's about consistent pressure, setting a pace from those positions and really just applying it over time. Pick a speed at which you can approach your guard safely and set it, maintain it, don't back up for a second. You're on top, you're applying pressure. You shouldn't have to be trying to pass, trying to pass, step back, take a breather. If you're doing that, you are applying a pressure that's too strong for you at this stage. Maybe you're not efficient, maybe you're just out of shape. But find a speed that you can hold for a long period of time and just keep attacking that guard. You can see how people begin to break. They begin to break in one of two ways. They concede the guard pass or they want to stand up. Measure your success in that. And you'll see it. You'll see guys with excellent guards that are tired get their guard pass with a simple technique. That's what we're looking to achieve here. We don't need some crazy detailed step-by-step process. If we can break their guard, and I believe their guard is vulnerable, being on bottom and the way that supine style of guard. So we can apply that pressure over time. You can develop those skills. You're going to be passing guys much better than you. But again, perfect position, straight legs, head forward, our entire body weight is directed and not just pressuring the legs back, but stretching the groin. You're going to find the hip pocket. You're going to find opportunities from that position that really, it feels like they're giving you the pass. If you do this drill and they either concede the pass and only you will know, to the outsider they might think, or you hit a really technical, detailed, multi-step pass, only you will know this. Or if they try to stand up, that means you've been successful in this game. And again, it might take you 10 minutes at first to break someone. 9, 8, 7. Measure the time at which they try to stand up or the time at which they concede the pass as you being successful and improving your skill set in this area. Let's talk about how we can blend all the versions of Tori Ando's and how we can combine them with the Pummeling to create more of a well-rounded system and more of a well-rounded way to continually fatigue, continually apply pressure to our training partners. Because again, we have to keep this pressure consistent over time. When we're stuck within the narrow framework of short time matches, obviously if a five minute match, no matter how good I am at this passing system, it's going to be difficult to really considerably fatigue my opponent. But as we hit 5, 10, 15, and even as we do longer rolls in the gym, you can measure your effectiveness at this style of passing by the speed at which your opponent or training partner start to fatigue. When we start to hear the heavy breathing, when we start to sense that panic, when we start to feel them trying to sit up or stand up, that's the measure of your success. So we can see in real time how good we are at these systems based on your opponent, your training partner's reactions. And again, if you want to treat every roll and win every roll and be that guy, submit every guy in a round as much as possible, I feel like you're going to cap your learning ability. So sometimes it might be good to apply this to training partners and actually never consolidate the pass. Just crush them with this. And if the round goes, new training partner, keep practicing these sequences. But again, sometimes fatiguing your opponent psychologically is almost more entertaining than necessarily submitting them all the time. You know what I mean? It's a new way to beat them down. So let's talk about how we can blend these together. So again, I like to reference the single axe ashi escape because again, we can use the defense to this to create an angle. Now if Tyler tries to retain guard, we can use tori andos in combination with ashi back steps. So when we consider that some of the passing movements I'm doing are just putting us in that position, there's no reason again why we can't combine these two together. So let's take a look. When I step inside the pocket here, one of Tyler's ways to want to retain guard is to bring this knee back in. If we know that, as he goes to bring it back in, we can throw both legs pass. And again, now we're starting to loop again. He tries to bring his legs back in, we've caught him in a stack. So we combine these two things very, very well. We hit our front palm. Again, we know Tyler wants to bring his knee back in because he feels much more secure with this space here being taken up. So as he does it, we can start loading him up. Again, this leg comes back in, we keep framing. He can step back into that pocket. He's really emphasizing his loading to bring his knee back in. He can create stacks, he can still walk to the shoulder line, apply pressure, he starts scrambling. We hit our front palm again. He tries to bring that knee back in. We resist it, don't just give it to him. Make him really work for it. Because again, we're trying to fatigue here, it's coming in. We step outside. So we want to keep combining these two, right? So say we're going for a toriando, we're having trouble getting connection here. So we step in to that front palm. His hips come up, he tries to bring the knee back in, and we've entered a drag or a stack. So I want you to play with these, use these drills, combine these with the dirty feet drill. And again, yeah, it's looking pretty dirty today. But again, we're going to come in like we've cleared an archie. Tyler, Tyler wants to bring his knee in, because if he doesn't I can still really start to put my knee on his belly here. So when that knee comes in, we use his momentum against him. And now look, we're back to the single hand dirty foot drill. Tyler's trying to bring his knees in. He gets the legs back and immediately creating that front palm angle. Again, shoulder line, or anticipate his next movement, and step outside. Always trying to keep at least one point of contact with his legs that creates this pressure that he wants to resist. So again, we're always pushing away. Tyler's trying to retain guard here. Again, we catch those stacks quite often. If they give us a stack, punish them for it, right? So we can throw these front palm variations in conjunction with toriandos and naturally expected responses to crush and fatigue and wear them out. Let's talk about how we can use the weave to pass supine position, right? So the weave is a great way for us to safely apply pressure to the supine player in a way that again, limits inversions, limits leg attacks, and thus improves our safety and our range here. Obviously, this will break the roll. So far, all of our passings come outside. We've been trying to stay outside the legs. We try to avoid inside because like I said, we're giving up something. But I'm happy to play inside with a weave because the weave is a mechanism to prevent inversions and if they do invert to attack the legs, we can follow up with a hip drag or we can even just use the weave to maintain distance between their hips and our legs. And again, it fits in with the overall theme of this passing series or approach to the bottom position because in defending the weave, they really have to exert themselves and it forces them to explode. And it's also, it's unique in Nogi. I won't say it's a unique passing because people do it brilliantly in the Gi, but it's one of those moves that people look at for Nogi and they just blanketly think it doesn't work. But they don't think, well, are there some things we could change to make it work for Nogi? And there for sure are some ways we can make it work for Nogi. It's just going to take a bit of finesse with the positioning of the weave hands. But again, it fits with the theme because it fatigues and it panics them and it's unorthodox and they are in a position they usually feel comfortable in, but suddenly they can't move and suddenly they can't get off attacks. So in that sense, it does fatigue them. Most of the outside style passing, if Tyler lays head to the wall, most of the outside style passing is us constantly pulling their leg away and them having to retract it with resistance here. And what that does, it fatigues the core. What we can do with the weave is apply pressure to the head. If Tyler is on his knees here, comes up to his knees, one of the best ways to fatigue someone in wrestling is obviously lots of snaps and them resisting those snaps. Tyler trying to pull his head up into resistance here, that's going to fatigue his neck. And those are two ways we can fatigue our training partner or our opponents. Someone coming to the match super well prepared, super good cardio, but if they do not technically address those two things, no matter how good their cardio is, they're still going to fatigue. So in that sense, this is a different way to approach supine that follows that same conceptual theme of fatiguing the bottom guard. So let's have a look at how we can do it here, right? So what's key about this is the direction of our fist. So if I approach Tyler's guard and I force a knee shield here, obviously if Tyler's foot is lazy here, I could still start practicing outside passing. What will happen is he'll generally try to get contact with the top foot and bottom leg here just to get some stickiness to us to control our lateral movement, especially if it's built up with tons of side to side lateral movement here. So if I come inside at all, Tyler's going to try to stick to it. And what we can do is if we see this fist here, if my fist is in line with his spine, the only way I can distribute weight is down. And this isn't applying a great deal of pressure to Tyler. Tyler can actually probably still invert and still get a lot of stuff going from here. What we need to do is we need to shift our fist towards Tyler's deck here. So we need to change the angle. We need to change the angle because it allows my shoulder to come on top of the hips. So if we compare this position here, which Tyler can really probably take this knee out and arm drag me if we were to do this. And that's where it's obviously very dangerous here. But if I keep weight onto this leg here, difficult for Tyler to move. So there are a couple of things we can do with our other hand here. If I grab the head here, Tyler will strip the grip. If I grab the head here, Tyler probably strips the grip. If I place my hand on the ground and bend my elbow into the top of his head, Tyler tries to strip it. Very, very difficult here, right? So in that sense, Tyler's resisting this by pulling his head into it. And now we're starting to fatigue him in basically the same way a wrestler gets colitis. Tyler gets frustrated. Again, the more heated the roll, the more these simple things work. The more calm the roll, the less the simple things work. And that's why a lot of hobbyists that never do hard rounds. See high level competitors teach simple techniques and they think, oh, that would never work. But when adrenaline's high, I push, they push back. I pull their head. They don't necessarily think to technically slip it. They think, oh, let me just rip my head up here. So again, the more stress we apply to them, the more likely they are to give simple responses. So when we apply this, we need pressure here and I collapse his head here. It's very difficult for Tyler to clear that grip. And I've got weight on top of his hip here. So now we've sort of immobilized Tyler quite a bit. Tyler's trying to move, he's trying to wiggle out. Very, very difficult here. So we're applying weight in a safe way. But again, he doesn't really have a guard because there's not a lot of offensive options he can do from here. And also, I don't believe he has a guard because his frames are not meaningful in such a way that they either divert my energy off of him or completely frame against it with the skeletal system. He's just basically bearing this load with his muscles here. And that's how we can fatigue from him. Sometimes if we're having a lot of trouble getting to the head, they're hyper aware of that. I've pushed my angle so much that I'm starting to come over the hips here. Tyler's actually inviting more weight pressure into his hip by really bringing his head far away. So we can sink this pressure on top. So when we approach the guard and we step inside, I create this angle here with an open chest and I'm again punching into the hip pocket. This is a way we can use that hip pocket control again here. So I want you to see how my knee, my knee cut leg turns one way and my upper body turns the other way. That's the angle we want to create. That's how we avoid being stuck in the guard here. So we've got our weight pressure, we can post on the ground. We can start to bend the head here. And this is where we want to practice being able to keep our balance here. So I can knee slide out from here. And what I do, if you pay attention to my right elbow, it's on the ground and I'm heavily weighted onto my outside hip. Why we do this is because it keeps our weight on the side that Tyler would need to use to invert here. If we get here and we immediately think, oh, let's square up. I take weight off of the leg and as you can see, potentially get triangle here, right? So we want to stay on the hip closest to the leg he wants to invert. So you can see Tyler's trying to move here. Very difficult, right? So we've immobilized the inversion and quite often by mobilizing the inversion, we mobilize a lot of leg attacks here, right? So again, it fits in with that theme. We're applying weight to them in such a way that fatigues them and makes them panic here, right? So I'm in a rush squaring up because the only thing that's preventing Tyler invert is my weight on these two legs, especially this top leg. This top leg, my entire chest is on it. And because my arm is separating his two legs, it's difficult for him to invert. For him to invert, he'd really want to bring this lower leg knee to his chest and be able to get a meaningful toe grip on the ground. He would need that in combination with less weight on this leg. So while I'm here, Tyler's trying to move, difficult. And we can actually use him trying to invert to scoop that leg up. So if you lift this leg for a sec, I've actually taken a scoop grip on that leg. If we go back a step, while Tyler's legs on the ground, I'm never going to get up there. But when he tries to invert, that knee comes off the ground. Now we can switch, Tyler still tries to move, we've got his legs controlled. Basically, it's like some form of a leg lace from wrestling, right? Because we've got this control, we've got control over the bottom leg, I can move weight into him and we can pick up this leg. And obviously this is great pinning position. Tyler's trying to explode, go crazy. That burrito is coming back up on him. So again, we're approaching the guard, we're at a safe range. I come through and we apply the angle I have here. Knee pointed away, upper body pointed a different direction. We can control the head by finding head on the ground. This is great, especially if you feel them violently fighting their head against it. We can start to slide through and I bring that elbow to the ground. Tyler's trying to go crazy, he's trying to move. It's very difficult for him to move here. He starts to go, come back, come back. He starts to go for the aversion, that opens up this lower leg. We can switch hips. Tyler's trying to move, trying to move, still a threat, trying to weight to him. He can't turn in, he can't turn away. And we can start to secure the side control here, really get a strong, strong position. If however, while we're playing around with this weak hip, maybe he's wise to it, right? So we start to come in, we start to knee cut through, we get something on the other side of the body here. And Tyler's not trying to avert, he's sort of relaxed here. This is where we can use the concept of leg riding, where I don't need to rush this big hip. So we change the angle here. If Tyler's not moving very quick, I'll still switch hips and I'll still stay heavy on the upper body and I'll pummel my legs on top of Tyler's legs here. You can see I'm using my butterfly hooks to split his legs. Tyler's trying to slow his move. We've got this great neck rise where we're using these in-between positions to control. So I've switched from right hip wave, I keep my weight on him as I switch. If I try to switch hips back to it, Tyler's probably going to get up, right? Reverse the position here. So when I switch hips, I'm leaning on Tyler's body. Tyler's trying to move, maybe super athletic, super explosive. Maybe we want to cook him more. We can start to staple these legs to the floor. So I use my right knee first, left knee comes over, and then we split those legs here. Tyler's trying to move. Super, super exhausting position here. It's one of my favorite positions against super athletic, explosive guys. And it's another position where we can think about fatiguing the neck here, right? Tyler's keeping everything safe, Tyler protected here. This is one of those positions where I can start to pull on his head. When you pull on someone's head, what do they want to do? They want to stretch their head against it. This is one of the best ways I'll start to fatigue the neck when I'm thinking about looking for a DOS. Tyler's trying to defend. So we're controlling him here. We're making him panic. I can even use my elbow here. Really, I give him a bit of movement when he stretches the head and I take it away. Tyler's trying to find a way out here. And this is such a great means that when we were to shoot a submission like a DOS, his neck's already fatigued. What's the big problem when we shoot a DOS? It can flex out of there. Obviously the more fatigued the neck is, the more likely we are to finish the submission. But again, I want you to think of the weave as a way we can pass, obviously, our previous ones when we were inside momentarily. I want you to think that this knee cut variation is a safe way to be between the legs here. Basically, giving him a little bit of what he wants without his ability to be effective from this position. So again, a lot of things come up out of the weave. So sometimes we are ineffectual with our grips here. Maybe we pass, we get over the edge and flare up and Tyler starts to invert. That's where the hip pocket grip turns into the hip drag. So Tyler starts to invert, we get that hip drag position again. But we can go for the pass or we go straight into a drag here. So if we go for this weave and the guy's so powerful he inverts, we keep that hip grip, pull and pass. If Tyler's super strong from here, we can start going back into drag. So again, we hit that fist to the floor, chest over the top here. I'm trying to mess with his head to fatigue his head. I'm trying to over exaggerate. So again, the first example we slid out, we keep him on a hip by bringing our elbow to the floor. Tyler's still trying to invert, he gives us that sweep grip a little bit and we can still consolidate the pass. If he's staying stationary here, perhaps waiting for us to flare up so we can invert. So if he's staying stationary here, we can go into our leg lock. So I can take him that knee to the floor, windshield wiper my leg lock, get on top here. Again, another in between position, not a point square position, a great control position. Here we fuck up and we start getting overzealous, we use that hip drag to guide those hips past. He inverts but because of our grip on the hip, we are making him over invert. So this is for me, one of the safest positions to prevent inversions and leg attacks. Just to give you an example of how we prevent a leg attack, if I start messing this up and Tyler gets control over this leg, takes a scoop grip, controls with both hands even, starts to invert, the hip grip, sorry the fist to the floor in that hip pocket is preventing Tyler attack my legs. Go for it Tyler. You see how his hips are always kept too far away from me here. Typically speaking he goes for an aggressive inversion and we can still start to enter that same position we have been doing out of the way where we pick it up. So again, one of the best ways if guys do get control over the leg and they are going for inversions is to stick a fist inside. So Tyler is trying to attack here, we can keep his hips away with that hip pocket grip, potentially knock this leg apart, start to apply pressure. But again I added this at the end because it is slightly different. We are engaging them at a range they can establish a guard, but that weave style hip pocket is shutting down a lot of their potential attacks from there. It's shutting down their inversions, shutting down their leg attacks and it's really again fatiguing them, making them overexert themselves in unfamiliar positions and allowing us a safe way to engage the guard while also fatiguing our opponents.
