 So we've explained some key concepts, principles, whatever fancy word you want to use, to control, to explain how we control the lower body. We've got our shelves, our tucks, our leg riding, leg surfing. We've got all of those, right? So we're using ways to control the lower body to restrict movement, but the obvious question would be what's next, right? How do we then progress? Because we have our, again, standard operating procedure, techniques leading to submissions from side control, to a lesser extent from knee ride, mount, and even from back, right? So if we're going to disregard a lot of that to learn these new skills and see how they can fit into our pre-existing game, now we need to talk about what sort of things we can do to the upper body to further progress from here. So we're going to be covering a ton. The best way to describe them is tools, right? Because our opponent is going to do things that's going to lead to opportunities to upgrade our grips with the upper body. And we're also going to be able to use those grips, grip sequences to force movements in our training partner. So combining our lower leg pins with our upper body controls is what's going to complete the entire package of control that leads to submission. So again, we're controlling, we're pinning them with the legs. That upper body is a control. It's a different style of thing we're going to do, but together is what's going to lead to ultimately that flattened out position, or if they elect to provide us a submission opportunity prior to that point. All right, option one, our first tool, the most traditional grip sequence we're sort of going to do, and it's just going to be a standard cross face, right? So a lot of people obviously use the cross face in conjunction with an under hook to pin people from a half guard to set up passes. Obviously they'll use it from side control. They'll use it to get to knee ride and ultimately mount. They can use it from mount to set up arm triangles, set up a high mount, but we can also use it from our leg riding positions, right? So let's say I've got Tyler down and we've pinned him. Let's say we've separated the legs like this. I'm on top of Tyler here. Obviously there's things Tyler can do to be active from this position, seeking to escape the position, but of course there's going to come times when Tyler just shells everything up, right? So we're going to use the cross face conceptually in a position like this, right? If we can turn Tyler's upper body away from his lower body, it's going to cause discomfort. And again, we don't need to just go like crazy and try to snap their spine here, right? We can use it to gently build pressure, leading to discomfort. They're going to seek to relieve discomfort, right? And again, this splitting, contorting the spine here is a horrible, horrible position. And again, I've got to recommend being careful with this because you see Tyler's a 56 year old yoga kung fu master from back in the day. So his spine is pretty flexible. But again, you're going to deal with some training partners who literally can't move an inch from these positions, right? So obviously twisting their spine might encourage a bit of flexibility, but it might also encourage an injury. And I'm not talking catch wrestling, crazy shit here where we're like sticking elbows into people trying to hurt them and belittle them like some Josh Barnett shit where we're putting our knee in and ripping the feet in the air. I'm talking just applying pressure. A cross face in and of itself should be kind of uncomfortable. So if we're seeking to use a cross face against a shelled up training partner here, what I'm looking to do is reach middle finger to armpit and I'm going to start to twist his spine. And that doesn't mean just using my shoulder here. I'm actually going to want to pull his upper body a little to me to allow me to have a better ability to make some strange, strange noises here. So if he wants to relieve this pressure, there's a good chance he's going to try to bring this arm to the other side. When he bridges this arm through, it makes my cross face a little less effective and it allows this upper shoulder to turn somewhat in line with his spine. I know what you're saying. You're saying, why would he go from a defensive shell to giving me what looks like a perfect arm triangle set up? It's because he wants to relieve discomfort. And again, I don't want you to read into this like I'm some sort of sadistic training partner. I want you to think about it gently applying that pressure, safely applying that pressure to encourage movement. But again, we're using the cross face to create a situation where Tyler wants to relieve that pressure. We're going to get into these other grips later, but again, you can see how we've used the cross face to secure something like a claw here. So cross face for me is still an effective tool from these positions because it can dictate which direction Tyler can sort of look into here. A perfect cross face here would involve me taking weight off of Tyler's legs. We want to keep weight on the legs, so it's going to limit the effectiveness of the cross face in this position, but it's going to be effective enough to create discomfort in Tyler that makes him want to bring this shoulder back towards us. So I would say in terms of what we're looking to do here, a cross face is a great way to create discomfort without taking pinning weight off his legs. See if Tyler's trying to move his legs here, still ineffective. If I were to commit heavy cross face pressure, I have to take weight off the legs. Heavy cross face pressure like this, he's not going to be able to easily bridge this arm to it, but he's going to be able to bring his legs back into the equation. So again, we've split the legs here. We've done a good job of pinning his lower half, but he's shelled up. This is where the cross face is so effective. We pull him towards us. I start applying pressure in. Tyler goes, I don't want to feel this anymore. So he turns back into me, basically like he's sort of bridging with just his upper body here. So what this has done is relieved the rotation on his spine, but it has now given us another form of control. So our first option is basically that cross face and that cross face can allow us to force discomfort leading to new positional opportunities. Let's talk about what that grip led into. And that was basically the claw. So the claw is a great grip in traditional back taking scrambles. When we dive for the back, we have rolling situations for the back because it reduces their likelihood and basically diminishes it to none if the claw is a good grip. Is that when we have a claw grip, when I have a grip like this, Tyler cannot bring this arm back over my head. So compared to a traditional seatbelt, which is a reduced control, when we have scrambles here I can control his linear movement. So I can trap his arm to his head and I can keep that pulled. So we can, when we have these rolling back take situations, Tyler can't start overarching this arm around. But the claw in the context of what we were just doing, what it does, it follows a principle of the lower half principle was that we're reducing either two legs or one leg from coming to his chest. So Tyler brings his knees to his chest, he's in a pretty good defensive position here and it's a pretty comfortable position. So what we've done is we've split the legs in this way, but he's still got his elbows tight. So what the claw grip can do for us in situations like this, remember we just did a cross face, Tyler wanted to relieve that pressure so he bridged into us. What the claw grip can do is allow us this open elbow pressure. So if Tyler wants to bring his elbows to his chest, very, very difficult here. It also makes it very difficult in the way Tyler moves. So if he wants to go belly down to relieve pressure here, it's going to keep his elbows open. So again, Tyler's very comfortable here. This is true in all of Jiu Jitsu. If Tyler's carrying my weight and his elbows are tight, he can talk fine, right? If his arms are away, you can hear it, right? So it'd be the same thing if he went belly down. We're going to cover some more detail next. If he's on his elbows here, that's the building blocks of building heart. He's on his forearms, and you can start to come up, right? So what the claw does is it keeps that one side elbow away from his body here. So we're further controlling it from here. You can see I'm still pinning my weight to his legs here. Tyler tries to move his legs. We haven't sacrificed our lower body pin to secure this grip. So when Tyler does bridge into me here, I don't keep this grip deep like an arm triangle here. When my arm's deep, it's harder for me to flare the elbow here. You see how he can bring his elbows in nice and tight? What I actually want is a shallow grip on the neck, and I put my shoulder on his head. Now Tyler tries to bring his elbows in. I can flare my elbow. Deep is good for setting up arm triangle submissions, but he can bring his elbows down, and you can see he's quite comfortable here, right? We want a shallow grip, and we want to trap our shoulder. We want to trap this pressure in here, so we want to trap the arm. So now Tyler's trying to move here. Now we're starting to create upper and lower body pins here. We've still got the legs split. We didn't sacrifice the lower body pin to generate upper body control. You can see Tyler tries to turn back into me. If he tries to turn to his right, the arm's blocking me. He tries to turn belly down, even worse. So again, a great form of control to keep them in this position. So what you can see is when Tyler does go belly down, that open elbow pressure really means that he can't build any height from this position, and even without hooks, it's very difficult for Tyler to start moving. So we're going to get into these details next. The claw makes it difficult for Tyler to keep that elbow close to his body. Even if you're doing this at home and you lift your elbow up above your head in any way, it's going to be much more uncomfortable than a good defensive frame. Cross face created bridging pressure, bridging pressure created the claw. Claw superior form of control in the context of a leg pin, a leg split pin to a traditional cross face. Now we're going to cover open elbows. So you saw how the claw grip, even just here, was very effective at reducing Tyler's ability to bring his elbow back to his chest here. What we're building upon here is Tyler's best defensive position is always going to be that knee elbow connection, reducing space under the armpit and the hip pocket to increase his structural integrity in a way that he can carry weight comfortably and he can explode and he can move. So if Tyler's on his belly here, flattened out, obviously the way we had stapled the legs, Tyler turning belly down meant that with weight here, it's very difficult for Tyler to build height with his knees. So we changed the angle for this. The weight here makes it hard for him to build height with his hips, right? So we're still pinning the hips just like we were if he were to turn back to his left hip here. If you turn back this way, you see we're in the same position. He turns belly down, so we haven't moved in this sense at all. So we come back a step again. We had our claw grip, right? And Tyler turns belly down. Because the claw grip, it makes it difficult for him to turn into me, but I really cannot prevent him turning away, but I can keep his elbow wide so when he turns out, he stays flat. Why this is important is if Tyler lays flat here, elbows out, he cannot build height from here. His hips are pinned, his legs are pinned, his hands and elbows are extended. For him to start to build height with the upper body, he would drag his elbows tight. Now his elbows are tight, he can lift his upper body and now he could potentially come up to his hands to lift his hands. But if we come back, if Tyler tries to lift his body from here, he needs something, right? He can either bring his knees in, even if he brings both in, yeah, now he's building height. If he keeps his knees in, he can build up to his feet. So for him to build height, he needs either his knees in or his elbows in. So if we pin his knees here, what we want to seek to do is pin his elbows out here. And as we saw, we have the claw on this side. So if he's trying to bring his right elbow in, he can't do it. My elbow is in the way, my flat elbow is in the way. And again, let's pretend we're on the other side here. So now I've got the claw on Tyler's left side. If I don't do anything about this, he can start to lift this elbow. And he can get a little bit of height off one elbow. Obviously, it's going to be difficult. But if he puts his hands on the ground or the soles of his feet on the ground, he has some explosive ability. So if we flatten him out here and I come under this elbow and I just lift my elbow, now Tyler tries to create height. We could even relinquish the claw just for the sake of demonstration to lift both elbows. Tyler tries to create height. So we've got what I would say is complete control. And what is he doing from this position when he's uncomfortable? If his legs are pinned and his elbows are pinned and he wants to create height, what's the only free thing he has to start creating height? His head. If he starts trying to build height here and he lifts his head off the ground, he's giving us easy strangles here. So we're eliminating different parts of his body that he needs to create movement, leaving only vulnerable parts of his body to create movement. So again, we're flaring our elbows here. Tyler's trying to move. Very, very difficult here. If he lifts his head at all, we can come under and obviously that's how we can start leading to submissions. And again, the beauty here is if I'm on Tyler threatening submissions and he tries to hand fight, it's so hard to hand fight. Let's contrast that with here. His hands are free. His elbows are tight. Now even if I get a deep strangle him, he has opportunity to find the hands. That's because his elbows are tight. If his elbows are flared, carrying weight and I'm here, imagine how hard it would be to fight those hands. So when we're seeking to flatten someone out, we need to control the lower body pins and the upper body pins. Obviously hip pressure as well, but you can see how the claw reduces that elbow to body connection and then when I really commit to flattening out to create movement, if we keep both elbows high, they're completely jammed in that position. Let's talk about the best grip I think we could possibly get and that would be the wrist ride dagger standing handcuff that could be special. And the reason it comes up is because of the upper body spine twisting pressures we can generate. So if Tyler's down here, obviously if he's shelled up and keeping his hands tight and we're consistently making him make strange noises like that, another option you might think is as I'm reaching, he starts to come up onto this elbow. I mean he has created movement here. This is a big movement he's created. It's just a vulnerable movement. He needs to be on his elbow because it's carrying my weight. So don't relinquish weight completely. So if you come back, make him carry weight as he gets up. You know what I mean? Give him nothing easy. And usually I find that the wrist is closer to us when we do it. If you come back, if I don't have any weight on him and he comes up, that wrist is further away to reach. When they carry weight, their elbow needs to be basically in a structurally stronger position and generally speaking, it means it's going to be this side, his leg side of his shoulder. So I'll demonstrate again. If I'm back here, he can really create height with that arm far away. And now it's hard to reach. If he tries to create height like that now, he's never going to get up. So if he wants to create height while bearing weight, he has to be structurally sound and that means we're more likely to get it here. And just some details to point out. The wrist ride is super effective, but we need to keep two hands on it to have complete control. So if Tyler starts to come up, I grab that wrist and I hold it with one hand and I start to create weight on him, he can bring this in a full circle behind his back, the other direction and he loops it like he's swimming here to clear the grip. Why he can do that is because it is a pulling grip. For me to collapse Tyler here, I pull his hand to me and apply body weight on him so we can find opportunities to swim out. So what we want to do is control with two hands. So I pull his hand and elbow to me and extend upper body pressure. So now when Tyler tries to move, we've got complete control. And when he's collapsed and it's wedged under his body, now we have a stronger grip. His best opportunity to clear it is as he comes up, if I grab one hand on him and pull it, even if his weight starts to collapse, now we can do that full semi-circle. Because we're pulling the grip down, he can swim it out. So we're making him carry weight, he starts to come up, I immediately grab that wrist. We've controlled it with one hand. We swim through, grab it with the other. I pull and push. So I pull his arm to me and I push body weight onto him here. Then I can really work to secure this grip and I want to collapse him with shoulder pressure. So I'm not too square here. I want to encourage him to go belly down so my weight distribution comes forward. And like Tyler does clean the mats here. So obviously, given what we're doing today, I've never seen them this clean before in my entire life. So we want to create that rolling pressure because again, the king of positions is them being bellied out here. And the Dagestani handcuff is what guarantees that. So you see here, Tyler even wants to, he knows this is bad technique because it's opening up the neck. But to relinquish pressure, he doesn't want to stay here because look what's happening to his head. So we can create forced errors by our body weight here. And obviously it opens up to strangles. He's not getting paid enough for this one. So again, just to re-emphasize, we want to keep weight on him and he wants the elbow post because he doesn't want us to be cross-facing him here. So he starts coming up, wrist control, forearm control, collapse him, keep body weight on the legs. Tyler's trying to wiggle the legs. Very tough here. We commit to one hand, we're rolling him. I roll my way through. So now Tyler's trying to move here. He can't move away, he can't move in. And obviously it opens up opportunities. I want to keep repeating this technique just because of those noises. But that is one of the most important grips, I believe, is the Dagestani handcuff. Again, you don't see it a ton in Jiu-Jitsu because a lot of guys don't use standing escapes. They don't think to get up to get out. They practice the preconceived notion. I'm on bottom, you're on top. I hit a sweep. Basically, a lot of the time guys will concede sweeps in the gym pretty early and stuff. They don't try to fight those pins. They don't try to fight back to the feet. So I would say we can force those movements by creating gentle spinal pressure, hip thrusting pressure. We create a pressure. Why do MMA fighters want to get up? They have that attitude, get off of me. They want you to get off of them. We can generate that pressure and create that same instinct in the bottom player here. Just by pins and rotations, they want to get up, they want to build height. So once they get up, they build height. If they want to build height, they expose the wrist to create that wrist-right Dagestani handcuff style pressure. And you can see it's just a completely debilitating pin. And again, nothing about the position I had Tyler in or I forced Tyler into was a point scoring position, but it was probably more uncomfortable, more controlling than any of the point scoring positions that currently exist in the meta of the sport today. Let's talk about half nail sends and what they are and how we can use them. And again, I'm not up to date with the IBGF rules, but I know a lot of people consider it a neck crank, stuff like that. I know a full nail send is illegal for ABCC, but a half nail send again, it's just a tool. Half nail send, if your opponent chooses to move with the pressure, they relieve the pressure. So it's not a neck crank in any way, but they're tools. There's basically, broadly speaking, two forms of half nail send. If an opponent is belly down, a half nail send could generate pressure to turn the belly up, and if an opponent's belly up, a half nail send could generate pressure to turn the belly down. Let's take a look at the first one. We'll just do a standard and then we'll talk about how they fit in. If I place a hand and a fist under Tyler's neck, look what it's doing. It's turning him here. As I straighten my arm, if he fights it aggressively, yeah sure there's pressure on the neck, but I'm simply turning him over and he relieves pressure by going with it. So if we're here, and say for the, this would be more in a wrestling context, we want to generate a pin pressure, now we just come behind the head and we can start to turn. So again, just tools to create rotation. Under the armpit, behind the head. Tyler tries to fight it, very difficult, generates neck pressure. From mount, we want to turn him under the head, behind the armpit. Tyler can't really fight this in any effective way. The straighter my arm gets, the more he has to turn to relieve the pressure. And again, we want to turn him back, under the armpit, behind the head. Why the full Nelson style is illegal is because there's no direction Tyler can really move to relieve this pressure here. Whereas obviously a half Nelson, easy to generate pressure. So Tyler brings his head this way, now we can talk about how they might come up from our pin positions here. So I'm lower on Tyler's body, so if he wants to start pushing my legs, he can reach down with his hands. But look at this exposure we have here. It's hard for him to stay disciplined. But for in mount, he can use his elbows, no space at all. So when we're back down here and he wants to push, his elbows aren't connecting here. My leg's too far away for his elbows to do an effective tow, so he's going to push with his hands. That gives us opportunity to grab it, place it on the ground. I'm shifting a little bit of body weight onto the hands. So now it's harder for Tyler to pull it out. From there, we can come behind the head, under the armpit here. You can see I'm trying to drag my fist along the ground. The higher Tyler's arm is this direction, the more I'm going to force him to belly out from here. You can see he wants to relieve that pressure, he turns the belly down. Then we can start shifting pressure to the upper body here. And as long, what do we think he's going to do? He can't move his legs easily, so he's going to start bringing his elbows back. So we need to create that high elbow pressure. We can start finding strangles here. So Tyler goes, this time I'm going to push his legs. We've got another option here. We take that grip, we strip it out and I place weight on it here. My weight's back here, Tyler can wriggle that arm around better, or again, use the other hand to clear it. If I apply a bit of body weight here, place some weight on his upper body, come behind the head, we can start to create half Nelson pressure. If one fist isn't enough, reinforce it with your other hand and you'll see my body weight shifts up. Tyler's trying to move here, he wants to go back to mount, he's like, oh, I fucked up. He can't move. So we can generate complete control with the half Nelson. Again, a lot of Jiu Jitsu purists don't really understand what the half Nelsons are. It's just a method to turn someone in a different direction. Someone's belly down, use a half Nelson to turn a belly out. Someone's belly up, we can use a half Nelson to turn him belly down. All right, let's talk about another version of a cross face. Everyone's been put in this, everyone's instinctually tried to do this to others. I know it's kind of a bully move. You can actually submit people from here. It's an arm in cross face, basically like a reinforced cross face. So let's say we're back in the leg row. We're back, we're riding the legs, spitting the legs, surfing the legs. Like I was saying, if this hand really commits to push on the knee, we've got our half Nelson sort of action here, right? But when this hand goes to push, we can actually trap this arm in to take a cross face. So if you pay attention to where his right arm is, it's trapped in. If he tries to bring it back to the other side, it's going to be pretty difficult. It's not a standard cross face where my chest is over the arm. My chest is in here. Basically my pecs are controlling it here. It does everything a regular cross face does just better. I can twist his spine pretty good. If he tries to move explosively in either direction, even though you see his belly's out here, he's bellying out straight into a re-naked here. So reinforced cross face, and again, it is when obviously this hand extending, half Nelsons, interior hand extending. I'm still keeping my weight on. I might try to use my pecs to bump him across and come around the head. And I don't want to stay too low here because Tyler will bring his arm back through and it won't be trapped. So when we wrap it up, roll your weight up a bit. You can see I've still got sufficient weight in my legs. If we ever have to take weight off the legs, slip the legs. So when I'm sitting on him, Tyler can't move. But if I take weight off and I extend, Tyler tries to move. He can't move. So if we need to jeopardize lower body weight, we want to slip the legs in. So you can see Tyler cannot turn to his right. He cannot turn into me here. If he wants to turn away, I'll open up a bit of space because I want him to. Then we can start bailing him out here. But again, reinforced cross face. Obviously it's not going to come up all the time, but if it's there, you can snatch him. And again, you can actually submit people from there. You can squeeze them. Usually something big old fat coaches do to white belts or blue belts. It's a bit of a degrading head up submission, but it's something we can all get behind as we get older. Guys, this is the most brutal part of the whole series. I'm the most excited about showing it. Actually, no, probably it's going to get much worse with Tyler. But a form of upper body control is the neck. So quite often if you watch a Khabib fight and you see him arm around the neck, and it almost looks like some primitive white belt level stuff where he's lifting the neck. It almost looks like someone that doesn't know how to do a rear naked, but basically trying to find the right pressure. But it's actually because it's a great form of control, especially from flattened out positions. If I have no other upper body grips but pressure on the neck, we can actually still pin them here. So here's a classic example. I'm flattened out, I've flattened Tyler out. I don't have deep hooks in, I'm just riding the legs here. If I put all my body weight into Tyler here, so we're fully flattening him out and I've got full body weight, but I use no upper body control and Tyler starts to build height. It's hard, but he can start to get up. If all we add in is an arm around the neck, we apply, it's not so much rotation and lift, it is a counter force for chest pressure. If my chest pressure is stationary like this, as we saw, he can come up. When I pull up on the head, I can actually apply a bit more chest pressure here. So Tyler's really trying to get up here. Very difficult. And again, I'm just going above the face here so you can clearly see it's not a strangle. But even without choking him here, I can do the same thing. He can't get up here. So this is its own form of control and we can use it to pass off to strangles. So as Tyler's trying to get up, so it looks like some meathead sort of just like pulling a guy's head off, but it really is just a control because again, if I don't have it, he can start to get up. And it comes up out of, if he's on his side here, so say for example, like what we saw earlier, if we had a reinforced cross face here, I'm applying chest pressure. Tyler turns because he wants to get belly down and get up. Now Tyler tries to get up. We can use that re-inaked grip to prevent more athletic explosive movements. So retraction, head back a little, but mostly I'm bringing my chest forward. So if Tyler's on his side here, just seated, he just turned it up, face this way. I'm lifting the head and applying chest pressure here. And that could be from here, could even be up here, but it's a counterforce so that he can't build height very easy. He can't really create explosive athletic pressure to climb up. We over rotate the head and it pins into the ground. So what might look like some primitive meathead prison shower scene type of position, it's really just a great way to keep them flattened out. Because again, it is hard work to flatten someone out and ultimately it's the best position in Jiu Jitsu. But when we flatten them out, we want to keep them there. So we need to use everything we can to keep them there. It's just one tool in the toolbox is to just extend the neck and pressure your chest forward. I thought the last scene would be my favorite, but actually this one's probably going to be my favorite. And that is the various forms in which we could flatten someone out effectively and also the hierarchy in which we could flatten someone out. So we had flattening people out with basically crab hooks, we had the perfect rear mount, two feet inside, knees flared. And obviously there's going to be intermediary spots where we have a crab hook on one side, a regular hook on the other. Or I'll show you my personal favorite, which is basically creating a single leg shelf and hipping it. So let's do it here. So for the sake of this, let's place this way. So when we're flattening someone out with a leg ride, I'm heavy just below the butt cheeks and we're flaring our legs here. So I have to flare my knees and hip in here. So this is how we can flatten someone out out of a leg ride. And you saw how that came about because basically, yeah, so we're going to demonstrate. So we're riding the legs here, tally the bellies out, immediately chest forward, flaring the legs. So I would say your success rate of flattening people out is probably going to correlate to a certain degree with your ability to have a flexible groin. Obviously if my knees can only flare this much, it's not going to be as effective as here, right? So then we have our traditional Tyler lifts up. We have two hooks in. But again, the better ability to flatten someone out is by flaring the legs because it allows us to put more chest pressure forward. Here is not as bad for Tyler. Here is much worse. And then we have various configurations, right? So single hook, but sometimes we have a single hook and a crab hook. If we have a single crab hook and a single regular hook, the crab hook wants to turn into Tyler's hip. So we want to create that tension here. So now Tyler tries to get up. You see how a crab hook is preventing movement on his left side. And then obviously chest pressure with the right. Very difficult for Tyler to build for height from here. So the hierarchy would be number one is what I'm about to show. And that is single reinforced hooks that don't just lift the knees off the ground. It's basically going to lift this whole front quad here. So I'll demonstrate on this side. So it's close to the camera. So Tyler lifts this leg up. So I'm going to lift that leg and have diagonal pressure. So Tyler tries to move. The way this is so strong is you can see how much we're kicking that leg off the ground. So if Tyler's trying to move, you can add in other forms of control. You can see we really get great back extension. So we'll do it on both sides just to even up the back pressure. So again, we're under one hook here. I'm fully weighted diagonally across. Include the Dagestani handcuff and Tyler tries to move. One of the easiest finishes in the sport. So that would be number one. Number two would be two hooks. Number two would be here. Tyler's trying to move here. Super difficult. Super easy to strangle him here. So get even a fish hook here. I would say number three is probably this flat position here because I can get so much chest pressure forward here. And then the third one would be, sorry, the fourth would be a combination. So single hook, single butterfly hook. So we're doing the best we can with what we've got. I'd say this is the weaker of the bunch, but it's easy to transfer out to number one. So it's good as an intermediary, right? So we've got the reinforced single hook. We've got your standard rear mount. We've got the ride on top and we've got the combination crab and single hook. So that would be basically our hierarchy of the rear mount. But you can see the overarching concept is chest forward pressure. We're collapsing their hips, trying to keep their legs high, immobile. And we're trying to create elbow high pressure, dagger standing handcuff to generate renegade choke pressure. Basically, if we control that effectively, they're going to feel like they have to concede the strangle. It doesn't need to be terribly uncomfortable, but again, that's really up to us and how much pressure we want to apply safely in the gym versus in competition.
