 Alright, so now we're going to be moving into a scorpion series, commonly referred to as lockdown position. And this can be a real problem. Right now, the time that you see most people use scorpions is when they're flattened out in half guard, where she's on top of me. And I go in, I lock my legs in a scorpion, and I use this as a delaying tactic to stop her from passing. She goes to put pressure on me, and I extend her, and I use it as a delaying tactic to stop me from getting passed, right? The scorpion from here is more or less useless. You can't really use a scorpion if your partner maintains the upper body inside position, okay? So from bottom position, what I'm looking to do is I'm looking to couple a scorpion with my own upper body inside position, whether I have a tight waist like so, or they have a deep underhook like so, and usually it's best with a scoop grip like so. So now from here, I can control both my partner's legs, I dominate the upper body inside position, and I can start off balancing my partner from these positions. If you use it from a situation where you're flattened out in half guard, it's mostly just a delaying tactic, a stalling tactic to stop your partner from passing you, taking off a little pressure, but you can't really go into any offense with it, okay? But when I start using it from an offensive position, or from here, I can start moving my partner around. Now it's a very difficult thing for your partner to deal with because of the fact that when she goes to base and I start to point her legs in one direction, it puts pressure on your partner's knee and it forces her to start moving around in the directions that I want. In addition, when she goes to palm of her leg from here, it's a difficult thing. I can start easily moving my partner around, I can start going into off balances, I can whip up and start going into back takes, I can take my partner over, I can start putting her knee on the floor, I can start passing her leg over my body and start creating dangers from here, okay? So we have to be able to address this scorpion from a situation where we're both in control of the upper body inside position, where my partner's just stalling and looking to stop me from passing, and we have to look to address it from a defensive position where my partner has a scorpion with a scoop grip with an underhook and looks to go into attacks where she either takes my back or rolls me through or goes into attacks with my legs. So super tricky position, we have to look to address it from each one of these given positions. All right, so the first thing we're going to look at is a situation where we are flattened up on top of our partner, we have any kind of upper body inside position, whether it be a crossface underhook, whether it be double unders, whatever the case is, my partner uses a traditional inside scorpion to start pushing me away and stopping me from getting my legs free, okay? So we're going to be in top half guard, my partner's going to use an inside scorpion, where she takes her legs to the inside and she looks to start extending me from here. If she uses an outside scorpion and she tries to lock her legs on the outside and start extending me, it's a pretty easy thing to just pull my heel to my butt and then swishing my legs in and you're free now. So an outside scorpion doesn't make sense from here. My partner uses an inside scorpion instead and now I try to pull my heel to my butt and pull my leg free, it's not going to happen. In addition, I'm going to start pummeling my legs from here, it's not going to happen. I'm going to start tripodting, she can extend me and I can't go into a high tripod from here. So I have no ability to start putting pressure onto my partner, I have no ability to start pummeling my legs, I have no ability to start going into high tripod to insert butterfly hooks from here. So it's not a position my partner can really attack me from, provided I have all the upper body inside position, but she can delay me from passing from here and it's quite annoying. So whenever I see my partner is giving me a hard time, she's extending me from here, from here I just pull my heel to my butt. We go in and we start searching for our partner's ankle, like so. I can always find my partner's ankle by just going in and taking my heel and connecting it to my own shin. My partner's ankle will always be there. So whenever I see my partner's giving me a hard time, we just pull our heel to our butt. We just catch our partner's heel like so, and now we just split our two legs. So as my left leg opens in this direction, my right leg opens in this direction, like so. And now I put a strong back heel in motion with my left leg. When she goes to re-catch my leg as I go to pummel it, we just switch our two legs out to the side like so, we move into our prime half guard attacking position that we looked at before, that we love so much, this side arm position here. Now the whole time when she goes to re-lock the scorpion, we just go in, we go into a high tripod, and now it's impossible for our partner to re-lock and go into her stalling tactics from an inside scorpion. So she goes in, she locks that inside scorpion, from here I can't pummel my leg. So I go in, the first thing I do is I back heel with my right leg and I just lift everything. I take my heel to my own shin and I expose my partner's ankle. She goes to lock on tight, we just clear. Now from here we back heel and we just make a pass underneath our own leg, like so. Now when she goes to re-expose me I move to that prime half guard passing position and I hide my ankle from the scorpion. And now from here it's a pretty easy thing to go in and start passing how we normally do. Okay, one more angle, she goes inside scorpion, she goes to start moving me around, now we're ready to go in and start passing. She goes inside scorpion, she goes to extend me, and now we're ready to start passing. So we have the upper body inside position, she's stalling, we look to expose our partner's ankle by taking our heel to her own shin, we split the legs and then we pummel our leg through to a position of safety, then we go into our prime and proper half guard passing leg position, then we go into high tripodting or whatever other pass you're going to go to from there. So now let's say my partner gets to an underhook and is working from half guard and she looks to start feeding her legs to the inside and locking a scorpion from this underhook with a half guard. The first thing I want to look to do, my partner goes to start pummeling, she goes to get under, she goes to start pummeling her legs inside and start locking her scorpion. The second I see my partner go back, the second I see my partner goes to swish her legs to the inside, I can always tell my partner is moving her legs because I can feel her movement with my lower body. So whenever I see that from here, my partner is going to look to start pummeling her legs through, I just swish her my legs and I hide my own ankle by taking my shoelaces underneath my own ankle like so. So at any point when she goes to expose the scorpion from here, it's not going to happen. If you notice, everything we've been doing from this half guard passing position is we've been turning to this side on angle to start shutting down my partner's underhook and getting to overback grips or going into whatever attack you want. So I naturally will always swish her my legs into this position anyway, where from here she gets to expose scorpion and it's just not going to be there. Now for whatever reason, she goes in and she exposes scorpion. She actually locks up and she gets to a scorpion in this position. This is no good for me from here. So the first thing I'm going to look to do is as my partner locks a scorpion but there's no tension, I'm just going to immediately look to start turning side on and I'm going to post to my partner's hip. I'm going to post to my partner's hip like so. Right from here, before she goes to extend me, I just quickly pop my knee up and I bring it to my partner's far hip like so. Now she goes to use the scorpion, she can't extend me from here. And now I play a game where I can start passing by dominating that far hip and start going in and using all the series that we looked at before. So if there's a scorpion but there's no tension, then we can start exposing the far hip and looking to go in and start passing from there. But more than likely, she puts a scorpion in and immediately there's an extension. Now I try to free my leg, it's just not going to happen. Now I have to worry about stopping my partner from going into a scoop grip. If she goes into a scoop grip, it's not going to be fun from here. So the second I see my partner go start extending my leg out and away, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to put a V grip and I'm going to start shooting my body back and away like so and blocking my partner's head and far shoulder here. Now when I go to do this, the danger is that she extends me away and then she used that to clear her knee and then pull her knee back to the inside and recover to some kind of open guard. So I back away enough where she can't scoop, but I cover my partner's leg like so. So now when she goes to start bringing the knee back inside, she can't. When she goes to start using a scoop grip effectively, I can always stop her from getting to the scoop grip with my head positioned from here. Now as she goes down to her shoulder, the one thing I have to worry about is my partner going in and starting to shove my head down with a collar tie and going into a heisting position. So I can't stay in this position. So the second my partner goes down to her shoulder and tries to lock a scoop grip, I stop her. Now from here, there's always going to be a huge gap between your partner's knee and elbow because of the fact that she's extending me away and reaching with a scoop, reaching with the hand. I stop her from locking the scoop grip and now from here, we just take our knee in like so and we just walk our partner flat. When she goes to sit up again, I crash the far shoulder and now we fight the upper body inside position. Right now from here, we can come in, we can get to our top head and arm double underhooks if ever we want from here and then we can go to that same lifting action where we pobble and we're free. So I stop my partner initially from locking a scoop grip. So she goes in, she goes to start making that move. If she locks a scorpion but there's no tension, we just go in, we dominate that far hip like so. There's always going to be tension from here. So she gets an underhook, she puts tension in and now I'm like, oh no, this is no good. So from here, I move back and away and I sit to this position. When she goes to scoop, she can't do it. Now from here, there's always going to be a separation between knee and elbow connection. Whenever I see this, we just go in and we just start moving. We just walk across our partner's body. She goes to scoop the whole time and from here, we go in and we start stuffing that knee through. Now your partner will always be able to get hands inside of your leg like so. What I don't want is an elbow deep scoop grip. This is the issue. So when I go to start walking, I walk just enough until I'm over my partner's knee. I walk, I walk, I walk. Now I'm over the knee. Now she has a hand inside. When she goes to scoop from here, it's going to be hard for me to put an underhook inside and start lifting. So she is going to be looking to start scooting down my body and getting that elbow deep scoop grip. Notice what she has to do. Go back. Watch her head position. Her head has to move towards the scoop. So the second I'm over the knee and now I don't have to worry about posting the knee. When she goes to come towards me, I put a cross face in and this will stop the head moving towards me. Now from here, I've crashed the far shoulder and I open up the left elbow. She goes to scoop. We turn our body side on. We lift, we pummel, now we pass. So she gets that inside scorpion, she wants to make a conversion to a scoop scorpion. This is no good. So we go immediately, hand in my partner's armpit, we move back and away, we sit to this position. Now from here, if my partner starts to give me problems from here, go back. If my partner starts to give me problems or she doesn't go for a scoop from this position, if she doesn't go for a scoop, we just walk. We can go and we can start body locking from here. Once we go in and body lock, it's a pretty easy thing for us to start passing and clearing the scorpion just like we just did. So my partner from here will always be trying to scoop from this position. As she goes to scoop, we initially stop her. Now we just walk. She goes to start scooping, we cover the knee. Now from this position, she goes in and as she goes to start scooping, we block her with the cross face. As we block her with the cross face, she goes to start bringing the head forward, I open the elbow and I crash the far shoulder. And whether we pommel the drift across face or whether we use that V-grip to get inside our partner's forearm, we can start flattening our partner out. And now from here, it's a pretty easy thing to pommel past the scorpion and beat our partner. So we start by moving out and away and using head position to stop our partner from scooping. Then we cover the knee. So we're letting our partner's inside knee free, blocking with the hand. And we restock the knee, walk over the knee, and we stop our partner from scooping elbow deep with the scoop grip by going with a heavy cross face and stopping the head from coming down towards the scoop grip and the leg, flattening our partner out and then passing from there. All right, so now let's say my partner actually gets to the scoop scorpion and she gets a deep elbow deep scoop grip on my leg. What can I be doing here? So the first thing is my partner goes to go in, she goes to a scoop grip, and now she goes into a scoop scorpion and starts looking to move me out and around. Whenever I see this, the first thing I'm going to look to start doing from here is I'm going to start putting my right knee on the floor. It's going to be a hard thing for me to start going in and flattening my partner out from here. It's going to be a hard thing for me to start peeling a scoop grip from here because of the fact that whenever I go to peel this scoop grip, my partner just uses that extension and whipping effect of the scorpion to start putting my, whip to your left hip, start putting my hands on the floor. So my hands are pretty much going to be occupied on the floor here regardless of what I'm looking to do or what grips I'm looking to use. So now I see my partner goes to this scorpion and looks to start moving me around, she's even looking to take me out and over to her left hip. The second I see this, I just put my right leg down on the floor like so, and I step my left leg up. The straightening of my left leg will allow me to control my partner's grip and to limp like my leg straight out and pull my leg straight out from the scoop grip. If my leg is bent, I won't be able to do this. So from here I go in, I put my foot on the floor, and now I just quickly take a grip over my partner's knuckle line and I grab either all of my partner's fingers like so, or at least four of my partner's fingers, but over the thumb is always better. When she goes to control me from here, we just go in and we just lean back and away and we look to clear that scoop grip. And now from this position, we just kick our leg back. Now there's always going to be a race to who gets the better position as I clear this scoop grip. So my partner will always be looking to start sitting up towards me. The second I see that, we just take our knee to the floor and we crash to far shoulder. So as she goes to come forwards, we just crash to far shoulder like so, and now from here we can go in and start playing a game or we can start flattening our partner out. Or I crash to far shoulder and if there's no tension with the scorpion, we just step our knee up and now we start dominating the far hip. So whenever I see my partner goes to go into a scoop scorpion, she goes underhook, she goes to the scoop, she goes to start whipping me around, she goes to whip me to the opposite hip, I just move to this position here. The second I move into this position, I catch. Now if she goes to really keep that scoop, pretty difficult thing for her to do. And now from here when she goes to step forward, the hard thing for her to do, we can go in, start flattening my partner out and start going to work. So what this will look like is she has a scoop, the second she goes to whip me over, we can go in and start playing a game where we come forward towards the far shoulder, getting to upper body grips, getting to body locks, exposing our partner and going into our counter offense from there. Alright so now this time we go in, we try to strip the scoop, but we're a day late and a dollar short and our partner actually manages to whip us to one side and looks to start moving out and taking us over. Whenever I see this what? Day late, dollar short? You're making fun of me? I see my partner go to whip me out and over and from here she goes to whip me over and before I can get my knee to the floor I actually get thrown out and over to the opposite hip and I feel like now I'm going to be posting on my elbow like so and I'm going to be in real danger now of getting swept. Understand that in order for my partner to get to top position on me she has to win the battle of head height. So if you fall down to your shoulder and your partner immediately builds to her elbow, now you're going to lose this battle because the fact that your partner's head now is higher than yours. So at all costs I have to make sure that my head stays higher than my partner's. If I fall down to an elbow like so, my whole thing from here is to always keep weight over my partner's head and shoulders. Every time my partner goes to get up I just bring my hips forward and I put weight onto my partner's head and shoulders. If I'm here I'm leaning back and away from my partner she can easily heist to an elbow and now our heads are more or less the same height and now as she goes to start lifting the elbow her head comes higher than mine I get knocked backwards and she wins this battle. So the second I see this my partner goes to start heisting up on top of me and we bring our hips forward. Now it's not going to be impossible for your partner to heist. Eventually she's going to get up to an elbow. But when she initially knocks me over it'll give me some time by throwing my hips forward towards my partner's shoulders and head and it'll give me time to start working from here. From this position as she goes to heist we take that same grip on our partner's hand. She goes to heist up, we throw our hips forward and now we straighten our leg. When she goes to start heisting I just move my hips back and away with that same straightened leg and we pull our knee straight out like so. Now there's going to be a race to getting up to top position. So from here the second I see my leg is free I swish my hand out I build to a hand. Now when she goes to beat me with head height my head's always going to be higher than hers. Now as she goes to start building to a hand we can look to start going in and we can play a couple of games. We can post on our partner's top leg and we can step over like so. Now we can play from here. Or depending on the tightness of my partner's legs we can pull our leg free so we can heist up to our knees. Then as she goes to get up we pull our leg free and now from here we can go in and start playing a game where we can go in and start body locking our partner or whatever you want to go in and whatever attacks you want to use from there. So whenever I see my partner goes to roll me through from this position there's going to be a battle of head height. If I fall to my shoulder and she goes to get up you're losing every single time. So from here the second I see my partner goes to fall to a hip I immediately thrust my hips forward and I close my knee down to my partner's shoulder. So when she goes to get up it's going to take a few seconds from here. I grab my partner's hand as she goes to get up I pull my leg free. Now from here I either one if my partner's legs are pinched so tightly so tight together I can't extract my leg the knee is closed I go in I step over like so. This time I try to step over my partner opens the legs we pull our leg free. They play a dilemma based on my partner's knee position. My partner's knees close down towards the floor. It usually means I can't pull my leg free from here like so. So if I try to heist it's not going to be possible. From here it's a pretty easy thing to push the leg down come forward over the legs and start riding the legs. A lot of times your partner will stop you from riding the legs or just be generally trying to heist up. So she'll be trying to pull her leg back into a heist. We both heist from here and now we're in a game where we're going where it's under her or I go to a double leg or whatever the case is and we start fighting from there. So I play a dilemma based on my partner's knees. If the knees are pinched together I ride the legs. If the knees are splayed apart I heist and go into attacks. It's all about one as my partner goes to whip me through maintaining head height. My head stays higher than my partner's head and the whole time as she goes to heist I'm putting weight towards the head and shoulders and then from there we have to use that few extra seconds we have putting weight on the head and shoulders to strip the scoop grip extract the leg and then play a game from there. Alright so now one of the worst positions we can be in is when our partner locks a scoop scorpion she puts my bottom knee on the floor and she passes the leg over across her body. Alright so let's take a look at this now. So from here she moves into a scoop scorpion she extends me with the scorpion and she puts my leg into a situation where she can now take a two on one and pass it over onto her opposite shoulder like so. I'm going to a scoop grip usually above my knee into this position here. Now my legs are exposed my back is exposed this is not a good scenario for me to be in. The first thing I like to start doing is addressing the scoop grip. Okay so I'll go in and I'll look to play the same game we looked at before where I address the scoop grip and from here I like to start turning and pulling my leg out and away. Now if I can do that great I won't always be able to do that. A lot of times my partner will use two hands to control my leg so when I peel one scoop she'll use the second hand arm to stop me from pulling the leg out and now from here it'll be difficult to start playing a game where I can beat both my partner's arms. Now I can go back and forth we can play a grip fighting battle where I get to beat one it fails I get to beat two and then from here I just go in I start playing with one of my hands versus two of her hands and a lot of times I can strip both quickly and pull my leg out but a lot of times I can't because she has two hands versus my one. Whenever I see my partner moves me into this position what's next is going to be my partner trying to switch to an Achilles grip. A lot of times as my partner goes to stop me to an Achilles grip on the transition is when I can pull my leg free and whip it out. Okay so you can use an opportunistic approach where my partner goes to switch from the scoop to an Achilles and then I can look to start going in and taking my leg free. Now once you get to an Achilles okay now things start to get interesting from here okay if my partner can look to start to put my knee down on the floor and look to start extending me like so and my knee comes down towards the floor like this now my back's exposed my legs are exposed this is going to be no good for me. Okay so the second I start moving into situations where my partner locks an Achilles grip I'm going to look to come in and look to start pulling my partner's Achilles grip down. Okay as my partner goes to start to extend me I'm going to have to have a post hand with my right hand so she goes to extend me and I have to post with my right hand to not fall over. From this position we go in and we just catch our partner's thumb like so and when she goes to lock that strong Achilles I look to start pulling my partner's arm down into a situation where I can start dropping my knee down to the floor. When my partner goes to keep that Achilles grip up nice and high we just go and we pull pull pull and now from here we can either one just take our leg free or more than likely she'll have enough control where I can't get my leg out to the floor or my leg completely out and look to start facing my partner. So from here I just pull myself into this position. Now my partner goes to extend me I'm leaning relatively onto my partner and it's hard for her to start knocking my right hand to the floor. So we just catch with the right hand we just slide our right knee or left knee down to the floor and end up in a situation like so. Now my back is exposed from here. At any point she posts my armpit she can come out and start to climb up to my back. I can't have this. So the first thing I want to look to do from here is we look to start going in and punching in underhooks. When I get to one underhook with a head block or I get to double underhooks I start going in and passing from here. So first shift to this transition my knees pointing straight up towards the ceiling my partner switches to an Achilles grip like so. She's extending me away putting my hand on the floor. So what I want to look to do from here is I want to look to start to sit onto my partner in this position. The problem is the Achilles grip is a little tight from here. If I just sit here my partner can still off balance me pretty easily and start to move me around. So from here we look to pull that Achilles grip down like so just far enough where we can pull our heel in towards our partner's hip and then sit comfortably on our partner like so. Even with the Achilles grip when she gets to move me around from here I can base out on top of my partner. And now from here we just lean and pull, wait, not Achilles, we just pull the Achilles all the way through and put our knee on the floor. Now from this position we go in and we punch an underhook in place and as we get an underhook in place from here we're in this kind of interesting predicament that we find ourselves in from this position. Whenever I find myself in a situation like so we look to start going in and we play a waiting game now where my partner goes to start extending me with the scorpion. She can't because she has no upper body inside position. And now from here I play a game where I either one start playing a waiting game where my partner goes to switch her leg position and I free my knee and I can pass. Or if you feel like you need to go into a pass quickly or transition quickly we start playing a game where we can start going in and pulling our knee across the opposite side. Okay and now from here we can get our leg back to the same attacking position in the traditional half guard. So we can play a game from here or either one. Usually I play a waiting game because it's just in such a strong position that when your partner's legs actually do come out you can free your ankle you can actually free yourself from here. I play a waiting game where she goes to move me around she can't and from here we just go in we just pump pump pump pump our knee comes free and now we're passed. If I feel like my partner is just holding on for dear life I want to make something happen whenever I see this we just go in we start leaning forward we take our toes up to the floor. We go into a high tripod from this position and from here we just look to take our left knee and shin across our partner's hips. As she goes to hold me and extend me away you just slide everything across and now from here we can go in and start going to work. All right we have our partner flattened out and we lift and we peel the scorpion. Okay so now this is if we can stop our partner from exposing our back and get to an underhook or a cross face or double underhooks whatever the case is from there. Assume my partner now goes to an inside scorpion takes my leg across we end up here we put our knee on the floor. This time my partner looks to start coming up and going towards my back so whenever I see this we just go in and we just sit on our partner's hips like so. We sit on our partner's hips like so. Now as my partner goes to start building towards my back what I don't want is for her right hip to start coming forward towards me. So I make sure I pin my partner's right hip like so. Now from here when she goes to get up I'm sitting physically on top of my partner's hips and now I have to free my left ankle. So from here she goes to look to start to extend me. I play a game where I look to start going in and posting on my partner's legs in various ways. So from here one from here I post and I extend my partner's leg further than she wanted to go. So she goes to extend me I straighten the leg all the way and my foot comes out. So if she goes to extend me I hyper extend her leg or from here it goes further than she wanted to go we power leg through. A lot of times it won't work she'll go to extend me and from here I feel like the foot's just so sticky I can't get it off. Whenever I see that again we're just playing a game from here as my partner goes to move me around and the foot comes in we just post on our partner's foot. We pull our foot in this time we post on our partner's foot and we just quickly pummel our foot to the opposite side. This is going to be a position that you're going to be stuck in for long amounts of time. Okay when your partner has a scorpion just trying to work from there it's not one thing where I oh let me just quickly pump my leg and I'm out. My partner's gotten to his scorpion switched to a scoop grip passed my leg across. You've made some mistakes from here. Okay whenever I see my partner get to a scorpion now my legs on this side your partner's halfway to your back from here. So I stop my partner from going in taking my back by sitting on their hips. When she goes to get up it's not going to be easy from here. Now as she goes to extend me we pummel the leg through. Now once the leg is through we free our knee. Let's start turning a corner now we can start sitting on our partner and going into cross ashi grami situation. So I free my leg the second I free my leg I immediately tuck my heel in to save to hide my ankle once again. And now from here we go in we play a game where we start stepping our leg up and now we can start creating an angle where you start going into cross ashi and we just start passing half guard from these positions. Conversely she has a scorpion this time I try to extend from here she goes to pull the knees back into the chest. Whenever I see this I pull with her I just catch my partner's foot like so. Now she has to keep a strong scorpion she goes to extend me we just go in and we click and we flick the foot off. My partner goes to extend me from here as she goes to extend I just push and pummel. And now from this position we can go in and we can start going into all different kinds of attacks with either outside ashi or just split apart his legs or you can go and push to a scoop, spit her out and start going in and going into attacks on the legs or going into attacks with guard passes. So my partner passes the leg across. As she passes the leg across first thing we're trying to do from here is strip the scoop. Whether we go she has an ankle deep or whether she has an ankle scoop or from here we go in and clear the scoop or she has a knee. We clear the scoop or she uses two hands we go one she goes to switch or we go two and we start fighting in our partner's hands. This time she switches to an Achilles grip. When I see the Achilles grip she goes to extend me move me around or face down on the floor. I pull my partner's arm down like so start sitting into this position. She has an Achilles she's trying to pull it up nice and high we just pull that knee through and now from here we can go in and start a passing game. Or from here we either play a long game where my partner is trying to move me around and we just wait until we can eventually get that ankle free and as the ankle comes free we go in and pass. Or my partner's trying as hard as she possibly can to hold on to me. I feel like I can't make anything happen. We start working into a high tripod. Now from here she goes to extend me we take that knee across and now from here we're ready to start working. Or I can't get to any upper body inside position my partner goes to expose my back. From here we sit on our partner like so. From this position my partner goes to extend me we push the leg all the way straight and pummel our foot through. or from here I go to push the leg straight she pulls the legs in from here we turn towards our partner now we just catch our partner's foot like so and we just use that to flick our leg out and free. Many times when I go to start getting to my partner's foot and pushing it out she goes to extend then we use that push on my partner's knee and play the two together. Between one trying to push my partner's foot out with my foot like so or two she goes to extend we just push everything on by. We just move our feet around until we can get our foot free from this position and once our foot is free now she's about sitting back onto your partner's hips clearing the knee and now going into attacks with leg locks or of course going into the passes we looked at previously. Alright so our partner passes her leg over this is a position that is starting to get kind of tricky from here. Your partner's managed to lock a scorpion she got to a scoop grip she passed the leg across it's not looking good for you. There's leg exposure there's back exposure there's sweeping exposure it's going to be tough for you to recover from here and it's not one of those things where it's like oh here's one simple solution which will instantly get me out. You're going to be playing a longer game from here you're going to be stuck here for a long amount of time and you have to wait until eventually a pommel opens up where you can start to move from here. You're so well wedged in place with the scorpion that's not just like oh let me just clear the scorpion and now I'm out. She has control of both your legs she has control of the hips and she has a trial element between sweeping leg locks and back attacks. It's a very strong position for her. These are some of the options that we have to start getting with our partner who passes leg across from the scoop scorpion. All right so now going into intro from half intro to deep half guard. All right so now we're going to go into diving into we look at scoop scorpions and that's kind of deep half guard as well but just diving into a traditional deep half guard. Both of my partner has a traditional lock of the legs and looks to start pommeling the butterfly hooks and moving out to the back door. I'm moving at the back door and trying to start exposing my back. Now let's look at a couple different things and positions with deep half guard. I start moving into a deep half guard position the person on bottom can play with a couple different hand positions a couple different leg positions and they can play with a couple different body positions. They're going to either one play with usually a scoop grip like so and either a tight waist or a grip here on on the leg. They can be facing toward you from bottom position where now I'm basically facing my partner. They can move into a deep half guard where they're flat on their back they're playing from here or they can move into a deep half guard where they're facing away from their partner like so and usually when they're facing away they look to take the hand from monitoring one leg to monitoring the other leg. So now from here they can start moving out the back door and start coming up with a single legs or attacking their partner's back and going in to other attacks like so. So they can usually they'll usually play with three major body positions facing you flat on their back facing the ceiling or facing away from you like so. They can use hand positions where they monitor one of your legs and they control one of your legs like so or they can use scoops where they control both of the legs and hips a little bit easier from here. They can also force one of your knees to the floor or the other. Right now I'm going to deep half guard she has her top leg on the floor. I can also play a game where I like to start going in and shooting her bottom leg to the floor whether it be with a scorpion whether I go in and start locking my hands and pushing that bottom knee to the floor or now from here things change a little bit. So she can play either with bottom knee on the floor like so top leg up or she can play with top leg on the floor and bottom knee up and our attacks and defenses from top position will change as my partner goes to move through these. All right so we're going to deep half guard now and we're going to look at all these different body positions, leg positions and hand positions that our partner can play and how to address them and effectively deal with them and go into defenses and counterattacks and eventually getting past our partner's guard. So now we're going to look at general goals for the bottom player when they're looking to go into deep half guard and look to start to off balance you. So once you can understand what they're trying to do it's a lot easier to balance yourself and look to counter from there. So when your partner plays from a deep half guard they have a couple of general goals from here. The goals are built around either one looking to start off balancing you out to the far side and coming up and looking to expose your back. So they'll look to go into deep half guard then they'll look to start coming up and however it may be they either come out the back door and they move into some kind of single leg and they move to your back or whatever the case is and they come out the back door and they start going into leg attacks and back attacks from there. Number two is that they'll use the threat of moving out to one side to get a push back reaction where as I go to start taking her out to this side she uses a post and I feel like I can't start coming out in this direction and she goes to push back towards me and then from here I quickly whip up to attack my partner's legs and either single legs or I go to attack my partner's back, she puts the wizard in and now we're wrestling from here and let's start coming up into attacking positions. So we use a pull push dynamic where I either try to come out the back door and attack my partner's back or attack my partner's legs or I whip up quickly towards my partner and go into her legs or go into her back. So I play this game where I use these rocking motions to start coming in, start rocking my partner out from one side to the other and I play a game where I look to start going in and exposing and getting into attacks. And finally from here there's always a relationship that we have with going into Ashigurami and leg entanglements from here where I try to rock in one direction and it fails, I try to rock in the other direction and it fails. And at some point from here I pommel a butterfly hook into place and now from here instead of going into attacks on my partner's legs or back we look to start extending our partner out dominating the space between my partner's knees and then from here going in and going into Ashigurami X guard entrances and going into attacks on either our partner's legs or using it to go in and sweep and get up to top position. So there's going to be a couple general goals in mind and it will always start from rocking side to side. Whether we use for rocking motion to come up towards our partner and go into the legs of the back or take them out to the opposite side and come out the back door and if those are failing or you just want to go into your partner's legs finding ways to fight your legs to the inside position and then going into X guard Ashigurami and working from there. All right so now let's look at the relationship between a couple of these different leg positions we've been looking at and understand that they all kind of flow together pretty well from here. If I try to go into a scorpion for example I go with an inside scorpion I look start taking my partner out and looking to get her out of off balance and go into my attacks from here. Understand that at any point I can start whipping my partner back in the opposite direction and I can transition from a lower leg shift or from a scorpion into a lower leg shift and then quickly build up from here and start going into all my attacks. So just because you stick with one of these leg positions doesn't mean you have to stay with one of these leg positions. If I go in here and I start going into a lower leg shift and from here whatever the case is my partner's knee gets trapped back inside and she pushes herself back in so now there's no lower leg shift we can go into a scorpion and we can start off balancing our partner out in the opposite direction. And if at any point we lose a scorpion and we end up in a traditional deep half guard it's not really that big of an issue from here. We can always go in and we can whip back to a lower leg shift or we can make conversions where I start off balancing my partner side to side and I switch to a scorpion like so. We can use a scorpion to start off balancing our partner. We can use a scorpion to start going in extending our partner out and away putting the knee in the floor and now from here we can go in and start entering into ashi gromi and going into attacks my partner's legs. So understand that your partner, I've been teaching them all separate entities, understand that your partner can start chaining these together and using these leg positions with chain attacks. So just because she starts with one doesn't mean she has to stay with one. Just because my partner uses a scorpion initially to off balance doesn't mean that at any point they can't transition to attacks my legs. Doesn't mean that they can start going in and playing more traditional deep half guard from here. Doesn't mean that they can't start whipping you out in one direction coming back to the other making a transition to a lower leg shift and coming up and going into attacks on your back or on your legs from here. So understand that there is a relationship between all these different various leg positions. I've been teaching them as separate series but when you're dealing with a high level player they're always going to be chaining these leg positions together one after the other as you go into your counters. So you defend one they switch to another. You defend the other and they switch back to the first one or they go to a third one. So understand that there will be these chain attacks together moving through these various leg positions as you counter one or the other. All right so my partner is going to go into a deep half guard and we're going to start initially with our bottom knee down on the floor. Okay so we can have a bottom or top knee down. Our bottom knee is going to be down first. So my partner is going to shoot into this deep half guard like so. She's going to put my bottom knee on the floor. The first thing I want to do is I want to prevent two things. I want to prevent my partner from instantly inserting a butterfly hook inside my leg like so and I want to stop my partner going back up going in and putting a scorpion in where she takes her leg to the inside feeds to a scorpion and now starts to extend it. Whenever my partner locks a scorpion and gets a butterfly hook it's going to be bad news for me. Okay so the first thing I want to do first thing I want to do from here to defend my partner from locking a butterfly hook is I want to take my knee again same thing as a regular half guard. I'm going to take my knee I want to just put it here my partner's outside hip like so. At any point when she goes to start putting the butterfly hook in it's not going to be easy from here. Okay the further my knee is from my partner's hips and the closer it is to my partner's near hip the easier it will be for her to pommel and get a butterfly hook to the inside. So the first thing I want to do to defend the butterfly hook the second my bottom knee goes down I just shoot my knee right to my partner's forehead here. So when she goes to pommel inside now it's not going to be an easy thing. Okay now to defend a scorpion my partner will always look to have her legs locking in and she will look to start switching to a scorpion. She can use a post on my Achilles with her right foot to start taking my ankle out to make it easier to expose that ankle to the scorpion and then I should go in and lock up. So similar to lock up half guard, just keep that. Similar to the first move where I take my knee to my partner's forehip I'll take my knee to my partner's forehip to defend the butterfly hook and then I'll make sure that my shin runs along the line of my partner's hip line here. So I'll physically hide my ankle. What I can't have her doing is to step on my ankle to expose it or now I can't take it back in now she can drape the leg over and lock scorpion. So the first thing I do my partner shoots into a deep half guard I put my bottom knee in the floor she puts my bottom knee in the floor by shooting into deep half and as she goes to shoot into deep half she goes to use exactly cross lat pose and she uses an extension of her legs and she shoots, shifts my bottom knee down to the floor. Whenever I see this we immediately take our knee glue it to our partner's forehip and hide our ankle from being exposed by taking our shin parallel to our partner's hip line. So that our shin now is flush across both our partner's butt cheeks and it runs along the line of my partner's hips. When she goes to start pummeling and butterfly hooks she can't do so. When she goes to pummel scorpion there's no ankle exposure and now from here we can work comfortably knowing that we won't get exposed have my partner put in butterfly hooks above my knee and off balance me to x guard hashi garami or sweep me or go into scorpion start whipping me back and forth and start putting me into more compromising positions from there. So I initially stop a butterfly hook and a scorpion my bottom knee is down in a deep half guard. Alright so very similar to the scorpion I'm just going to go through this real quick just so you guys know maybe you watched the scorpion section a month ago now you're watching the half guard section now it seems kind of redundant for me because I'm teaching it within a half hour of the last dealing with scoop grip but I'm sure for you guys it's a good refresher. So we go in she moves to a deep half guard I hide my ankle and my knee for a butterfly hook and a scorpion and now from here the second my partner goes in and scoops my leg we just take a grip here over our partner's knuckle line and we just take our body out in the way. We straighten the leg and we just peel the scoop grip on by and now from here we take our leg back as my partner goes to sit forward we can crash the foreshoulder and from here we can expose upper body grips we can expose my partner's waist or we can go in and start to look to go into body locks which we'll look at going into attacks from there later. So just initially going in she puts my bottom knee down we peel the scoop grip we extract the leg we crash the foreshoulder and flatten our partner out or at the very least get our leg free and start to work from there. Alright so a great option we have from here when our partner starts to put our bottom knee on the floor and either pommels a butterfly hook in or maybe they just keep their leg lock their legs locked so I can just go in and start to move right to standing passing. So whatever I see I just don't want to engage in this deep half guard type of game I don't want to look to start passing half guard traditionally whenever I see this my legs scooped up high like so we can just go in and immediately start standing. Whenever I see this we just take our foot down to the floor like so and we immediately just start going in and we just start standing up to our feet like so and now from here my partner can't off balance me unless she switches to the inside position with her feet. So from here she has legs locked and she'll start moving me around from this position it's a hard thing to do the only way she can do so is by pommeling the leg to the inside and now from here she can extend me and off balance me. So I just wait in this position from here and my partner will always she's good to pommel to the inside position as I go to stand up. So when she goes to unlock her leg and pommel we just go ahead and we start back stepping from half guard and now you're into more of a half guard or a X guard passing game and you're loose passing in different series but just understand that you can always convert from a deep half guard into a standing situation where you're loose passing and you can make a conversion into X guard and passing Hachigurami with standing loose passes. Whenever my partner puts my bottom knee down like so we just go in we take a V grip on our partner's ankle if she has a butterfly hook like so same thing take a V grip on my partner's ankle so now as I go to stand when she goes to extend me she can't do it if I go to stand here she goes to extend me I get severely off balanced. So it's more imperative my partner has a butterfly hook that when I go to stand she goes to off balance she can't do so because she can't bring her heel away from her butt and now when she goes to start moving me around from here we just start passing once she has her legs locked I stand she goes to pommel and we start passing okay making a conversion from an attempted tight pass down in half guard to a loose pass with standing passing so she goes to start moving me around from here I stop the scorpion she goes to start off balancing me then I can go in and start playing a standing passing game just making a conversion from a tight pass my partner shoots into deep half guard I can't get tight chest to chest we stand up and we start passing right from there. Alright so now my partner's going to go to deep half she's going to pass the leg over with two on one and this time my partner doesn't have a scorpion so it's going to be a lot easier okay my partner passes the leg over with the scorpion it takes a while they actually extract my leg but from here if there's no scorpion and she passes the leg through again we can go and we start peeling that scoop grip in addition because there's no scorpion if we want to we can just start standing up right away and going into into into loose passing if my partner has a scorpion in place I can't take my knee off the floor so when I try to stand up I just I can't do it I'm going to extend it so instead she just goes into a half guard if I want to at any point we can just go in we can pose on our partner's ankle like so now we just lean our weight from one side to the other we just pop up like so and the danger from here of course is that my partner is going to start going in and start exposing my back and taking legs through that's why I always make sure I keep a V grip here so when she goes to get her knee behind my knee to expose my back she can't do it so from here my partner goes to start moving around and from here we can either one I usually look to try to free my top leg first if I can step out I can step back into my partner's guard or from here if my partner goes to start bringing knees inside and from here we just go in and we immediately start to step past our partner's shoulder line and go in and start beating our partner the problem is from here if she goes in then she pommels knees behind she grabs my ankle now it's hard to step out I play a game between pommeling one leg and pommeling the other based around where my partner's tension is and the stickiness in her hands then she has to move me around from here we can get one leg free and start passing so if at any point you want to make a conversion from a tight pass and half guard to a loose pass standing you can just stand up from here there's no scorpion whenever I see this my partner goes to move me around we just convert to loose passing so we stand up she goes to start moving me around and we're back into our loose passing from here we can kind of reset and get back to a good position now this time my partner goes in she takes a leg on by and we can go in and we can play that same game where we peel up on her scoop grip where she goes to scoop and we use either one hand to clear or she pommels and I'm hand fighting I clear my scoop grip just like we did with the scorpion okay this time she makes a conversion to an Achilles lock like so now from here she doesn't have nearly as much ability to off balance me because there's no extension with the scorpion when she has to push me this way she can't do it okay so now from here we use a stronger and more robust underclasp grip this grip where I grab over my opponent's wrist is decent but it's much stronger when I use an underclasp grip so I just go in she goes to move me around I post a hand I use one pull to put my knee on the floor and now from here if I can get chest to chest it's the easiest thing in the world to free my leg because now there's no extension so when she goes to keep my ankle trapped the knee comes free every time she can pinch her legs do all the things everybody likes to do it means nothing and now from here we just go in we free our ankle so if we can get chest to chest whether it be with the top with the head block whether it be with double underhooks whether it be at the top head and arm it's a pretty easy thing from here my partner goes to trap trap onto my knee my knee from here the pretty easy thing to start freeing our leg okay if I see that from here I can look to start freeing my knee right away with a top head and arm and my knee comes out and I pass many times I'll have to use a post hand so once again we can switch to the head block scenario or from here we look to start clearing and once we clear if we want to go back to a top head and arm we can if we want to make a conversion to double underhooks we can okay and once the knee is free it's a pretty easy thing to start making your way past in addition to this you put our knee in the floor and now from here because our ankle is not trapped anymore it's a pretty easy thing to start going in and going into attacks on our partner's legs whether it be going in and falling taosa nashi dorami whether it be scooping and spinning cross nashi whether it be scooping and spinning to a back stepping position or I can go in and start passing from here there's a variety of different things we can do okay but because my partner no longer has a scorpion it's a much easier position to address I just sit into this position I post the hand and I use an underclasp to pull my partner's wrist down she goes to control me I put the knee on the floor now from here we go in we get chest to chest if we can do that great if we can get chest to chest with two hands occupied now from here we look to go in and we look for our partner to start unlocking her legs so once she does my knee can come free more than likely she won't unlock her legs from here so I have to make a transition whether I started with top head and arm or whether I started with double underhooks I have to make a transition to a head block and use a post hand to free the knee or now we can go back and convert to any kind of pass and upper body position that we had before and if at any point my ankle or sorry my back goes to get exposed my partner tries to scoot up towards my back we just sit and cover that far hip and now from this position it's a pretty easy thing to start going in and creating threats on our partner with passing or positional pressure to go into our winning positions and get either a finish with a submission or a pass so my partner actually makes a pass over from a deep half guard but there's no scorpion it's a pretty easy thing to start countering from there the scorpion pass over is much harder because of the fact that my ankle is trapped now she can extend me and move me around it's hard for me to pummel my leg and then to get into position. Alright so now we put our top knee down in this deep half guard and the first thing we're going to have to do is deny my partner ankle exposure okay so what I don't want is a situation where I end up in a deep half guard and my top knee is down and my partner looks to start exposing my ankle with either one of her ankles because now from here she can start moving me around she can start feeding into situations where I get deeper bites and now I can start transitioning to x guard or now I can start lifting my partner in one direction I can start extending her in the other direction and everything starts to go south from here so whenever I see my partner shoots into a deep half guard I either put my top knee down or she forces my top knee down the first thing I want to do is I want to deny my partner the ability to pummel her ankle underneath and inside my ankle okay so how are we going to do this whenever I see my partner shoot into a deep half guard and my top knee is down first thing I want to look to do the second my partner shoots into the deep half guard she has legs locked up like so is I want to immediately post on my partner's knee I want to just slide into this position here where I take my my ankle and I connect it right up right to my partner's hips like so the further my knee drifts down towards my partner's hips the more ability my partner will have to either expose my ankle or to expose my knee and if she exposes my knee with a butterfly hook this is not what I'm looking for here okay so the second my partner shoots into this deep half guard I just lean all my weight to my elbow and I focus on denying my partner ankle exposure like so now my partner will always instinctually post to my knee kind of shove my knee down and create that either trap of the knee or go back or she'll shove it down and create ankle exposure as she's shoving it down and now look to start going in and then she'll bring her knees back up a second time now she has knee exposure this is no good for me but we play a game where I initially deny my partner ankle exposure and then as she goes post to my knee I know she's going to do that and we can start to go in and expose under hooks all right the second she goes in she goes to expose my ankle we just move to this position here where now my knee goes and starts drifting towards my partner's far hip now she goes to start pushing that ankle down that knee down we get we know it's going to happen we have a situation where we know exactly what our partner's response is going to be and we can act accordingly to go into all of our counters so the first thing we do when she goes to shoot into a deep half guard and my top knee goes down is I immediately deny my partner ankle exposure by taking my ankle my foot and just connecting it to my partner's hip as high as I can and making it difficult for her to get her ankle inside and underneath my ankle all right so now this time we go to deny ankle exposure we look to start exposing an under hook on our partner now there's a couple ways we can do this number one is of course we play a game between denying my partner ankle exposure and every time I partner goes to post to my knee she will always inherently expose an under hook so as she has to push that knee down she goes in and now she exposes an under hook now the problem with this under hook is that I can't really use it to flat my partner out from here it's hard to get a cross face because my partner's ear and my thigh are connected even if I get a cross face my partner rocks to one side now I start getting off balance it's hard from here so I put an under hook in place and I have a post hand here so when she has to rock me she can't rock me in this direction so I put an under hook in place but I don't actually look to get a cross face and an under hook and solidify a chest to chest position because of the elbow deep scoop grip okay so I go in the first thing I look for is I deny my partner ankle exposure she goes to post to my knee she exposes the under hook the second I get the under hook we immediately take our ear to our partner's shoulder like so I don't want her to have an under hook she just pommels her hand back inside now uses that to off balance me or get her on under hook whatever the case is so we go an under hook like so we just glue our ear to our partner's shoulder she goes to pommel one side she can't do it and from here we take our elbow and we tuck it inside our partner's armpit and we bring our own elbow to our hip like so and now from here when she has to pommel that hand back inside I have good control of that arm okay the first one is we deny ankle exposure she goes to start pushing my knee down and from there we go in and we start to expose our partner's under hook now if I deny my partner ankle exposure and she doesn't take the bait of trying to push my knee down and she has the hand inside like so this is fine we use a blade hand we blade our hand like so and we just punch our hand through doesn't matter how tight you tuck that elbow we go in we just punch the hand through if we need to we can go in and we can go one two three four we can just punch that hand through or she goes to keep a tight elbow tight elbow like so she should be looking to push my knee down but if I feel like she's not pushing my knee down no problem we just go in and we go in one two three four we expose our partner's under hook like so and immediately as we punch everything through we take that ear down she goes to pommel one side and we lift everything into a situation where now it's difficult for my partner to use that to go into any effective offense and we can start making transitions into Kimura and going into our attacks from there okay so two ways to punch an under hook either one playing a game where we free our ankle from being exposed to our partner's butterfly hook when she goes to push the knee back down with her with her hand we just put the under hook in place or she has a tight elbow she's not taking the bait she's using a tight elbow when she's flat on her back punching in with a blade hand and going into attacks with under hooks and then switching eventually to Kimura which we're going to look at right now this is a very basic way to punch an under hook when our partner is flat on her back facing up towards the ceiling all right so this time we're going to look to make a transition from our under hook into a Kimura so now my partner has the path guard we deny that initial ankle exposure and again she'll always have that those legs up nice and high this time we go in and we get to that under hook like so and she looks to start moving the arm around now it's a difficult thing to have a post hand she has to start whipping from one side to the other she can't do it she has to put a butterfly hook in and she can't do it and it's a pretty good easy thing for me now to start going in and starting to go into my attacks so now once I attack once I start going in and locking Kimura we pull the arm towards us and now we just switch elbow to elbow and from this position once we have Kimura locked now now no matter where my partner goes I have a strong Kimura locked she has to off balance me it's a pretty easy thing we start posting my head and it's a hard thing for my partner to start working once I have this Kimura in place okay so I put the Kimura in we make a conversion to a Kimura and now we can go into attacks with Kimuras with passes with triangles etc etc all right so now let's look at setting up a Kimura when our partner has an under hook but usually in a situation where we go into the pass we end up here and now my partner starts using under hook to start coming up and start she's facing me now so now from here it's hard for me to start inserting my own under hook because of the fact that she's not on her back anymore she's facing towards me whenever I see this we just go in and we just catch elbow to elbow on our partner like so so now at any point my partner goes to pull her elbow back it's not gonna be impossible but it's gonna be hard and this gives me more than enough time I just go in my hands here she's not really thinking anything of it but she doesn't feel immediate danger now when the time is ready to go again we have that ankle that I had denied my partner ankle exposure we pull that elbow up she goes to pull it back takes a takes a second and as my partner goes to pull the elbow back I slide from elbow to elbow to elbow to wrist and now I make a switch my elbow comes through she goes to start moving the arm around now wherever she moves it we lock kimura and we're ready to go in with our elbow attacks so she has an under hook this time like so from this position we go in we go elbow to elbow we slide wrist to elbow and then we expose our partner's elbow to our opposite elbow we go elbow to elbow one wrist to elbow two elbow to elbow now when she goes to recover we lock the kimura now ready to go into all of our attacks so we can expose the under hook and then make a transition to a kimura when she's flat on her back and her partner's facing us with her under hook we use an elbow to elbow method to expose the kimura lock it up and then go into attacks all right so once we have this kimura locked plenty of attacks we can go into all right first let's say my partner just freaks out about the kimura and the second I lock kimura what happens is from here my partner takes her other hand and she physically grabs her own hand to stop me from putting the kimura behind her back whenever I see this I immediately shoot my knee down below my partner's shoulder line and I hit one of two transitions number one is I put myself back into a half guard where from here I just go knee to hip and we move back into a traditional half guard where now I have the kimura locked and we're ready to go in and start attacking with kimura like we did before two the second I see this we immediately shoot our knee to our partner's hip and as we do that we make a transition where we punch under hook in place we shoot our knee back to our partner's hip and we can make a conversion to a top headed arm and now from here we go forward crash the far shoulder look to flatten our partner out and get them to pass it so if at any point my partner relinquishes this scoop grip and grabs their own hand with the kimura which is pretty common we either use the kimura to flatten our partner out or we use the kimura to switch to a top headed arm so whenever I see I lock kimura my partner's like oh man I don't want to get my hand put behind my back so she grabs her own hand the second I see this we just flatten our partner out or she goes to grab her own hand we flatten our partner out now ready to go in and start attacking from here okay that's number one number two because our knee is free from this position it's a pretty easy thing to just start falling to our hip keep my leg locked let me pinch your knees and now from here we're in a t-kimura position or now it's a pretty easy thing as my partner goes to move from here she realizes the leg control has no effect she lets go of the leg now take a transition to t-kimura and we start working from t-kimura okay so we can go and just fall to our hip and switch to t-kimura should we want to and then my personal favorite we have kimura locked from this position we start playing a game where we start scooting underneath our partner's head like so where now from here we play with our hantai and oshiro game or from here my partner goes to start coming in scissoring her legs to get on top of me we go in there we go for hantai senkaku this time my partner elects to keep her legs in the same position and now from here we just look to start scooting out and around the corner like so and now from here we either stay with the kimura or we make a transition into a cobra and now we start creating an angle where from here we use our second foot to free our ankle she goes to keep it trapped pretty easy thing from here to free our second ankle and make a full switch to oshiro senkaku okay understand that if you're in this position and your partner wants to come up on top of you she has to unlock her legs and scissor them to get up on top okay but don't worry about your leg getting caught if she tries to just roll up on top of me from here she won't be able to do it she has to scissor the legs good and as she goes to get up on top we finish with either just kimura where you can roll up on it for a second time or go into a hantai dilemma okay so when we go down into this position and i sit i'm trying to make a decision between going in unlocking hantai or locking oshiro if from here for any point we see my partner go to start scissoring her legs as my partner's legs come open we just flip our leg over if at any point we miss our we uh we miss the timing and my partner goes to get on top of me and we feel like the triangle is just not going to be there just focus on keeping the hand behind your partner's back so now wherever your partner goes from here she takes her head to my far shoulder like she normally would she's gonna start passing the side control we just roll our partner through a second time we finish in either a back crucifix or t kimura or now we can start going into all bar taps so we set up this initial kimura from deep half guard once we get this initial kimura like so we'll have to start scooting underneath our partner like so now from here she has that uh that lock in my legs if she elects to stay in this position we start leaning taking our legs out and now from here we go in and we start going into all of our shiro senkaku work if from here i'm going to start leaning my partner looks to start coming up on top of me just start scissoring her legs and as she does we just go in we follow our partner with hantai senkaku and now we can start making all the proper adjustments to go into finishes if at any point my partner goes to scissor her legs and i forget my foot on the inside she has to start scissoring her legs i forget my foot and it gets trapped now from here just put your partner's hand behind your back whether she ends up in half guard side control doesn't make a difference as she has to come forward the kimura behind the back will force your partner to either get broken or you can roll your partner through finish that situation or now you're on top in the driver's seat with the kimura locked and ready to go so we play a dilemma game between if my partner keeps the scoop grip a dilemma game between using the kimura or trial of the game between going to a t-kimura whether it be just falling to a hip or if we mess with the hantai senkaku rolling our partner through or playing a hantai senkaku and uh an oshiro senkaku dilemma if our partner rolls on top of us we have hantai senkaku if they stay in their back we switch to oshiro senkaku just like we did before and if at any point my partner freaks out about the kimura grabs their own hand and forsakes the scoop grip and we just flatten our partner out we use the kimura to pass from there or attack from there or we go into a top hat and arm and go to work all right so this time we're gonna look at someone who tries to whip up towards us and start going into single legs or back attacks or whatever the case is so she goes into a deep half guard she starts rocking me from side to side and what she wants from here there's no ankle exposure but she wants from here start to whip up towards me and go into single legs so she goes in a situation like so she whips up no other way she flips up and she goes into single legs right now from here she can come up and either go into attacks on my legs or attacks on my back okay so understand what has to happen here if she has her own underhook like so she rocks me in one direction and then she goes to rock me in the opposite direction understand as she goes to come up what has to happen is my knee has to drift across to her inside hip like so so many times if there's no ankle exposure she can't force my knee to that hip by just rocking so what she'll do is she'll take her left hand and she'll go elbow to elbow deep on my knee and as she goes to rock she physically passes the knee across and from here she gets the knee to the inside and now she's in a lower leg shift or now she can either build up or start rocking me across in the opposite direction so whenever I see I deny my partner ankle exposure my partner goes to start whipping up to this position I know she's going to start coming towards me because she has a knee to elbow connection so from here when she goes to start whipping up towards me we just catch our partner's elbow when she goes to whip up and pass that knee across we just lift the elbow we just dominate our partner's forehead like so once we dominate our partner's forehead from here it's a pretty easy thing to stop her from coming up when she goes to get up we just sit towards our partner's forehead and now from here we just go in we lift the elbow and then we go in we lock Kimura and go into our series with Kimura once again okay we play a game where it's hard for my partner to start exposing me to any attacks so she whips in one direction as she goes back she tries to get my knee to that inside hip so the second I see this she goes to start whipping we just lift like so you put weight over our partner's forehead so when she goes to heist she can no longer do so okay if she goes to heist and she lets go of my leg we just move right to knee on belly because she has to keep my leg trapped from here we go in I make a switch elbow to elbow Kimura goes in place and now from here we play right from there so my partner goes to use a hand assist to get my knee to the proper hip we lift the elbow keeping our knee in the forehead dominate the forehead and make a transition off for initial attack into our Kimura series. So now like we talked about there's going to be a relationship now between deep half guard the lower leg shift and this Ashi Garami so my partner uses deep half guard and try to whip up towards me into a lower leg shift and tries to come up and start attacking me with leg attacks or back attacks I counter this by taking my knee across my partner's forehead now what this does for me is it allows me to keep my partner pinned and stops the initial attack the problem is if she moves to a lower leg shift both my knees are relatively close together she comes up and she makes a transition with a scoop grip and she moves to this lower leg shift notice from here my two knees are right close together so there's no threat of an Ashi Garami because she if she can't get between my knees she can't expose an Ashi Garami so the problem is is that when she goes to whip up I have to stop her from coming up by splitting my legs and dominating the far hip so what will happen here is now because my legs are split she brings a knee up the middle she uses a knee to start extending me out in the opposite direction she inserts a butterfly hook and now she's into all of her attacks so whenever I see I split my partner's legs I dominate the far hip and the knee comes up the middle the second I see this understand your partner will have to open up her legs to try to start pummeling her legs inside if your legs are split your partner is always going to try to separate the legs and get a butterfly hook in so your partner will always open up the legs the second I see this my partner goes to start extending me from here I open up my knee and from here I just pummel the front pummel right through the middle when she has to start recovering now it's a pretty easy thing to just land knee on belly we're now wherever she goes to start moving from here it's a pretty easy thing to start taking knee and elbow together the scoop grip now is useless and we can come forward and get chest to chest and start passing her partner whenever I see my partner tries to whip up towards me and a deep half guard I counter it by dominating the far hip she counters it by bringing the knee up the middle I counter it or as she goes to extend if I keep my knees pinched together she goes to extend me and she moves me so I point my knee in the same direction she's going to extend so when she goes to move me we just pummel through I point my knee she goes to extend I front pummel and now from here it's a pretty easy thing to make a transition to our partner's upper body however it may be and go into our passes right from there so she goes to whip up from deep half we're in here she goes to start whipping up controlling my my knee position I lift she goes to bring her knee in the middle the second her knee comes in the middle we switch from the elbow to the ankle she goes to expose my knee to a butterfly hook we pummel through and now from here we're ready to go in and start our passing game so I counter her ability to come towards me I dominate the far hip she counters by bringing her knee up the middle because I'm splitting my knees I counter with the far v-grip and a front pummel all right so this time my partner starts trying to uh take me over to the opposite side you okay there just it's like day 16 of filming so don't mind her she's just an idiot she's a little slow sorry okay so now this time she goes in she starts taking me to the opposite side so we covered everything coming up towards me in this side now she goes in and starts moving out and over into this direction like so from here my partner will always look to start transitioning where she starts moving from this leg to my opposite leg now if at any point my partner doesn't uh she stays with the scoop grip and doesn't make a transition onto my opposite leg but from here she starts going in and starts making a transition to this opposite leg if at any point my partner stays with the scoop and her head stays on the floor like so if at any point you want to and you can I can just go in and start stepping over my partner's head like so and start going into situations where I can go in and explode my partner's legs so if they'll have you in the ground and there's enough space for you to step through you can always do that the problem is there's not always enough space for you to do that so from here what will happen a lot of times like your head will be glued to your uh to your thigh you try to step over you just can't do it try to push the head down you can't do it so what happens a lot of times as we're playing this game where we're kind of stalemated from here I get my ankle up to good position and now from here she starts going in and rocking me and switching from one leg to the other like so whenever I see this now I know she wants to come out the back door if I stay here she just comes out and starts exposing me and beats me from here so the second I see she goes to make a transition where she goes from one leg to the other now my leg is no longer controlled the second I see this we just immediately go through we take take a scoop on our partner's knee so now from here I can beat my partner's knee what I don't want is to sit through and I can't beat the knee okay so I slow my partner down by scooping the leg so when she goes to get up I just slide my knee to my own heel I lift with a scoop grip and now when she goes to start beating me from here there's no way she can beat me and they either fall back to cross ashi or start going in and playing a positional game from here so my partner goes start taking me in the opposite direction now from this deep half guard she goes to shoot into initial deep half guard we get the knee for it we deny ankle exposure she goes to start whipping up to the other side the second I see this we go in and we scoop that far leg when she goes to get up she goes to take her head out as she has to take as she has to take her head out from here we use that scoop to lift the knee she has to extract the knee in order to get up so when she goes to start taking the head out she has to take that leg out high stuff and now she's on my back or on my legs so I stop her from extracting that leg with a scoop grip so from here she goes to make the transition as she goes to make the transition we go to a scoop she goes to start coming out we use that scoop to lift knee to heel connection forming a closed wedge around my partner's leg and now from here we can go in and start attacking a partner's legs or go into positional attacks with half guard passing. All right so this time my partner goes to whip up and come out the back door by taking me across to the far side how can I stop my partner if I miss the knee and I can't lift the knee okay of course if I can always beat my knee and get underneath my partner's knee and lift with a scoop grip she can't heist. Let's say she gets halfway into a heist how can I stop my partner from getting up on top of me but she's down she goes to go in she goes to make a transition where she goes from one hip to the other she switches legs and now from here I try to go into the scoop I feel like I can't do it and her head starts to pop out all right the second I see this I immediately focus now on dominating my partner's top hip just in a little bit different way we stop our partner coming up towards us by shooting our knee to the far hip and dominating the far hip and making it hard to heist it's the same idea here the second I see this I immediately take my right knee and I just shoot it my partner's far hip but now when she goes to heist and extract that bottom leg it's a very difficult thing to do from here many times from here you'll be able to lift and now this is all happening quickly you'll be able to lift either on the outside on the inside and you can start going in and lifting your partner's leg while pushing the hip flat and moving into that same position we were just in many times you won't be able to do so so from here you dominate the far hip she goes to heist as she goes to heist now I go to the bottom hip and as I switch to the bottom hip I step over my partner's legs and now when she goes to heist she has no ability to get her head higher than mine it's a pretty easy transition from here and start going in and flattening my partner out okay so again we're sticking with the same idea of dominating my partner's top hip so she's down to deep half she goes to make a transition or she goes to the far hip she's facing away from me she switches legs and now from here the head comes out the second I see this I try to go in and lift this far leg she can't extract the far leg this bottom leg from here there's no way she can heist but I miss it this time the second I see this I immediately slide my knee in and I cover my partner's far hip with my right knee so now as she goes to heist she has to extract the leg she can't and now right from this position we immediately go in as she goes to start heisting from here we just lift our body up we post on the knee as she goes to start heisting we step up and over nice and easy and start to work from here so what this will look like in a little bit faster sense as she goes to start whipping from one side to the other the head comes out we step over and now we're ready to go or she goes to start whipping over to the opposite side as she goes to do so now from here we can expose our partner's leg so sitting on top of our partner and control our partner's hips okay so whenever I see I can't beat the bottom leg with an initial scoop grip and stop my partner from heisting up then knees gonna come out then instead of focusing on stopping the bottom knee from coming out I stop on I focus on keeping the opposite hip pinned so I pin the far hip with my knee same as before just in a little bit different position and then from there I either use that to transition to a scoop grip or lift the leg or I use it to start dominating my partner's bottom hip as I step over and start going into leg drives three-quarter mount things like that all right so now we're gonna look at stopping our partner in a very similar way from sweeping knee or coming out the back door getting to my legs with a butterfly hook but she actually does expose my ankle from here okay so this time she goes in she goes into deep half and before I can do anything she exposes my ankle or she actually gets underneath my ankle like so now she goes to start rocking me she goes to make a transition and now she extends me out in a way where from here it's gonna be much harder now to start doing going into any of my my defense because the fact that I'm so extended whenever I see this the first thing I do is I can't just try to go to my partner's far head it's too far away so the first thing I do to counter this butterfly hook is I just first pull my heel into my butt here so now the extension has very little effect so the second I feel I go to start extending me I don't turn back towards my partner and end up here or now my back is exposed big mistake everyone makes instead she goes to extend me I pull my heel to my butt and now as she goes to start heisting now I dominate the far head now when we both go to get up it's a very difficult thing for her to beat me and we can start winning that battle so the big mistake everyone makes is they try to turn right back into their partner without first addressing the butterfly hook this is it looks simple when it's taught but it's something that messes people up all the time so from here she goes in if she goes to a start extending me she goes to switch legs and from here I try to face my partner if I try to dominate the far hip from here and she goes to get up I get extended too far and I lost this battle every time so instead the second I feel that butterfly hook comes in I'm thinking about heel to butt address the butterfly hook first then pin the far hip okay so from here the second she goes to extend me makes to go make that switch she goes to start moving me out in a way we palm of the leg free we address the butterfly hook first hip second if you just try to turn back towards your partner you're gonna lose every time so you have to as she goes to make this switch the second she goes to switch and the head comes out here now when we both go to win top position I crash the far hip and that's a pretty easy thing to start telling you to all my counterattacks with either submissions or positions okay so heel to butt kills the butterfly hook she put the butterfly hook in she creates ankle exposure she overextends you if you get extended you won't be able to get to your partner's far hip so first we beat the butterfly hook so that she has no ability to extend you away and then you have free reign take your knee to the far hip pin the far hip and recover so now this time I partner actually doesn't even just create ankle exposure she creates knee exposure where she actually puts a full butterfly hook into place and uses that to start moving out the back door whenever I see this it's gonna be more difficult now to start dominating my partner's far hip okay the problem is if she goes into a full butterfly hook she starts moving out in a way now from here she switches legs and now you know keep the breath up okay now from here you see there's such a neat gets such a good knee elbow connection that when I actually go to beat my partner's butterfly hook she just extends me out in a way that's hard from here to get into a situation where I can beat my partner's knee with my foot and shin because the knees so far close to the chest she just goes to build up now and I get beat from this position so many times what happens is you try to you try to use the same method when your partner has a full butterfly hook in she goes to extend you out in a way from here I try to go into that same pommel but your partner just quickly whips up and now you get beat from here all right so it's not really smart to start using that same escape provided your your knees exposed rather than just your ankle so whenever I see my partner go to it goes to extend me out understand a difference in leg positions here if my partner just exposes my ankle she has the ability to keep me trapped with my with her legs the full way through so understand that from here she has a wedge right now on below my ankle and she has a wedge on top of my ankle so when she goes to whip to that side notice from here she has a control point at both the front and the back of my ankle so I can't do anything about that now as she goes to switch legs she goes to come out she goes to extend me and now from here I can beat my partner now it's different when she uses the full butterfly hook when she uses a full butterfly hook and she's underneath my knee now when she goes to control me with her second leg it's hard to do when she goes to start extending me from here only one leg controls me she only has a wedge now behind my leg not in front of it right so what this means is if she goes to extend me in this direction and she goes to switch my legs from here it's hard for me to get to my partner's forehead it's almost impossible now she just posts her left or right leg on the floor back she just posts her right leg on the floor she extends me and heist up and now you're getting beat from here okay so it's hard to use the previous escape because of that reason now if I try to use this escape my partner has only the ankle exposed I won't be able to do it because I won't be able to free my leg but I can use this escape my partner has my knee exposed with a butterfly hook because now once you guys start extending me she gonna start switching legs from here we just post on our partner's ankle and from here we just go in we step our leg right out and right from here with a high step we just go in we start passing our partner's hip line and then going into various pins depending on what your partner's gonna do from there so whenever I see my partner exposes me and exposes my knee to a butterfly hook rather than just my ankle she goes to start whipping me out to the opposite side she goes to start making a transition from one leg to the other we just step our leg right free and now from here we can back step out and we're out and away I know it looks simple but you have to understand the difference between your partner having your ankle exposed and your partner having your knee exposed if your partner has your ankle exposed they can keep a wedge on top and on bottom of your ankle the whole way through so you have to use one escape where your partner goes to start extending you out you pull the heel in you dominate your partner's forehead that escape won't work if your partner has a wedge behind your knee with a butterfly hook then it's much better to go into high steps all right so just to recap she goes in she gets just my ankle exposed from this position she's a wedge the whole way through so she goes to start extending me out she goes to switch legs you get to our partner's forehead we start feeding her from here this time back this time she has my partner my knee exposed if I try to do that go ahead I can never get to my partner's forehead so from this position as I go to get to the forehead she high step and I get beat from this position if my partner exposes my knee to a butterfly hook now as she goes to start making the transition she has no control over my over my upper and lower leg my top the top the front of my leg in the back of my legs and as she goes to start extending me we just step right out in the way okay so through one your partner has more control of your leg because she has control of the upper and the lower leg behind the knee but she doesn't have a wedging on top and on bottom of your leg so it makes one escape easy when your partner has a butterfly hook and one escape is much easier when your partner has just the ankle exposed with the butterfly hook where she starts to extend you out so you have to be cognizant as we're going into these escapes and passes where your partner's leg is positioned relative to your leg that you have a full butterfly hook behind your knee or just a butterfly hook behind your ankle.
