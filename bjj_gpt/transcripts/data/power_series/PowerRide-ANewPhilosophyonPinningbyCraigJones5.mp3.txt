 Alright, we'll talk about how we can find some of these leg rides, these leg pins from traditional positions. And the first one we'll do is side control. Side control, I believe it's a very overrated position. I believe everyone, again I've emphasized this throughout, everyone's overeager to get to side control just by the nature of the point scoring framework we operate in. And that is that passing the guard is hard, so we want to pass it and we find ourselves in side control. But let's assume we're in side control and our training partner started to recover. And rather than allow them to recover to somewhat an offensive position like a half guard or a butterfly guard or even a close guard, or even sometimes guys will recover with an elbow escape where they have a submission threat, things like on the platter, some guys even start to get a knee inside and attack arm bars from here. So my philosophy from here is when side control starts to recover, let's use their recovery as an opportunity to re-pin their legs. So I have Tyler here, let's look at it from this angle. So if Tyler starts to get his inside knee inside here, he starts to hip escape, he brings that knee in. This is where I'm talking about where we can be a danger, right? Tyler can start throwing a lot of platters over the top and really interfering with our positions here. So what I want to actually do is rather than bring my knee across to knee right, we're going to bring it across and as he starts to hip escape, I flare my knee and create an escape all over the place. So you can see here now Tyler's escape internally is dead and it's dead because we've put a limit on the amount of his right knee that can come inside. If my knee is here, he can create an effective frame inside and he can use that to begin escaping already a long straight of this submission. So when we're here instead of going knee rush, I'm trying to safe hold his leg here. I'll get a clear safe hold and then we can reinforce it. And now again, test it out on the training park, Tyler tries to move. This is the extent of his explosive ability here. So we're in our side control, we're starting to sense this knee going back in and we cover it here and then we reinforce it straight away. And I remain over the hip because again, if this knee comes here, we can get off balance and we lose our control positions here. Another version of this very similar right, is if he does bring that inside knee inside, let's not fight the inside knee. This is why I think people get some of the recovery positions wrong. Sure it's the inside knee that's our problem here. Obviously, if it's not inside, side control, if it's inside, he's recovering. And a lot of people will become, their mind will be stuck on being like, how do we address this one? But really, if you look at Tyler's position here, his greatest vulnerability will be to pin the top leg. So let's not even address this if it comes inside. I'll look to cover the top leg and step over the top, always putting as much weight on the legs as possible. Even if I start down here, I'm quite low on Tyler's body. I keep weight on it to pin it for a step to start climbing back up. And now Tyler's, I would argue, is in a worse position than the side control position he was in because now I'm generating effective pinning pressure. And we can do a number of things here. I'm stapling the legs. I can use my other foot to prevent his knee from bending even further. So Tyler's trying to move here. Very, very difficult. And you see he actually wiggled himself into a perfect staple separated leg right here. So again, sometimes it's not within our interest to aggressively pursue controlling the inside knee, which again, typically is seen as our problem. Because once this is in, the legs are back in play. Obviously I've beaten the legs from a guard pass. We're fighting the upper body, leg comes back in. Now we're back in the danger zone. But I would argue that if this knee comes in, our path to repinning them is to control the top leg. So again, I'm trying to hold Tyler down and inside knee comes in. I immediately cover that top leg and step back so we can step over. And I've stepped over in such a way that my toes are curling around his top leg, limiting his exposure of his feet to the ground. So again, we're not going to stay here forever, but I am heavy on Tyler. I'm heavy here. And then we start windshield wiping and climbing out of the leg up. I could stay two legs on top here. You'll see Tyler's got a pretty good ability to move here versus if he starts really wiggling around his lower body and would come back to center versus if I use the base of my foot to extend. Now he can't curl his feet to his butt at all. So we're both straightening the leg and riding the leg. So it's another great option from side control to generate another form of pin. Another one would be obviously Khabib style, but this would be more of a reverse Keza Ghatami. If we're pinning a guy and he's on his side here, we're pretty stable. He's knees in the way too. What we want to do is pull him onto his side here. And again, this is a situation where you'll see guys going for truck rolls and rolling back takes. But in my opinion, if we're on top, we want to try to remain on top of the best of our ability. Perfect world, we're on top, we submit them from top. We don't have to jeopardize top position in any way. So I would actually recommend picking up both legs, stepping over both legs. And I won't go straight to the Khabib right. So if you pay attention to my bottom knee, my left knee here, I won't step straight up and cross my feet. Oh, actually, so we've stepped over, I'll shelf his hip here. So we're taking his hip off the ground as well. It creates a bit more spinal rotation here, right? With his right hips on the floor here, his spine is actually straighter than if I shelf this leg and cross my feet. When his spine's manipulated, when it's rotated, it's harder for him to explode out of this position. If Tyler wiggles around here, he's quite pinned as opposed to, he is still quite a good pin, but you'll see he has ability to start wiggling and extending a bit more. So when we're setting up this Khabib right style, I want you to step over and shelf that hip before you come across here. And when we're on top, squeezing our legs as tight as possible, trying to drape our chest across there, body here. Because obviously, right, the principle contorting the spine, if his legs are here, for him to generate some comfort, he kind of wants to turn into us here. So if we want to generate more discomfort, I can use my chest on him here. And again, that leads us back to those opportunities where if Tyler really wants to emphasize turning into me, he might have to come up to an elbow. And that's what starts leading us to further grip exchanges. So we look at it from this side as well. So we're now basically our reverse kese gatame, where ultimately under these elbows here, the higher up the elbows, the better pin position. So instead of doing the, I say traditional, but I guess it's still some form of body grappling would be trap one leg and ultimately look for rolls. I'm looking at actually trap two legs, look here, lift that hip there and shelf it, pinching our knees together, not killing your feet. So again, Tyler's trying to wiggle around here. You can see it's actually a great control position here. And then we can come up, pinch our knees together, apply body weight forward and we're in a much better position here than if we were in a traditional mount. Tyler wants to relieve that pressure, he starts looking to sit up, he's looking to push it over and we can start generating that wrist ride and rub it his motorbike into the green. So guys, this is three options to create leg rides out of side control. Two of those were sort of defensive reactive. One of those we found ourselves in a reverse Kezia Kitame looking to set up a Khabib style ride. We covered side control, let's cover mount. Mount obviously can be one of the strongest positions in all of Jiu Jitsu, especially if you start getting those elbows high, but it can be difficult to control fresh guys in mount. If I'm dealing with an explosive athletic guy and I pass his guard immediately and I land in mount and he has that uncontrollable fresh energy, it is very difficult to control. You'll see good guys sometimes have to hold a guy in mount for a very, very long time before they're able to win the hand fight and progress up the body. So when we are in mount, we can almost take a step back and to find a superior control position where they can be less athletic. So we've already spoken about this earlier, but we'll just touch on it again. So if we're in mount here and Tyler hits a knee elbow on his left side and he starts to hook this leg, the way I see it is anytime someone turns onto a side, they're taking a risk that we can potentially keep him there. If Tyler's on his side, it's harder for him to use his feet, it's harder for him to be explosive. So if we come back a step, just to refresh it again, his feet are on the ground here, he can bar, he can bridge, it can be hard for me to control, especially like, again I use example, Nicky Rhodes, probably the most athletic guy in the sport. And this is probably where I learned some of this stuff is that like, it's sometimes easy to control a guy like that, not in these traditional positions. He's got a crazy wild kick, bro. But if Tyler starts hitting the knee elbow escape, starts to get that kick back in, he's taking a risk being on his side, let's step back and keep him there. Now if he's trying to do an athletic explosive movement here, much, much tougher for him. And we've ended up with a foot inside, sampling the lower leg and a foot on top and weighted on top of the upper leg. So again, we've created a situation where it's unfamiliar, it's hard for them to explode and they really have to take unusual risks to find a way out of here. But again, we always talk about connecting it up. So if Tyler say he can effectively push this leg and he starts clearing that bottom leg, we keep riding his legs here, looking to staple in any way we can. Again, if he starts turning back into me here, if he turns back into me, we landed a half guard staple again. So we've got situations where we just need to take a step back and hit from the elbow, let's trap those legs together. Let's trap his knees together, let's sit on his legs here. Let's see if they have the same explosive ability from these positions. Chest heavy pressure or if he starts finding effective escapes, stay on the legs as much as you can here. Very difficult for Tyler to be explosive here, freeze one leg, stay on the legs here to start to fatigue him. So obviously we also have kipping escapes we have to deal with. That's probably one of the reasons it's so difficult to control mount without some form of underhook. So let's see Tyler, you can hear a kipping escape from here. If I try to hang on too long, he gets that guard back. The beauty of the kipping escape as opposed to other escapes is he can go from weak position to submission threat very, very quickly. So if I start feeling he's getting that kipping pressure, I will try to try to keep his legs to the ground here. And I can be sort of unorthodox in my approach. So Tyler's kipping here, he's creating elevation, I'm trying to surf the legs any way I can here. So we have an initial staple and then we try to reinforce it. And that way if either foot gets pushed out of my hands, we're always riding with a second leg. So again, we have many opportunities from the kip as I start to kip, try to pinch your knees together and lead them onto one side here. And we can start stapling and riding the legs here. As we take mount, we don't even commit fully to the mount. Sometimes we'll have unorthodox positions where we're sort of in a mount, but we're not in a mount. Sometimes you feel like you have superior control here and you feel like you can control your opponent and you have the waiting game where they're trying to time you bringing your feet to the ground to go immediately to a hard guard. And it's a question of if we feel like we're in control here, why progress to the mount? Why we're in control here is because my weight's positioned on Tyler's legs in such a way that it's hard for him to grip because he can't put his feet on the ground. I'm spreading his legs here so it's hard for him to keep it to one side. So it's actually a great control position in and of itself. But let's say he starts to push one knee down, he can just keep pummeling to remain on the legs. So there's no issue here. So it's one of those situations where Tyler's trying to commit a lot of energy to get very little and we can start pummeling and reinforcing our legs here with stack pulls. If he over commits, we can start spreading the legs even more. So we have some situations there from mount where we can use a knee elbow escape to control both legs. We can counter a kipping escape by trying to bring them onto one side and again, staple pin those legs to the ground. We have a situation where we're about to pass the mount and we feel controlled, but basically we're pressured into going to mount because that's the standard operating procedure, even though we feel in total control prior to that point. And if we stay in that gray area on the legs, even if they do escape, we can continue to surf the legs, continue to fatigue him, put him in unorthodox situations. All right, we've covered side control, mount. Let's talk about knee ride. Knee ride is not a position you see a lot of people overly use in Nogi because of the chances that if the bottom player can invert, they can go straight to leg entries. But it doesn't mean we can't at least use this position to bridge into other leg riding styles, right? And there'll be two sort of styles we can do. We can force them to commit one direction or we can be reactive to a knee elbow escape from this position to create a leg riding pin on one side. So if I landed on knee ride on Tyler for a second, what I was saying about heel hook entries is if I don't keep my weight position correctly, Tyler can invert straight to the legs. But what you saw when he did that, his knees have to come and then his hips come. So he has to use his knees to create inversion pressure. So obviously if I distributed some weight back into this direction, gone is the inversion ability. So let's face it. So if I hit knee ride on Tyler here and I take my foot down to his knee here, we can start to hop and turn him to one side. Remember we always staple with one leg, get our balance, reinforce it with the other. And again, we can go foot over foot or feet separate here. Whatever feels like it gives you the most stability in that moment. Obviously feet apart increases our likelihood of separating the legs, but feet together is going to be a more concentrated weight distribution, making the pin probably more successful but less room for your opponent to move and make bad decisions for himself. So again, let's say I land it in knee ride, immediately use my foot to hook as close to the knee as possible. I won't turn him from down here, but I will turn him from that highest point. And then we can bunker down and keep our weight back on the leg right. Another option as well is if I'm hitting so he can invert but he starts to knee elbow escape. We can bring our leg back across here. So as that knee elbow escape comes, I'm just separating and reinforcing straight away. Again, Tyler's trying to move here. We've created a very strong style of pin here. When knee ride is something like this, I turn my knee to the legs to create an initial staple. We reinforce it and then we can start adjusting to separating or pinning style pressure. So again, we have an active and reactive entry into leg rides from knee ride. Again, being cautious of your opponent's ability to invert because they can go straight into leg entries. Let's look at a situation where we have back control. Say we've done something like a chair sit and it's a back control where our opponent is on top of us. They start to do a traditional style escape where, let's say for example, we've fallen to one hip. They start to beat the bottom hook to escape control. Basically if we follow that standard operating procedure, we think, hey we had the back, let's keep the back at all costs. But really the framework should be, how can we ensure that if this person starts to escape the back, we remain in a dominant position? And again, dominant doesn't necessarily mean point scoring positions. So let's look at how we could turn their back escape into somewhat of an uncomfortable riding style position that we can still stay completely in control of. Say for example, think of it as a loop where we take someone's back but we try to remain on top. In this situation, being on top would be more important than just keeping the back for the sake of keeping the back. So let's take a look at what that would look like. So let's say I have Tyler in a seatbelt, he falls to the strangle side here. This is a super common escape. You see Tyler's trying to work this inside shoulder to the ground. And then as we're trying to keep back control here any way we can, it can prove difficult and sometimes we might have an escape where he ends up on top. Or there might be an escape where we have a scramble. Or maybe I end up on top but he's able to secure legs back in and we've gone from dominant position into a position where they have some sort of offensive chance or really they no longer feel the pressure. So let's talk about the key battles here. Tyler's key battles are beating this bottom hook. If this hook's tight, it's very difficult for him to complete the escape. And the inside shoulder. So what we actually want to do is as he starts to beat the inside shoulder, we want to take a claw grip. And as he starts to beat the bottom hook, I want to start placing my foot on top to bridge on top of Tyler here. Meaning that as he thinks he's recovering back to mount, he's actually recovering to a pin position. So we can reinforce our pin with our legs here and again that claw grip means he can't retract his right elbow. If he could retract his right elbow, he could start to be safe, we could start to do a high. We could start to use this elbow to do a high hop. And we might potentially fall off the top. So what we're doing is using the claw to prevent this elbow coming in. And we're using our right claw and in this situation I've reinforced it with my left to prevent his left knee coming to his chest. Which is of course what he would need to start building height. If I didn't have it and he brings those knees in, he turns his belly down so I can come up, he can build height and knock us off. So as he's escaping the back control, what we're seeking to do is use the claw to keep this elbow high and use our top hook to extend this. So when he's trying to tip out over the top this way, we're catching this knee and we're putting him in a torted position to make him continue to be uncomfortable. Essentially a lot of times guys will actually want to, prefer you to retake the back. So again we're in our position here, we're starting to lose the battle, it's hard to recover from this, it's not impossible. So what we want to do is take the claw and I'm using my right foot and bridging pressure here. So now Tyler, even if he wanted to go back to where we were, we've got good control over him here. And again if you look at my left foot, we can reinforce it here. So again great, great control. We can even potentially get him belly down here so I can start manipulating and hipping in right. But of course maybe we lose the claw, he brings the elbow in and he starts to escape. He turns back into us and starts to escape here. And again just thinking about returning the leg rides. And I don't want you to think I had the back, we lost the back and that's bad. I want you to think we had a position where submissions were available to us, they started to initiate an escape and we remained in control. We remained in a position where they have to use more energy and they have to take more risks than us to get back to a neutral position. And for me I'd rather have my opponent in a vulnerable, fatiguing position where I don't continue to score points than I'd rather, than to have them at their back and have a hand fighting situation where we're looking for a submission. But they're not uncomfortable, they're not stressed. So again, instead of holding onto the back for the sake of holding onto the back, we keep two hooks in, we pull them on top of us, we think hey this is the best position in Jiu Jitsu, I'm winning. I want you to think that as they start to escape that position, let's stay on top at all costs. Let's stay on top and not just stay on top, and not just stay on top in the sense of IBJF points scoring positions. Let's not go from back necessarily, it has to be the mount. I want you to think let's stay on top in such a way that there are tools to escape which would be tight elbows and that lower knee coming to their chest can't be utilized. So for a second they'll think they're winning. They're like hey, I've escaped the back, he's gone back to top position, but then they go oh, suddenly I feel like I'm in a more vulnerable, more uncomfortable position than what I was previously just escaped. All right, so let's talk about some parsing entries and we're going to begin with the leg drag entry. So obviously if I told you all the parsers in and of themselves, all the traditional parsers where we could find these positions from, we'd be here for years, right? And again, I want this instructional to supplement the game you already have. I don't want to teach you an entire new system of parsing so that you have to learn those parsers to then therefore implement this game. Everyone knows how to parse guard, most people, Tyler, but we'll start with something like the leg drag. So obviously there's a number of ways you could enter in a leg drag. Even in scrambling positions sometimes we re-enter leg drags, right? So if I had Tyler in the initial stages of a leg drag, we're basically in a scenario that is similar to what we've been working on, right? I would say this is a form of the pin control system we've been doing today because we've split the legs, we're not splitting them aggressively yet and we're applying weight over the top of them. We're trapping them in one direction. I've got weight on the lower leg, makes it hard for the foot to enter the ground. But again, and we briefly touched on this earlier, if I have Tyler here and this is a great control position, this is a position Tyler's options are limited and generally speaking he has to panic and freak out to try to escape this position. But because of the narrow framework we work in, Tyler knows from here I basically can take the back if I can lift his hips high enough or I'm looking for a pass to side control here. So in that sense, his defensive options are preventing either of those two things. And really I would say the most common one would be a situation where Tyler can begin to face me here because as I take weight off of the bottom leg, I can't keep this weight heavy to pass. So as weight comes off the bottom leg, this knee comes across the guard, comes back into play. But really, if we've got such a good control position, why not force a more aggressive angle here, right? So why not start entering our positions here, right? So I've separated the legs but arguably we want to separate this even further and one of the best ways to do that would be to allow it to fall to the ground and enter a leg split position like so, the first position we basically covered in this series here. So again, this is worse than a leg drag for Tyler, this is worse than side control for Tyler. There's even less defensive options available to him here than a typical mount position. If you put any of your training partners in this position and said, how do you escape this? No one will have a clear answer, they'll want to feel it out, experiment. Put anyone in mount and they're going to tell you three different ways to escape a mount. So we're taking that leg drag position and we're increasing the split by stretching that lower leg. If I lift my knee, Tyler's leg will fall below. And now Tyler's trying to move, we're in a complete control position here and I'm not even using my hands at this point. So however you found yourself in a leg drag, sometimes some of the easiest ways to enter a leg drag are when they overcommit from north-south and we've stacked them here. So we can work for our leg splits here, we can start setting up submissions, we can start threatening to flatten guys out. But above all, we've got a strong control position out of an ordinary traditional spot. Leg drag, if the leg drag's uncomfortable, why not keep narrowing it longer and really take advantage of the strengths of the position initially before just passing for the sake of passing. Pass number two will be basically the smash pass, super common pass and I think even that pass in and of itself fits into what we're doing here today and that is collapsing the legs, forcing your opponents to commit their weight in one direction and trapping them there. So the smash pass again is another position that I think people gloss over. They try to pass straight away, they smash the legs, they get a strong control position and because they want to score points, they can sometimes rush this position. So I would argue that why not spend a little more time there and create a more effective pin as our opponents try to recover. So for our smash pass purposes, so the explanation we have today is basically I've sprawled on Tyler in a way that concentrates his weight onto one side and really it's not necessarily the squarest angle here, I'm not facing squarely to the ground. The inside hip is going to slightly flare here to really commit Tyler's weight to this side here. So really a lot of guys will start thinking leg inside and pass immediately to side control. Sometimes obviously they start entering into dog mount territory, the force mount passes. But really this in and of itself is a pretty good control mechanism. Obviously it's limited in that you can already see Tyler's going to be able to start placing feet on the floor and if Tyler reverses his position here, this foot, my weight is here. So there's really nothing that prevents him bending and placing his toes on the ground to create movement here. So if we come back and face this way, so we're in our smash pass here and this is a loose form of the control, why not start reinforcing it? So I brought my outside foot in, now we bring our inside foot in. If we know the key to Tyler's movement is his left foot, his bottom foot and it's free to place the toes on the ground and bend, why not apply some weight to it in a way that makes it difficult for him to move that leg more? Now we've increased control but we haven't scored and this is the ultimate goal we're trying to get after here. Again, we've landed in our sort of split position here with our crab hooks here, really not leaving them many options. So again, if we're setting up our smash, again a common way would be headquarters position. His lunge is coming back on but we've sprawled here, we've got a good control mechanism. I can't keep Tyler here as long as I want. I would say basically you can assess the strength of your pin by how long you can keep him here without adjusting position. So if I just keep weight on Tyler and Tyler starts to move, you'll see I've made it difficult for him but he's able to find a way out. If I start out bragging and now Tyler starts to move, so you can see we have a better control position, well basically the same mechanism as a smash here. So if the smash is uncomfortable for your opponent, why don't we find a way to really pin them from that position. Again, smash would be one of the cornerstones of what we're doing in this product, this series here and that is if we can contort the spine and pin it, why not maximize our ability to keep them there. Dove mount, it was a position BJ Penn used extensively in his MMA career. Obviously MMA, the bottom guy's sole goal is to stand back up. So when the bottom guy would use butterfly hooks to try to create elevation, create space, BJ Penn would hip switch in the air to try to split the legs. Again, this is a form of what we're doing today but it's just not as reinforced as we would hope. But using the dove mount to get to where we want to get is a very, very strong starting position. Anything where the legs are split or the hips are committed to one side and one direction is the basic building blocks of what we're trying to do. Again I have to mention dove mount, dove mount was used extensively. There wasn't such a great threat of leg lock entries so we needed to change it slightly. We needed to adapt it to the modern game. But again, obviously it was used in the MMA context. Leg locks are very rarely used in MMA so it was a factor that guys like BJ Penn didn't have to worry about back then. So BJ would be basically floating on the hips here. He would use this because it's obviously tough for Tyler to start standing up when I'm abiding by these sort of head over head principles. He would hip switch in the air so you can see I can basically start to guide Tyler's legs. Or even if Tyler were to start extending his legs we can start switching our hips inside. He created a form of a leg split. Again, I don't want to stay here facing on this platform. While I'm on my inside hip I'm not at too much of a leg lock risk but if I start to come up here too sloppily Tyler can invert and he can start getting to a leg lock entry. So when we want to come up my inside knee is going to face his legs. Basically my entire body wants to face back this way. The more I'm in line with his spine the more leg lock risk I have. So as we switch and my knee turns back in, now if Tyler tries to invert he cannot invert because this leg here is causing, he cannot retract it quite well enough because my knee is blocking him here. If I wasn't blocking him that knee can come in and create inversions. So by us pointing our knee this direction it's eliminating the use of this leg. And the way I'm back heeling I've shelved this leg. Tyler's top leg is basically useless at this point. So you can see we've created a mild form of pin here and then we can start windshield wiping and start covering hips here. So I'll be moving it again. I'm on the legs here. Again we are in a good pin initially. Tyler's trying to move here, we've got him stuck but I need to switch my hips at a point to get some action going. But I want to switch, I want to come up, face the lower half of his body. Tyler's trying to invert. If he is actually finding inversion success I'll use my hand to try to overextend his bottom leg. The further this leg is in line with his spine the harder it is for him to invert. All of his dangerous explosive movements come from this knee being tight. So even here with a mild cross face is a good way to prevent inversions. And then we can start windshield wiping our legs to get to our base position here which is our base leg riding position. So guys I would play around with that, grab someone that's good at butterfly sweeps, that's not a leg locker and start practicing switching hips and landing in pins. And then once you've developed the confidence in that ability start finding someone that is actually good at inverting to the legs and see if you can tie it in such a way that you can shut down the leg entries. Basically punishing them for going for those leg entries. But if you want to look back, BJ Penn's earlier fights, he had a fight against Takenori Gomi and he does demonstrate some cool sort of dog mount control from there. I think BJ Penn, super innovative back then, still worth watching even to this day. Alright so let's cover some details with the body lock. Obviously power top, I covered some body lock details, nothing in great, it wasn't in great detail but it just fitted as part of a larger system. And also conceptually we can use the body lock to start covering legs here. So the end game with everything we're doing is to cover the legs and develop weight around the knees. A common response to body lock is the leg extension and our opponents trying to sit up. So we have Tyler in the body lock here, face this angle here. Even if my hands aren't connected here, but I'm sitting on Tyler's hooks and he wants to sit up, he starts to bring his foot and he starts to sit up here. Now he's in a much better offensive position to play butterfly guard. It's harder for us to pass when they're sitting up. But we can start thinking about things like I can start to leave space for him to come up and as he comes up I can turn my legs out and we can start covering the legs here. So you can see what we do, what we're always doing, we're trying to create this. And our opponents on bottom always have to in some regard give us something like this. So as I've landed and covered him, now we're in territory to start stepping over, stapling, whatever we like to do. But I'm trying to steer Tyler's knees away. So I'm leaving a bit of space, I'm briefing my knees to turn him away here. And we don't have to go too far over the knees here. We never want to rush once we've started to cover things. Tyler wants these movements to clear these positions. If I try to step over, he creates space. So we always want small movements, small stapling style movements here. I just want to keep him where he is. I want to keep the legs collapsed and split so we can use out floating body block style pressure to create these movements. And if we look at it from this angle too. As Tyler starts to extend, I turn my knees in and start to cover his hips. I'm keeping heavy on him here and we take minor movements. If I go to step over both legs, Tyler has greater ability to out balance me. So we take these baby steps here. So you saw he tried to out balance me there, but I was able to kill it with this style of pressure. So again, seeing how these things fit in and even other examples here. So say we have basically, it all revolves around body lock style system, whether your arms are open or closed. It's the same mechanisms here. So if we want to start stepping over legs, we can use our armpit here. So I don't just have to run in a circle like it's traditionally taught. I use my body weight and armpit pressure to start covering the legs. If his leg's straight here, that's great. A straight leg is the one that's difficult to utilize because we're killing the bottom hook. And then we can start stapling inside these legs here. So even here, I'm in a very strong position to prevent Tyler from out balancing me, exploding here. We can even use the open part of our secondary foot to prevent Tyler bending it completely. So we have these positions here where we can start to destabilize. Instead of kicking off to side control, we can kick off the butterfly hook and reinforce that staple here. We don't really, we're talking control again. You don't necessarily want to rush upper body. This is our control zone here. So when I'm talking about step over, I want to straighten this leg. Now Tyler's in, I have control of Tyler. I've got it here. I need to work my work to actually stop Posse because now he can put his feet on the ground. He'd start doing explosive shit. But if I'm surfing these legs here, even if he's going to butterfly, Tyler tries to move here. There's no, and you see that he starts when he bridges off, he starts giving us the claw. We can stop stepping over, surfing these legs here, staying behind the legs. So again, we even have turking style options too. So we're in our bunny loop series here. I can use my interior foot to sit on Tyler's leg. Now we've created the same pressure with a leg shelf here. We can start to turk these legs and Tyler can start to turn or leave this pressure and we can do pass ups here. You can see here Tyler trying to move. Very, very difficult here and you can see quite often a lot of these things lead to Tyler wanting to turn belly down. So again, this situation here, I'm using my inside leg to catch Tyler's Achilles and I sit on it. Now he can't lift his knee high. I can step my leg over and I'm going to be bringing my outside knee inside his knee. It basically creates knee bar style pressure that Tyler wants to relieve by turning away from me. When he turns away is when we do a pass up and now we've created a situation where the legs are split and he's trapped on this side knee. So we've got that reverse turk style pressure. Again, that's where we can start reinforcing our leg splits, always leading back to this sort of ultimate control position here. So again, we're not going into crazy detail about these techniques. The body locks have been well established for a long time now. So you're already going to have your basic methodology for creating those passes. But what I want you to try to fit in is the leg pins and staples into your preexisting body lock passes. Don't grab the body lock, pass the guard straight away. Grab the body lock to further your control and sometimes furthering your control means not committing all the way to the pass, it means staying on those legs, making them uncomfortable in those positions.
