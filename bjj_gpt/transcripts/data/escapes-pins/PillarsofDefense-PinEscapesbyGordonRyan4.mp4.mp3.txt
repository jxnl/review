 Alright, so another day, we're back. Sunny has changed her clothes. She stole some spats out of the BJJ Canucks janitor's closet. So she has new spats on now. So hopefully you guys enjoy it. Hopefully she just blended in with the mat and you have no idea where her legs are the whole time. So now we're going to go into a change in hand positions from top pins. Everything we've done so far has been primarily based around my partner having a top-patted arm, a standard underhook, and crossface. Soon your partner is going to start to realize if you're very good at playing a side guard, you're very good at bringing the knees in to face your partner, and you're very good at, if she does crowd your hips, you're very good at using tricep posts and escapes that start by facing away from them, they're going to start to realize if they switch to a double underhook position or if they change their hand position or switch to their hip position, that it's going to be much harder for you to escape. The number one thing that is going to give us an issue with this double underhooks is the fact that we have no ability now to lock a side guard because of the fact that we can't get a knee to elbow connection. So my partner has a situation where she switches from a top-hatted arm into a situation where she punches an underhook in like so. This is going to be a problem now because of the fact that now when I'm going to connect my knee and my elbow together, there's a physical wedge between them. So we're going to have to learn how to deal with this. Understand that your partner, when she has double underhooks, is not going to circle towards my hips. If she circles towards my hips, it's the easiest thing in the world, probably my hand's back to the inside position. So from here, as my partner goes into double underhooks, most of the time what she's going to be looking to do is put her head either on the far side like so or put her head on the near side like so. So now from here, I can't connect my knee and my elbow, my hand's getting elevated over my head, and she starts to go into shin mount, she starts to go into other attacks from here, and I start to get mounted and things go south. So we're going to look at escaping, bringing hands back inside when my partner has double underhooks and how we can transition and go into escapes off of that when we feel like side guard is not going to be an option. So let's look at escaping as my partner goes to unlock her hands and pommel to double underhooks. Understand that if your partner tries to make this transition with her head in the same place she had it when she was in the top head and arm, it's going to be a pretty easy thing to pommel your hand from the side. So your partner will have to make a transition when she's in the top head and arm from her head being on the far side to her head being on the near side. And if at any point your partner tries to make a switch with her head in this position and she tries to pommel a hand inside, the second she unlocks her hands, this gives me the ability, whether I have the inside or the outside elbow position, this gives me the ability to pommel a hand inside her bicep. So the second I see she goes to pommel a hand inside like so, I just go in and I lock an inside bicep tie like so. So that from here when she goes to pommel underneath my arm for double underhooks, she can't. Now when she goes to relock her hand from here, she can't do that either. And now it's a pretty easy thing to start moving out and away from my partner. Now when she goes to solidify a pin, I'm going to look to start taking everything back to the inside position. So from here I can always make space to get my left hand inside like so and take a cross shoulder post. And now from here it's a pretty easy thing to go in, connect my knee to my partner's hip and as she goes to come forward, I just kip, kip, kip and form a side guard and now we've effectively escaped. So if I see my partner goes from a top-headed arm and she doesn't change her head position and she just tries to pommel a hand inside, whether I have the outside elbow position or if I have the inside elbow position. When she goes to pommel to that double underhook, it's the easiest thing in the world to go in and lock with a inside bicep tie. If you feel like your partner is so uber strong that this inside bicep tie isn't going to be enough and maybe you're half the size of your partner and she's just going to strengthen her way into a situation where she can go in and relock her hands, relock her hands and crush that inside bicep tie. If I ever see this, I just go in and I physically lock my hands. All right. So now when she goes to relock her hands, this is not going to happen from here. Okay. This is one of the few times where it's permissible for me to lock over my partner and start locking my hands like so. Okay. Most of the time, this inside bicep tie will be enough for you to start moving and give you time to get your limbs back inside. But if I have someone who's just so much stronger than me that my frames are going to get crushed back in towards my head, whenever I see this, we just go in and lock a 10-finger grip like so. Okay. So I've relocked. Now I start my game where I pommel a knee to the inside. And now from here, we can separate our partner's arms, go in, bring everything back to the inside position and go into a recovery. Okay. So if your partner tries to transition to a double underhook scenario and she doesn't move her head position, you're going to be able to easily pommel to an inside bicep tie. Now where you're going to get beat is when my partner first makes a transition where her head moves to the opposite side. So most of the time, she'll take a cross-face hand out. And as she posts on my ear, she will shove my head across, switch her head to the opposite side. And now when she gets to pommel in for double underhooks, it's a hard thing for me to beat her from here. And now this is where I usually get caught and I get my arms elevated up and over my head. Okay. So now you guys, your partner's head position as she goes to make the pommel. If she doesn't move her head position, move to an inside bicep tie and bring everything back in and recover as she's making the transition, as she's moving. But if she does switch the head and she goes to pommel underhook in, you're going to have a hard time recovering. And then you have to work from a true double underhook scenario. All right. So let's look at now my partner has double underhooks and we are looking to pommel back inside. Now understand this is one of the worst pins that you can be in, in terms of escaping. If your partner switches the head and has good position with the head, good position with the arms, it's very likely that you're going to get mounted. You should be getting mounted from here. This is a far better position than a top-headed arm. So understand that there is an end game here. We'll look at that in a second. Now my partner can have one of two positions with her hands. She can have unlocked hands where she cups my shoulders like so, and she can have locked hands where she starts locking her hands and elevating my arms up high and over my shoulders. Okay. There's advantages and disadvantages to both of these. The advantage to unlocked hands when she cups my shoulders is that from here, I can't shoulder walk backwards and disrupt the grip. The disadvantage for her is that from here, I can bring my elbows down much easier. Okay. The advantage for her having double underhooks with locked hands is that from here, I can't just physically pull my elbows down. But what I can do is I can start to shoulder walk and disrupt my partner's grip. What will happen is, if my back will end up on top of my partner's hands, and as I shoulder walk, it will disrupt the grip and separate her hands. Okay. So there's advantages and disadvantages to both, and your partner can play with these back and forth. Okay. Now, assuming my partner has double underhooks with her head on the opposite side, like so, if she has unlocked hands, what we're going to be looking to do is looking to free our right elbow. So from here, what I'm going to look to start doing is I'm going to look to pummel my hand to the inside, like so. As I pummel my hand to the inside position, I'm looking to start freeing my right elbow. Now, I can't lock a side guard. My partner knows this. So I have to make sure that I at least bring my knee to my partner's hip. If I don't do this, there's no reason she doesn't move right into a shin mount and a musley mount. Okay. So from this position, I'm going to look to start moving out and away and bringing my knee to my partner's hip. From here, I'm going to give a strong bridge and I'm going to put a V-grip in my partner's far shoulder. Everything is going to go out and over my right shoulder. And then from here, I'm going to look to start limping my right arm free. So I straighten my right arm. So I give a strong bridge off my left foot. I keep my right knee in place. As I do this, I give a strong bridge and I just look to extend my left arm like so, and then I push and I just limp the right elbow inside of my partner's shoulder. So when she goes to hold on tight, I give a strong bridge out and over the right shoulder and I just relax my right arm and I limp it just inside my partner's left shoulder like so. And now from here, we bring the hand inside. If possible, I take that left elbow inside as well. You won't always be able to do that, but if you can, it's a good option. But now I can bring my knees inside, I can punch the underhooks, I can do a variety of different things from here. So assuming my partner has unlocked hands and her head is in the far shoulder, we pummel our left hand to the inside position and we put our knee on our partner's hip. Now if she goes to lock up tight, I look to start bridging over my right shoulder. As I do this, I initially clamp down on my partner's elbow. What this will do is it will force my partner to open the elbow and give me an overreaction to make it easier to bring my elbow inside. So I clamp down like I'm looking to try to take her over my right shoulder. As she goes to adjust and she opens the elbow, I slide that elbow to the inside and from here we fight everything back to the inside position. Okay, so that's number one. Number two is she has double underhooks and this time she has locked hands up high like so and her head is still over my far shoulder from here. From this position, I just take my two thumbs and I turn them down towards the ceiling as I start to bridge and I just shoulder walk and shimmy over my partner's arms to unlock her hands. The whole time I can't just bridge. If I just bridge and you're going to do this, she just steps over into mount. But from here I have to keep my knee in. So if my partner does go to step over into mount, she gets disrupted a little bit by my right knee so I can maybe snaggle my butterfly hooks back into place and recover from there. From here I keep my right knee up, I take my left foot in and I start bridging and walking and shimmying so I separate my partner's hands like so. Now from here, left hand comes in once again. She goes to hold on tight. We take that right elbow back inside and from here we're ready to go. So if my partner has locked hands, I have to separate the hands first by shoulder walking, move and convert to an unlocked hands when she's cupping the shoulders and then fight everything back to the inside position. Now if your partner is talented at all and she has locked or unlocked hands with proper head position, where her head's on this side, this is your endgame from here. I don't really have viable escaping options from this position and it's for one simple reason because of the fact that there's not going to be enough time for you to free your hands and get everything back to the inside position before she just puts her shin across my belly. I can bridge, I can do all these kinds of things but if there's a race from here, it's going to be the race for her to get her shin across your belly and once she does that, you're pretty much mounted. So my whole thing is to try to get my hands back inside but as I go to do that and we go to race, she's just going to bring her shin to my belly. So I'm going to say 1, 2, 3, I'm going to try to bridge and free my arms and she's just going to try to go into a mounted position and it's going to be very clear who's going to win this battle. 1, 2, 3. There's no way. I can give a strong bridge, I can give a strong bridge over my shoulder, it's just very limited what I can do here. Even though I'm much bigger and stronger, 1, 2, 3, there's just, go back, you can go the opposite way, 1, 2, 3. It's very difficult to do anything from here. If we switch positions, the reason why this is so strong is because your partner can't get any of her hands to the inside position. When she goes to pummel her hands in in any capacity, she can't do it. When she goes to bring knee to elbow connection, she can't do it. When she goes to take her knee inside, she can't do it. When she goes to stop me from putting my shin up and across her shin or her hips, she can't do it. There's just no inside position that my partner can fight to in a time allotted in order to get a full recovery up. So in the event that your partner has double underhooks with poor or mediocre head position, it's a pretty easy thing to pummel hands back inside. Or if she circles towards her hips, for example, like if she has double underhooks and she doesn't realize that if she circles towards the hips, now she can't crowd the head and it's easy to pummel my hands back to the inside and start to work from here. But if your partner's talented and she has double underhooks with her head glued to the floor on the near side, there's just no possible way that I could fight to any kind of relevant inside position in the time allotted before my partner takes her shin, beats my knee, and slides it across like so. And there are things that we can do as she goes to mount where we can escape possibly, but it's going to be tough from there. We'll look at those later, but it's going to be tough from there. So the end game, for me at least, is when my partner has double underhooks with the head on the near side, good head position, dominates all the inside position, and you can't get a knee inside, you can't get an elbow inside, you can't get a hand inside, that's when you should be losing this game. So now, another great way that my partner can stop me from playing a side guard is they can put in double underhooks, they can crowd my hips. Another great way, another great option that your partner might start resorting to is by switching their hips. So they can change your hand position, but they can also change your hip and leg position. So whenever I see that from this position, my partner feels that I'm going to start inserting a side guard, and from here she switches the hips. So she sits her hips down, either to the floor or near to the floor, so that now from here, when I go to insert my knee, I physically can't because of the fact that there's no exposure of the hip, and my partner completely shut down my ability to play a side guard from here. So now, she can switch her hips with a variety of different grips. She can sit through like this with a crossface and an underhook, she can take this hand through, and she can move to a situation like so, where she starts lifting my arm and she starts going into your generic kese tatame hip switches and things like that, and we'll look at those as we progress. But understand the game that we're playing here. My partner hip switches, it's going to make it incredibly difficult for me to immediately insert a knee. But what it'll make it much easier for me to do is to insert my hands. So normally when she has squared hips, she can drive her chin over my far shoulder and make a strong connection, chin to trap and her ear to her shoulder. So she can give me a very tough time inserting this left hand, she can give me a very tough time sometimes inserting this right elbow. When she switches her hips, she naturally won't be as tight to my upper body. So from here, when she goes to switch her hips, she goes to drive forward towards my far shoulder, she can give me some problems, but it's going to be much easier from here to start moving my partner around and go in and then rock my partner and insert hands to the inside. So while it'll be much harder to insert my knees into a side guard position, it'll be much easier to insert my hands into some kind of upper body framing positions. And we're going to use that to start off-balancing my partner and use misdirections to eventually go in and start recovering. All right, so let's take a look at those now. Let's look at inserting our hands properly as our partner switches the hips. How can I do this so you can see? We're going to have a partner who sits the hips through and we're going to look to start inserting our frame to the inside. Okay. What I don't want is for my right elbow to be shelved on my partner's outside hip. Okay. So the second my partner goes to sit through, if I have the inside elbow position and she goes to sit through, I just pull my elbow to the floor. So now when she goes to sit through, she misses the elbow and she slides through and I have the inside elbow position. If I feel that my elbow gets caught on my partner's hip when she goes to sit through, I'm going to start looking to play a game where at first I'm going to pummel my left hand to the inside position. So she has her hand in good position. From here, I'm just going to go through and I'm just going to insert my hand inside. Okay. This is a pretty easy thing to do because of the fact that your partner has the hips on the floor and she can't crowd my head like she could before. So I play a game where I just move my hips around. I give small bridges and bumps and I get my hand inside like so. Now from this position, she goes to sit through and she goes to trap my elbow up like so. From here, what I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to use a pendulum method. Right now, she's sitting through so I can't insert my knee, but my hips are free to move because of the fact that she's not controlling my hips. Everything is focused on controlling my head and shoulders from here. So from here, I take my legs out to my left and I pendulum to my right. Out to my left, I pendulum to my right. And once I have momentum built, from here I just use a concave shoulder effect to look to give a slight push with my left hand on the shoulder and I just limp my right elbow out and down to the floor like so. From this position, I have the inside elbow and now I have a knee and hip connection. If at any point she squares her hips, she goes right onto a side guard. So now she's more or less stuck in this position. Unless from here, she first walks back towards my hips, crowds them, points my knees away. Now she can square back up. But if she goes right in from here, she goes to square the hips without pointing my knees away from her, she's going to move onto a side guard. So now I have my elbow inside my partner's hip like so. I have frames inside my partner's shoulder and now I have a knee connected to my partner's hip. And now we can start to work from here. So I see my partner sit through. Initially, I want an inside elbow so when she goes to sit through, she moves past my elbow and sets her hip down to the floor. This time, I feel like my elbow gets trapped. So the first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to palm of my left hand to the inside position. So that's a pretty easy thing to do, getting our hand inside. Now she goes to start controlling my arm nice and tight. It's a hard thing from here to just try to pull my arm out. She goes to walk towards my hips and she goes to cover. I can't pull my arm out from here. So from here, I use momentum. When she goes to lock up tight with tension and she goes to keep my arm trapped, it's a pretty easy thing to blade my shoulders and pull the elbow through. And now from here, I move to this position like so. So now if at any point my knees point towards her and she squares the hips, she comes right into a side guard every time. And now she left to keep her hips switched and now we can go into all of our escapes with proper frames in place. All right, so let's look at our first escape. This one is not going to be for everyone, but it doesn't require as much flexibility as you think it might. It's all more about the angle of the hips and its dexterity of the legs. So we're going to look at a situation where we have the inside position of my partner switches the hips and we get to a scenario like so. Now from here, if your hips are close to your partner's and you try to throw your leg over your partner's face, you're going to find that it's going to be incredibly difficult to do unless you're extremely flexible. I'm relatively flexible and I don't have the dexterity to do that. So from here, the first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to walk away from my partner so that our bodies form this perpendicular angle like so. Now if your partner stays in this position, then it's going to be easy to create an angle. Normally what's going to happen is as you go to walk away, your partner will circle with you and she'll follow you. So normally as I go to do this move, realistically, I'm going to use a pendulum out in this direction to move my hips out into this position and then immediately just flick my leg over my partner's head. Because I have the inside position with my left elbow, it's a pretty easy thing to expose my partner's head to that high-legging position here. So from here, she goes to keep everything locked up tight. As I go to throw my leg up and over, I'm going to look to start pushing my partner's head up and away and I'm going to look to start taking my partner's cross face out and over and slipping it off my head. As I expose my partner's head to the high leg, I just concave my shoulders and we move into a situation where it makes it easy for us to throw a leg up and over our partner's face like so. Now when she goes to keep her hands locked, there's no way. I just extend my leg and from here we take our leg off. Now we scissor our legs and as our partner goes to beat us up to top position, we just punch in a far side underhook, we punch in a cross face, we scissor our legs, we move to top position and solidify a top pin. So this is not going to be for everyone, but it's more about the angle of your hips than it is the flexibility of your legs and hips. If my hips are connected to my partner and I try to do this, you're never going to have any success. My whole thing is I walk this perpendicular angle like so. Realistically, my partner will try to be hip to hip. So I'll have to use a pendulum to take my leg up and over. She goes to hide the face from the high leg. It's a pretty difficult thing to do. And from here, I just take my legs into a swisher position and as we both go to get up, I scissor my legs, we move into a top head and arm and we reverse the position completely. So we're going to pendulum our hips out and away from our partner and our goal is to create the largest disconnection of my hips and my partner's so I can create an angle where I can easily throw my leg up and over my partner's face. If you are totally inflexible, you won't be able to do this, but it doesn't require that much flexibility. If you look at what I'm actually asking you to do, I'm only asking you to bring your leg up to about here. And you do this when you're playing guard every single day. This is no different. Even if she's trying to stay tight, she keeps her hands locked tight. I'm only asking you, let go, I'm only asking you to bring your leg up to here. Everybody can do this. Okay, so pretty good, pretty good option as far as escaping. Now let's look at some ways that we can play with a game where if you can't throw the leg over the face, whatever the case is, you can't expose your partner's head, you absolutely just cannot get the leg over the face. How can we play a pendulum game to start sitting a partner up and then locking side guard and facing a partner and making them change position to get back to the inside position. All right, so let's talk about now going into other escapes where we can use a pendulum to sit our partner up and we use a threat of sweeping our partner forwards and then locking a side guard. So understand that in the previous series we looked at things where we start bridging our partner forward when she had square hips. So she had square hips and she was chasing my head and crowding my head and from here I can start playing a game where I bump my partner forward and I start bringing everything up and over my shoulder. In this case where she has her hips switched like so, now when I go to bump my partner forward towards my head, she can just lean back towards my hips. So you're counterproductive trying to take your partner forward. All she has to do is start leaning backwards in this direction and now from here nothing forward will ever be able to off balance her. No motion forward will off balance her. So from this position I play a simple game where I threaten a pendulum. So from here I'm going to walk my hips out and away as far as I can and from here I'm just going to take my leg straight up towards my partner's head and then I'm just going to rock with a concave shoulder position and take my partner forward. What you're trying to do is essentially form, move that away, you're trying to form the shape of a rocking chair with your shoulders in spot. So that from here I can sit my partner forward, I can very easily rock forwards and backwards. What this will do is it will create a dilemma for your partner. If she stays with the same hip position and she stays and she goes to lock up tight, with this pendulum forward, then you move to the switcher position, you both get to get up, you scissor your legs and now you solidify the top hip. So if she stays in this position, I have everything in sight, she switches her hips, if she stays in this position I just move out and away, I pendulum up and now as we both get to the top position you always win that battle and you usually have your partner's arm isolated on your hip as you come up. So what inevitably everyone's going to do when they feel they're off balanced is they're going to re-square the hips. So I pendulum, either I walk away or if my partner's chasing my hips I just pendulum away and then I go. My partner re-squares the hips. Now remember what we said before, if at any point my partner re-squares the hips without first pointing my knees away from her, she's always going to come right onto a side guard. And because of the fact that we're off balancing with the pendulum, my partner has no time to walk towards my hips and force my knees to point away from her, which means that she's in a dilemma now. If she stays with her hips staggered and she switches the hips towards me, she'll always fall over and end up in bottom side control and she'll be in a top pit. So there's no choice but to square the hips. And as she squares the hips, she moves right onto a side guard. Now she has her hands locked presumably and from here we take everything back to the inside position, we separate our partner's hands and we go right back into our previous series for the escape. So whenever I see my partner switches the hips towards me, she's a top-headed arm. From here I threaten the pendulum, if nothing happens she falls over. So from here as I go up, I go to take her over, she squares the hips. The second I see this, she has no time to point my knees away from her. She has to square the hips in order to not get taken over. And from here as she goes to follow me, we just connect, knee and elbow like so. From here we come in, we take everything to the inside position, we lock up, we separate our partner's hands and then we go into any of our re-guards or counter-offense right from there. So we play this crucial, crucial dilemma where we create a disconnection in the hips and we threaten sitting our partner forward. You can never take your partner up and over your head because of the fact that she's leaning back towards your hips. But she has no base directly behind her. So you pendulum up, if she stays in this same hip position, she falls over into bottom side control. So she has to re-square the hips and she immediately comes right onto a side guard, you connect knee and elbow and then you're scot-free and you're out. Let's look at Keisuke Tame now. This is a pretty relevant move in Judo and it was made famous in Jiu-Jitsu by Josh Burnett submitting Dean Lister from here. It's pretty similar as far as escapes go, but the hand position is a little different. So that means that when your partner actually locks the position up, if you can free your bottom elbow, it's a pretty easy thing to start creating some kind of back exposure for your partner because she has no false head under hook and she's turning her back to you. So at any point, she switches to a position where she has just control over my head and she loses control over my bottom elbow and she locks her hands. It's a pretty easy thing for me to start bumping her forwards and starting to create some kind of back exposure where the cross face flips off and now we can go in and start tracking my partner's back. That being said, if your partner does actually trap your elbow like so, it's much harder to free this elbow because of a simple fact that my partner now has a hand assist. When she switches to the previous hand position with a top head and arm, now your partner's busy cross facing you with a near side arm. So she has no ability to control this elbow, which makes it a pretty easy thing where as she goes to lock up tension, I just go in, I pendulum and I can free the bottom elbow. This time she has just control over my head. So assuming I can free the bottom elbow, there's a little bit more back exposure than there was previously because of the lack of the false head under hook. Now, in order to free that elbow can be a big issue from here. When she goes to start going in and going in as using an over hook in that elbow, now when I get to use that same motion to free my elbow, she actually has a physical grip on my arm. So she has a free hand now to monitor my elbow so she can keep it elevated on her hips and not allow me to take the elbow down to the floor where I want it. All right, so we're going to have to adjust and go into some very different forms of escape from here, freeing the elbow, attacking our partner's back and using pendulums to start sitting our partner down and threatening, taking our partner over to then recover guard. All right, so let's look at someone who switches the hips and they go to move from a top headed arm to this Keisuke Tame grip. The first thing I'm looking to do is to always free my inside elbow and bring my elbow to the floor as I go to hit the grip change. Once they actually switch the grips and have a grip on my arm and elevated on the hip, then you start to run into problems. So one of the best times to escape is as they're going to make the grip change. If you have a top headed arm, she sits her hips through and what I want is to immediately bring my elbow to the inside. This is usually a pretty easy thing to do as soon as my partner goes to switch to grips or goes to sit her hips through because of the fact that she has no control over this near arm, she has no control of my hips and it's a pretty easy thing to immediately take my elbow to the inside position. If I feel my elbow is caught on the outside and she goes to make the grip change, as she goes to make the grip change, I'm going to immediately, as she's going to make the grip change, before she gets a hold of my elbow, I pull my elbow down to the floor. It's crucial you get this elbow down to the floor. If your partner elevates the elbow on top of the hip, now it's going to be difficult to start moving anywhere from here. You're playing more of a long game in terms of escape. I can make this a quick transition where as my partner goes to switch, we use this inside elbow like so and now we just take our top leg to our partner's buttocks and we take our hand to a thigh pry on my partner's far thigh like so. Now from here, we just bump our partner forward and we use the thigh pry, the straightening of the arm, and we use our left shoulder to just put our partner's right hand on the floor like so. Now from here, wherever she chooses to go, I have weight over the hand. It's the easiest thing in the world now to just duck my head and put my ear on her back. And now, wherever she chooses to go, usually she'll turn away from me, we get up, and we get to eternal position. If she turns into me, now she turns into a top pin, we move into a top side control type scenario. So whenever I see my partner goes to hit a quick grip change, or she switches to hips, the battle is always going to be fought at the near elbow. If she can relinquish the underhook and take a cross face and control my elbow, now I'm stuck. I'm pinned for at least five, 10 seconds, if not more. But if she goes to make this grip change, and as she does, I slide the elbow in, she goes to control my head. From here, it's the easiest thing in the world now. As she goes to start controlling me, put the hand on the floor, take the head out, put my ear on my partner's back, and then start to go into all of our favorite follow-ups with back attacks or top pins. All right, so the easiest way, again, is to escape the intermediary steps between positions. As she takes one grip out and goes to transition to another grip, that's when we go into our easiest escapes. All right, let's look at some escapes from this position. First of all, let's just look at how to not get submitted, all right? Because if you're six, eight, 10 minutes, 15, 20, 30 minutes into a match, and someone starts to put pressure on you from here, you can actually get asphyxiated, and you can be submitted from here. And there's a very easy fix, and once you see this, you're going to be like, oh my God, I can't believe. If you got submitted in this move before, you're going to be like, I can't believe I didn't know this. So whenever I see my partner is switching to this keshi katame, and she's leaning back and crunching my chin to my chest, bringing everything forward like so. Whenever I see this, and I feel like there's pressure on me, usually the hands are locked, and she's exactly, she's putting pressure on me, and she's much bigger than me. Whenever I see this, understand that in order for her to submit me and put pressure on me, she has to lean back and away from me. So this is the whole idea of the move. And it makes it hard for you to start creating an angle with your shoulders and taking your back and using this underhook effectively. So the second I see this, I just take my foot in towards my butt like so, and I just place a wedge on the top of my own thigh. And now I place a second wedge on top of her own back. When she goes to start leaning back and putting pressure on me, there's no extension. Here if she locks up super tight, and she takes her hips off the floor, and she starts to lean back, you can see here the change in my voice as there's pressure on my torso. I take my knee to my partner's back, and now as she goes to apply the same pressure, you see that there's not nearly enough extension to start putting pressure on me to a point where there's pressure strong enough to submit me. So whenever I see my partner's putting a good amount of pressure on me, I just take a wedge on my own leg. I place a wedge behind her back, and now she goes to finish the asphyxiation. There's just no way she can extend, and we can at least be safe from here, and we can hang out for a minute at a time, instead of freaking out and trying to have 30 seconds before you get submitted. Now what I'm looking to do is if I can free my partner's elbow, if I can free my elbow, I'm looking to free my elbow and start taking my partner's back. So for example, if my partner cups my elbow with her hand, and from here she has an elbow that is exposed, let's say she takes her elbow too far back, and I can expose the space between my partner's elbow and her ribcage, and I can take a one-on-one grip here. Now from here I can use this to strip the grip, and I can use that same pendulum motion to free my elbow and start the previous escapes. More than likely, my partner is going to have a strong elbow-to-elbow connection like so, and she's going to have a deep tricep grip, so when I go to do that, it's going to be a difficult thing to do. Or she's going to have locked hands like so, or some people even take an underhook on this near side arm, and they lock their hands like this, and they start putting pressure on you. Understand that the entire, mechanically, her entire goal from this position is to put enough pressure, crunching my chin to chest, to keep my shoulders square so that I can't angle my shoulders out and exploit this underhook. If my shoulders start to angle out, and I start to free this elbow, I use this underhook, and I start going in and taking her back. So her whole thing from here is to put pressure on me, and keeping me pinned by leaning back in this direction, like so. This means that there will now be more exposure to a pendulum and more exposure to a high leg. So whether my hand's here, whether my hand's here, it doesn't really make a difference. I can always take my left hand to a cross-shoulder post like so. And now, as she goes to lean back, if she doesn't lean back, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start angling my shoulder out and start creating motion. So she's going to be leaning back to a certain degree to keep me pinned. As she does that, I just walk my hips out and away, I pendulum up and over, and I expose my partner's face to that high leg. We're now from here, we come up, and we move to top position. If I see, as I got a pendulum up, my partner re-squares her hips, I'm always looking, even if my elbow is elevated on my partner's hip, you still have the inside position. Because if she squares her hips from here, I still have my elbow inside of her hip. Right now, because her hips are switched, my elbow is trapped and it's shelved on her top hip. But when she goes to square her hips, my elbow is actually inside of her hips where it should be. So here, what I want is my elbow inside of her bottom hip. But now, when she goes to square, all I need is my elbow inside of her top hip, which is where it already was. So I play a pendulum game, where even if my elbow's isolated, whether she has a grip, maybe she's holding on my elbow, I can't free the elbow, I just play a game where I either walk away or I pendulum away, and I pendulum up, and I try to take my partner up and over. Now she squares the hips, and she moves right back onto a side guard, where now from here, she usually pulls the elbow inside, we bring everything back to the inside position, and we're ready to go with all of our recoveries from here. So we play a game that's based around misdirection. My partner from here, if she has her hips on the floor and she has no tension pulling my chin into my chest, it's a pretty easy thing to start angling out and moving into positions like this, where now I can start bumping her forward, as she goes to lean back, I can expose her elbow, I can strip grips, I can pull the elbow inside, and I start to go into escapes from here. So her whole thing is to keep my shoulders pinned flat on the floor, put pressure on me by crunching my chin to my chest, like so. So from here, yes I'm more pinned than I was before, but I also have a greater ability to start off-balancing my partner straight back. By angling out, using a pendulum method to either take her over, or as she goes to square, I insert a side guard and we go in for the win. At the bare minimum, if you feel like your partner is going to submit you, maybe she's got her hands underneath, she's locked her hands, she's got a wrist to wrist grip, and she's putting so much pressure on you, or you're bridging and you're trying, and you feel like you're going to get submitted, whenever I see this, I just wedge my partner back in place. So now when she has to put pressure on me to finish me, you can see she can try as hard as she wants, and my voice hardly changed, there's not nearly enough pressure to go into a submission from there, so at least you're safe and you have minutes at a time to work instead of seconds at a time to work. Now we're going to move into other less common upper body grips that your partner could have on you, and how to address them properly. One of them is a body lock, where your partner just passes your guard, they have a body lock, they have no control of your head and shoulders, how can we escape? First and foremost, the easiest way to escape a body lock is just to wait for your partner to unlock their hands. If you have the time to do this, this is always going to be the most cost efficient way to regard as your partner unlocks the hands. If you have to escape as your partner has their hands locked, you can do it, but it's going to cost you a lot more, it's going to be a lot more energy consuming to do it this way. So the best way, number one, to escape if my partner has locked hands in a body lock, has control over my hips, is I just simply wait for this position. As my partner, right now, yes, she's passed my legs, she's technically passed my guard, she would score if it was under a points rule set, but she has no way to actually progress into a submission from here until she has control over my head and shoulders. So the second I see my partner has locked hands, I immediately, I'm going to take the inside position by going into a cross shoulder post like so, and making sure that my elbow stays inside my partner's elbow and shoulder on this side. But I don't want her to have a cross shoulder post, and if she puts an underhook in, and a cross face in, and she moves up, my elbow gets caught outside my partner's elbow, and now she's the inside position. So I'm very disciplined with my elbow position. I move to a cross shoulder post here, and I immediately move to an angle where my elbow comes inside my partner's shoulder like so. And now from here, I take my second hand and I bring it inside my partner's shoulder. So I go to a cross shoulder post like so, I take my elbow inside my partner's shoulder, and I create an angle where I blade my shoulders. Now I take my right elbow, I bring it inside my partner's shoulder like so. And now I just wait. It can be hard for you to extend and push your partner's hands apart. So I just wait in this position. When my partner goes to make a cranial shift and moves my upper body to control my head and shoulders, you dominate all the inside position, and it's the easiest thing in the world to take everything back inside. So I play a waiting game where she has a body lock, I take a cross shoulder post, and I get my elbow well inside the shoulder. I take my second elbow well inside the shoulder, and I just play a waiting game here. When she has to move around and switch to the head and the arm, we can just bring that side guard back into place and connect knees and elbows. Now assuming that for whatever reason, you just want to get out of the position as fast as you can. Okay, this is a little bit harder. So she has a body lock, she's locked in like so. And from here, I just want to escape the position. The first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to take two hands to my partner's shoulders like so. And now I'm going to look to start bridging up into my right shoulder, and I'm going to extend my arms straight out and away, like so. Now I'm going to tuck my right elbow underneath me. And I don't push my partner, I don't bench press my partner away from me. The wedge of my partner's shoulder is just to keep her in this position, so she can't come forward into me. Now you're probably asking, why don't we use a cross shoulder post? Because I don't have enough range with the cross shoulder post. I need more extension than a cross shoulder post can offer me. So I use a straight shoulder post like so, so I can fully extend my arm. And now from here, I just move into a situation where my hips come off the floor. And now as I push my partner's shoulders away, so she can't come towards me, I just shoot my hips past my partner's elbows. And from here, we go in and we bring the hips free. Now that was me doing a drilling. When your partner's trying to hold you, it takes a lot more energy than that. You can push and you can start shrimping, and it may take you a few tries, maybe you have to kip a little bit, but that's the idea. It's to come into a situation where I can push my partner away, and as I come up, her upper body can't move towards me. I can move the hips away, and then I can create some disconnection between her hands and her chest. And that allows me to give me just enough space to shoot the hips straight back and through that hole. Whenever I see I just need to get out of the position. Maybe I'm low on time, maybe my partner's past, I don't want to be scored on, whatever the case is. She's got a body lock locked up. I initially take two hands and I just place them here on my partner's shoulder. Now if at any point my partner goes to make a transition to any upper body contact and she tries to go chest to chest and make a cranial shift, the second I see this, I immediately take my hand back to that same position we were in before, or we can go to the inside. I don't stay with the shoulder post where she can come inside my hands exactly and beat me. So you have to be able to recognize what your partner's doing. If the hands are locked, I can go into a straight shoulder post like so. The second the hands unlock, we take our hands and elbows to the inside. So just keep that in mind as you're going through this. Now I want to go into a quick escape. I take two posts on my partner's shoulder. I extend and I push and I bridge like so, and I take my right hand off and I tuck my elbow underneath me. She goes to lock up tight, I push my partner like so, and then I quickly shoot my hips back and away. So I have an elbow wedge underneath me. I have my elbow connected to her elbow so her hands can't ride up my body. Now as she gets to follow me, I slide the hips out and through, and now we're ready to rebuke. When she goes to lock on tight, this can be a pretty difficult thing. It'll be somewhere, it'll look something like this. And you eventually can wiggle your way through and create just enough space to pull the hips free so your hips move beyond your partner's elbows. Like I said, this is going to take a lot more, you're going to exert a lot more energy trying to do this. The easiest way is just to wait for your partner to try to make a cranial shift and as they unlock, break everything inside. But here's two great ways to escape a body lock. One is a time-based method, and one is if, okay, maybe there's 30 seconds left, I'm down on points, I need a submission, I gotta get out, how can I escape quickly and go right back into offense? All right, so another position that is used, but less commonly, is a tight waist and a cross face. Now there are some distinct advantages and disadvantages for the top player when talking about this position. One of the distinct advantages is the fact that your partner has direct control over your hips, which means that there's no ability for you for it to scoot your hips away and insert a side guard. You can't move your hips. So when I'm on top and I have a strong cross face and a deep tight waist, when she tries to scoot her hips away and lock a side guard or move her hips in any fashion, there's just no way she's going to move anywhere. So this is the great advantage of using a tight waist and a cross face. Again, with a very talented side guard player who's good at pointing the knees towards you, inserting the knees, the tight waist will stop her, will stop her from doing so. When I work with a traditional head and arm, my elbow is moved up towards my partner's shoulder line, which means it gives me less control over my partner's hips. So now that she has to move her hips freely, it's a lot easier for her to do so. So that's one of the big advantages of a tight waist. Now one of the big disadvantages of a tight waist is that you have more control over your partner's hips, but less control of your partner's head and shoulders because of the fact that your hands are unlocked. So that means it can be much harder for her to lock a side guard and move the hips around, but much easier for her to start pummeling hands inside and disrupting my cross face because of the fact that my hands are no longer connected and she can easily start to clear cross faces and fight the upper body back to inside position and then eventually fight the lower body to inside position. That is a specific way to do this. So we're going to switch positions. She's going to be on top. She has a deep tight waist like so and a cross face. Now the big mistake everyone tries to make is they try to shrimp away from their partner. If she just pulls her knee to her elbow, there's no way I'm ever going to be able to deal with this effectively. So from here, the first thing I look to do is I look to start taking my right elbow to the inside or taking my left hand to the inside, which will be pretty easy and taking my right elbow to the inside. So I fight my frames to the inside position. Now from here, my whole thing is to take my hand to the inside and physically touch my own face with the backhand frame like so. Okay. It's going to be very hard for you to start clearing a cross face by bringing your partner up like so or moving towards your partner. One great advantage she has is she can control your hips so you can't angle your hips out and then when she opens up her left elbow, it elongates my body in the opposite direction I'm looking to go. So I can start to get contorted here where now the cross face is super tight and my hips are pointed the wrong way. Everything's, I'm all out of alignment here. So whenever I see this, we just take our right hand inside. It's a pretty easy thing to do because my partner's hands are unlocked. She can lock a tight cross face. It doesn't really make a difference. I can always take my hand inside and physically touch my own face like so. Now one thing I can't do is I can't move my hips away from my partner. But one thing I can do is I can move my hips towards my partner. So from here, she's pulling the hips in. I just angle my hips towards her and I look to start walking my hand up my own head like so with the backhand frame. When she gets to keep a strong cross face, I just walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, and I flare my elbow up like so. Now you have two excellent choices. One is I take a hand to my partner's tricep and from here we go right into a tricep post where we immediately look to start sitting up. A lot of times my partner's hand will actually get caught for too long underneath your body and you'll be able to just roll your partner up and over. Assuming it doesn't happen and your partner rips the hand out, we just sit all the way up to a tricep post and we go right back into our previous escape series from here. Okay. So one great option is by turning away from your partner. So I take my hand inside like so and I start turning away from my partner and angling my hips out towards my partner. She goes to keep a strong cross face and I just walk cross face off. From this position we move to a tricep post and now we go into our previous series. Now this time I clear my partner's cross face. She feels it coming off and she doesn't allow it to slip all the way past my head. What happens is she clears the, I clear the cross face and she keeps her hand that she just pulls it back to her hip or back to her hip. So now I can't tricep post in the opposite direction. Whenever I see this, I move towards my partner and I take an inside bicep tie and a cross shoulder post like so. Now from this position I have to start moving out and away from my partner, but I can't do that because of the tight waist grip. So I have to loosen the tight waist grip. The only way that I can loosen the tight waist grip is by taking my hips off the ground. Okay. So I have to find a way to take my hips off of the ground and to stop my partner from reestablishing a cross face as I do so. The problem is if I take my hips off the floor, the only way I can do so is by bridging onto my right shoulder like so. But now when I bridge onto my right shoulder, that requires my right elbow to be on the floor. If I bridge onto the point of my right shoulder, my right elbow has to come underneath my body. So that means that my right hand is occupied. When I'm trying to block my partner's cross face with this inside bicep tie, I need a mobile arm to follow the cross face as she tries to pommel. If my hand is underneath my body, she can just pommel beyond my fingers and cross face me. So the problem comes in right there. If I try to shrimp away, she pulls the elbow to the knee and I can't move my hips. If from here I try to start bridging into my partner and moving out and away, now she just takes her arm beyond where my hand can reach and she cross faces me and she flattens me back out. All right, so you're asking what the hell do I do from here? I start moving into a situation where I take my cross shoulder post and I convert it to a far wrist like so. Either a far wrist or a far elbow. Both are good. If your partner is very good at pommeling the hands and I feel like I can't control it for any amount of time, I go to the far elbow. Now my partner goes to cross face me, the cross post will stop that. And now I have the ability to get off my hips and onto the point of my shoulder. When she goes to put a tight waist in, we loosen the tight waist by moving my hips up and out like so. And now from here, I just walk my hips away. When she goes to follow and use that tight waist effectively, the tight waist has no bite. And now from here, we can bring everything back inside and we've successfully recovered in some form of open guard. So from here, she has a strong tight waist and strong cross face. I start turning away from my partner and I slip the cross face up. If the hand comes all the way through, we go to a tricep post series. If the hand comes back to the hip, we take everything inside. Now the problem is if I stay with this hand position that we love so much, if I try to move my hips away, the tight waist stops me. If I try to come up to my shoulder, she'll always reestablish a cross face. So from here, I just angle my hips out like so. I can't move my hips away, but I can turn, lock up tight with the elbow, I can turn my hips towards my partner. And now from here, we switch to a cross wrist or cross elbow. From this position, we bridge into my partner. She goes to lock up tight with the tight waist. If I try to shrimp laterally along the mat, it's not going to work. So from here, I take the bite off the tight waist by bridging and coming up to the point of my right shoulder like so. Now she can go to pull me in as tight as she wants. She can go to cross face me with no cross face. When she goes to keep that tight waist, I just walk my hips away. And now she goes to recover the pin, I have all the inside position, and we can easily go into all bar coverings. Whenever I see a strong tight waist comes in, there's a very specific way to escape this. I take a cross post with my hand, and I move, I bridge, and I move into this position here. I'm on the point of my right shoulder. We'll talk about this more later when we talk about proper bridging from mount. And from here, I just walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, and you can always free your hips from your partner's tight waist. So you take away the effectiveness of the tight waist by bridging, by bringing your hips off the floor and rotating your hips in a way that unravels the hand from a strong tight waisting position. All right, so now let's look at, again, another less common upper body position your partner can use, but she can use it. So we'll look at escapes to this. My partner has a tight waist in place, and she has a near side underhook in place like so. So now you find yourself in a situation where even if my partner relinquishes a tight waist and she goes to move to double unders, it's still impossible for me to lock a side guard because of the fact that my right elbow is compromised. But this is not nearly as strong of a position, the near side underhook, as the tight waist in the cross face, because my partner has no real ability to, number one, keep this underhook, to number two, to elongate my body by opening up her elbow and stretching the cross face and moving me out of the way. She can do it to some degree. She can start opening up her elbow, but it's a pretty easy thing for me to stay in the same position because she's working at a much shorter lever. She's trying to open up her elbow below my shoulder line versus at the longest end of the lever of my spine, where now she opens up the elbow. Now I get bent out of position. So whenever I see a near side underhook is in place, this is usually not a position your partner pommels to when she's already in side control. It's usually like she passed you and you try to turn away maybe to create some kind of back exposure to then go into an escape and your partner ended up with a near side underhook and a tight waist. Whenever I see this, it's the easiest thing in the world to just come in and take a cross shoulder pose like so, and use this to create space to pommel the right elbow to the inside. When she goes to keep her left elbow in the inside position, it's the easiest thing to just pommel my hand to the inside. And now I have to address a tight waist. So from here, she's going to try to go into one of two directions. One is she's going to move to a body lock. She can lock her hands and she moves back out to the waist. She just locks her hands and we address the body lock like we did before. Two is she tries to move to a cross face. Or from here, I angle out. She puts a strong tight waist in. We take that cross pose and then we go into that same escape we looked at before and we just convert everything back to the same escapes we looked at previously. So less common, but pretty easy to deal with if you know how to. My partner has a strong tight waist on the far side and a near side underhook. We just pommel the hands back to the inside. And as she converts to a body lock, we go into body lock escapes. Or she tries to convert to a cross face. Then we go into the cross wrist or cross elbow post and go into escapes like that.
