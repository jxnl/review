 Hey everyone, we're back in Boston again with Fanatics and Little Miss Sunny. It's going to be a great day because I have a massive ear infection in my left ear, so I'm basically deaf on one side of my body. We're stuck in a blizzard and Nat's been complaining about working for like the last week, so it should be great. We're going to look at pin escapes today. Now, escapes and pin escapes specifically are pretty interesting because of the fact that when you get stuck in a bottom pin for long amounts of time, it is physically exhausting, it is mentally demoralizing, and pins are the number one way to get caught in defensive cycles for long amounts of time. If you spend one, two, three, four, five, six minutes in bottom side control or in bottom mount and you have someone on top of you who is forcing you to carry their body weight on your torso rather than your frames, it gets very exhausting and you get caught for long amounts of time in these defensive cycles. So what we're going to look at in this instructional is first ways to fight to upper body and side position and then eventually lower body and side position so that we can regain some kind of guard. So if my partner is inside control of me, I have to find ways to fight in situations where I'm carrying my partner's full body weight on my torso to ways where I can put frames inside and incrementally fight back to the inside position so that now I'm carrying her body weight on my frames instead of on my torso. So I can find ways to fight incrementally back to inside position. In addition, I'm going to look at ways to go from purely defensive cycles where we're on defense into offensive cycles where we can go back into some kind of attacking position as soon as we re-guard. So at the bare minimum, we're going to look at how to re-guard and get our guard back, but we're also going to look at ways to go a step further and look at ways to go from defensive cycles into offensive cycles. So for example, if she's mounted me, what most people show, you go for an escape and mount, you bump your partner forward, you go for a basic knee-elbow escape into half guard, you go for another knee-elbow escape into closed guard, and from here, you're in a neutral position where you went from a defensive cycle to neutral and now someone goes into attacks. Either I go for an arm bar, she opens up my guard, and then someone goes into an offensive cycle. All right, what we're going to look at is going a step further and eliminating that middle ground where instead of going from a defensive cycle into a neutral position, they go from a defensive cycle right into an offensive cycle, and they go right back into attacks. Okay, this is the best. The person who spends most of the time of the match in an offensive cycle is usually going to be the person who ends up winning the match or dominating most of the match. So what we can't have is situations where we're stuck for long amounts of time underneath someone's body weight in strong pins or stuck in defensive cycles and we're pushing on our partner and just as we were almost about to recover to a neutral position, she changes attacks and she goes back into an offensive cycle and we're caught for two, three, four, five, six minutes in these pins in defensive cycles. So the whole thing today is going to be about incrementally fighting back to the inside position and at least re-guarding and then going, if we can, from a purely defensive cycle and a bottom pin into an offensive cycle where you go right into a re-guard and then follow up with some kind of attack. So we talked about it a little bit in the intro. Let's talk about it now a little bit more in depth. Let's talk about carrying our partner's body weight. Okay. Whenever my partner can force me into a chest to chest position and force me to carry her body weight on my torso, this is when things become difficult and incredibly exhausting, physically exhausting. Okay. So if at any point she can put me into a side control, for example, and she can force me into full outside position and she can force me to carry her body weight for any length of time, this is going to be very exhausting for me and she's not really doing anything from here. And as I'm looking to start struggling and my hands coming out of position, she can start to isolate them and then go into her all of her favorite submission attacks or move through positional hierarchies. Okay. If you take a step back and we join knees and elbows together, she can lean her full body weight on top of me. She can lay on top of my full body and I could support her here with no issue for hours at a time. Okay. So whenever you're playing with either a guard retention, when you're looking at guard retention and your partner's trying to pass you, or when you're going in the, when you're taking a step back and going in the inverse and you're looking at pin escapes, we're looking always, we know we're going to be carrying our partner's body weight, but what we're looking for is to carry our partner's body weight on our frames rather than our torso. Okay. If she's trying to pass my guard and she goes for a toryando for example, and she comes in like so, and she goes to start coming in and passing me, I'm looking to retain my guard. If she gets chest to chest on me, she's not fully passed my guard yet, maybe we're struggling. If I'm carrying my partner's body weight through this guard pass, or if she's half guard and she's chest to chest and I'm carrying my partner's body weight on my torso from here, this is going to be exhausting for you. Okay. And over time it starts to weigh you down physically. But if she's trying to pass in half guard, for example, and I'm carrying her weight on my frames, or if she's trying to pass with a toryando for example, I'm carrying her weight with my frame, or now she goes to come in towards me from here. This is not nearly as physically exhausting as if I'm carrying her body weight with my torso. And the same is true for pin escapes, where I work into a situation where I'm escaping pins and we go at some point, we look at a pin escape, and then it kind of merges into a guard retention situation where I create chest to chest disconnection. And now she goes to solidify the pin and try to pin me once again. We're looking at more of a guard retention scenario, where now we're looking to take our partner's weight and carry it through our frames and not our torso. Okay. So whenever we're looking to retain guard, whenever we're looking to escape from pins and move back into a guard retention scenario, think about carrying your partner's weight on your frames rather than on your torso. It's much easier to carry your partner's weight on your shin, on your knees, on your elbows, and your forearms than it is when she's directly chest to chest. All right. So when we're talking about pin escapes, let's look at extension versus contraction and having concave versus convex shoulders. When we're looking at pin escapes, specifically side control and mount escapes, where our partner has heavy cross faces, what I'm looking to usually do is to create some kind of initial Kazushi. Okay. The big mistake everyone makes is that they start with a bridge and they finish with a bridge. What I need is I need some kind of initial Kazushi to off balance my partner. That usually comes from a bridge where I have full extension and I'm bridging out in a way like so. And then followed by some kind of contraction, which puts my head underneath and inside my partner's cross face and then move my head from a situation where it's exposed to the cross face to underneath my partner's chest. The cross face is much less effective. So if she's in mount, for example, big problem is that when she has a heavy cross face, for example, everyone starts and they give a big bridge out to one side and then they start and they finish with the bridge where they bridge and they try to just roll their partner over or whatever the case is. You laugh at this, but if you actually watch like most high level, like ADCC or Worlds mount escapes, especially Nogi when you can't grab onto the pants, a lot of them are just like explosive bridges and they just explode from side to side until they eventually roll the guy over, you know, buck a guy off into half guard. It's very low level as far as what's going on technically when you watch these guys escape. So most people start with a bridge and they finish with a bridge. What we're looking for is to start with a bridge and to create some kind of Kazushi. OK, and after the bridge, now my whole thing is to to to hide my jaw from the cross face. And I start with a bridge, I'm still exposing myself to a cross face. So my whole thing is I bridge with a full extension and then I move to some kind of contraction and I move to a concave shoulder position. So I bridge and now I move to a situation where now I'm no longer exposed to my partner's cross face. And now from here, this is when I can start to go in and start to escape. If she goes on the opposite side, I'm exposed to the cross face. If I bridge, I'm exposed to the cross face. My whole thing is a bridge where I have full extension and then full contraction where I go convex shoulders to concave shoulders. And now from here, when she has to put a strong cross face in, my head is underneath my partner's chest. If you look at the same situation from side control. And we're in a situation like so. If I start with a bridge, I'm still exposed to a heavy cross face. So I start with a bridge just to create some kind of initial pizoochie, an initial off-balance. And then from here, I go into a concave position where now when she has to cross face me, she has no purchase on my jaw and I can look to start to bring everything back to the inside position. Okay? So in general, we're escaping. And there are exceptions to this and one of the big exceptions is north-south because my partner doesn't have a cross face from north-south. She has no control over my head. I'll talk about that in a minute. But one of the big things we're going to be looking at today, when we're looking at escapes specifically from side control and from mounts, my partner has a heavy cross face, is starting with the big bridge to get an initial pizoochie. So starting with the full extension of our body to have some kind of off-balance and then quickly moving back to a concave position to start going into an initial bridge and then hiding our jaw from the cross face and getting our head underneath our partner's chest. So that now we don't carry the weight of the cross face and we can start putting our partner's hands on the floor, creating off-balances and working back to inside position. Okay? So it's very important that you can go both ways. You can't just go concave because you can't off-balance your partner and you can't just start with the big bridge and then continue through the bridge and then that's your whole escape. Okay? So you start with a bridge where you off-balance your partner and then you go into this concave position where you can start to bring everything back to the inside, clear cross faces and then get your inside position back and go into your counter attacks. All right. So let's look at a very important rule. We're looking at pin escapes and a rule my partner has to follow if she wants to attack me. Now side control and mount are one thing and north-south is another. All right? When my partner is looking to effectively attack me, control me and attack me with submissions from side control or mount, she has to have control of my head and shoulders. Okay? Direct control over my head and shoulders in some way. If we're in side control, like so, and she has control over my head and shoulders, she can pin me and she can attack me from here. If she has no control over my head and shoulders and she goes to pin me and she goes to attack me from here, it won't be possible. The same goes for mount. If she has control over me like so, with control of my head and shoulders, she can attack me. If she's postured up, for example, before she can attack me, okay, obviously if there's striking involved then she could just punch me in the face, but in our sport does not. So she has to first isolate a limb, control my head, and then come forward and get some kind of cross face, at least a cross face, a cross face and an underhook or two underhooks, and she has to have direct control over my head and shoulders before she can effectively attack me. Okay? So, one of the things we're looking at here, same method, is to find ways to free our head and shoulders from control of our partner. Okay? If I can get to a situation where I fight my limbs to the inside position and my partner no longer has control over my head, everything starts to fall apart in terms of her being able to pin me and especially being able to attack me. Okay? So if at any point she's down in a cross face and she has hips down low, like so, if at any point I can move to a situation where I can clear the cross face and I can stop her from controlling my head and shoulders, like so, now the pins start to fall apart. If she's across side and side control, if at any point I can find ways to start clearing my head from control of my partner when she goes to start keeping the pin and going into attacks now, everything falls apart. Okay? So understand that what we're going to be looking to do when we're looking to escape side control and mount is to deny partner control of your head and shoulders. The same thing when we're looking at guard passing and retention. When she goes to pass me, I'm looking to deny my partner the cranial shift. I'm looking to deny her control of my head and shoulders. So now from here, when she gets to start pinning me, she can't control my head and shoulders, she can't pin me. And I can easily re-guard and go back into my attacks. And the one exception to this is north-south. If she's behind me, like so, and in north-south, now she has no direct control over my head and shoulders, but she can still start isolating my arms and going into attacks and start to give me problems from here without direct control over my head. Okay? So the one exception to this is going to be north-south. If your partner's in side control or in mount, she has to have direct control over your head and shoulders if she wants to effectively pin and attack you. If she's in north-south, however, the rules kind of change from here. So we're going to look at this a little bit later, but our main goal from north-south is going to be finding ways to convert my partner back into that perpendicular position where she's forced to move back into a side control. And as she does, then deny her control over my head and shoulders and effectively escape. Okay? So understand the rule about your partner controlling your head and shoulders. Side control and mount, she has to have control over the head and shoulders to pin and attack you. But in north-south, she doesn't. All right, so now let's look at the easiest and hardest ways to escape from pins. Many of you have watched attacking from top pins. And as I talked about, the most unstable time in top pins is the intermediary step between static positions. Okay? So when I'm attacking from top pins, I'm very stable here in side control. Right? And I'm very stable here in mount. Right? But the time between side control and mount, the intermediary stage, where I have to move from a static position into a dynamic pin and make a move from side control into mount, this is when I'm most vulnerable being off-balanced. Okay? So, when you're looking at escaping from bottom pins, the easiest time to escape is when your partner is moving dynamically from one position to another, or palm-length from one position to another. Okay? Whenever there's movement, movement is your friend. That's going to get you out. The hardest time to escape from a bottom pin is when your partner's hunkered down and has no interest in moving around or doing anything. It's just sitting. You're just sitting right here. And now when she goes to start bridging around and moving around, it's tough because you're not moving. Okay? So, from a tactical standpoint, it's going to be much more efficient. You're going to conserve a lot more energy if you wait to escape. If you have the time to do so. Maybe you don't always have the time to do so, and you have to get out right away. But if you do have the time to do so, wait until your partner goes to make a move, and that is your time to start off-balancing and going into escapes. Okay? So, you're going to try to escape when your partner's in a very static position with his tension running through the whole body, and now you're bridging and trying to move around, and your partner's not moving at all. Okay? So, just from a tactical standpoint, understand that it's going to be much easier to escape when your partner's moving through the intermediary positions between static positions. Okay? And, when your partner's hunkered down, she has a tight cross face, a tight underhook, and she's not moving at all, those are going to be the hardest times to escape. All right? So, depending on if you're competing, where you are in a match, whatever the case is, sometimes you won't always be able to wait, and you'll have to be able to make space right away. But if you can, it's always better to wait until your partner relaxes a little bit, starts to move around, and then as they move, you work towards an escape. All right, let's look at a very general overview of what we're going to be looking at today. We're going to start off with a situation where my partner's past my legs, and she's still at range. So, knee on belly. So, the first thing we're going to look at is, she gets past my legs, she shoots a knee on belly, how can we go in and stop our partner from passing us and recover from here and go into counterattacks from knee on belly? Then we're going to look at how to stop my partner from transitioning from a knee on belly as she goes through the intermediary steps of trying to pin me into side control, how can I stop her midway through and recover as she's trying to go from knee on belly into side control? Okay? Then we're going to look at going into escape from side control, like so, going into all of our basic escapes and more advanced escapes from here, whether she has a top-headed arm, whether she has double underhooks, whether she has her hips square, whether she sits her hips through, whether she has different upper body grips, different leg placements, and things like that. We're going to go through all variations of side control, and then we're going to look at escaping and recovering when she's in the process of moving to north-south, so whether she takes one arm over first, like so, and goes to make a transition, or whether she takes her underhook arm out first and goes to make the transition, escaping as she goes to move to north-south, and re-guarding from there. Then we're going to go into north-south, and we're going to go into escaping from north-south, both with two major positions, with her knees on the floor, and with a high tripod, like so. Okay? Then we're going to go into escaping as she goes to transition back to side control, like so, or from here, she goes to transition back to side control, I catch her in the intermediary steps, and then I can re-guard from there. After we do that, we're going to work on escaping as she goes to move from side control into mount. So again, she's moving through this dynamic pinning position, the intermediary steps, how I can go in and off balance my partner and escape as she's moving into a mounted position. And then finally, once she's actually mounted, how I can go in and start to escape with her having me mounted, with various hand positions, whether it be she's postured up with no control, whether she has a cross face on me, whether she has a cross face and underhook, whether she has two underhooks, and moving through different and various hand positions, like so. Okay? So, belly, side control, north-south, mount, and everything in between, all the intermediary steps and all the dynamic pins of her moving from one position to another, because that's the easiest time for her to escape. As she goes to move from one position into another, she will be the most off balance, and it will be easiest for us to off balance her as she's moving through those positions. Okay? So, just a general overview of how we're going to do things today. So let's look at first, knee on belly escapes when our partner gets past our legs and goes into a traditional knee on belly. Most of the escapes you see, people will show you go in and push on your partner's knee, push the knee out and away, then go into shrimping and very basic recoveries from there. I'm not going to say that this can't work. Okay? You can do this, but you run into a few problems. Number one, with anyone talented, if you take two of your hands and put them on your partner's knee, there's nothing stopping your partner from closing the distance between her chest and your chest. There's nothing stopping your partner from getting control of your head, like so, pulling you in. And then the second I start to go push my partner's knee, you're always going to encounter first a strong collar tie, second, a right hand coming in as an underhook, and as you get to push the knee down, the knee will come off and it'll just crash the far shoulder with her head and now you end up flattened out with your top side control and your partner has made the cranial shift and she can flatten you out. Okay? So, a much better option from here, this is my go-to knee on belly escape. Whenever I see someone playing with their traditional knee on belly, she comes forward and she's in a situation like so. It's from here, I immediately take a cross lat post, like so. So that from here, if at any point she goes to come forward and crash down chest to chest, I dominate my partner's shoulder line, the line that draws her two shoulders together, through this cross lat post and my forearm. So now, when she goes to make connection to my chest with her, she can't, and she can get control over my head, but it's not a meaningful connection because I can always use my hand to start moving her around and putting her hands on the floor. Okay? Now, from this position, I'm going to take my right hand and I'm going to scoop it right under my partner's ankle, like so. So I'm elbow deep around my partner's ankle and I have this cross lat post here. Now I'm going to use my left foot on the floor as a drive leg and I'm just going to put my right knee on my partner's tailbone. When she goes to sit back and away from me, it's the easiest thing in the world to use my left hand as a direction hand, to use my right leg, or left leg as a drive leg, and to use my right knee as a bump to take my partner forwards and put her hands on the floor. Now from here, this left hand is going to switch from a cross lat to a cross hamstring. And now my knees come to my chest and I move into this concave position. So you notice we go from a full extension where we bump our partner forwards, like so, into a full contraction where now I have minimal friction with myself on the floor. And this left direction hand will allow me to easily spin into a situation like so. From this position, because of the fact that I have an elbow deep grip on my partner's leg, when she goes to run away from me, tries to pull her leg out quickly, it's a difficult thing. Because I have a post on my partner's hamstring, when she tries to back step from here, it's not impossible but it's a difficult thing. And this from here will give me time to start taking my legs through, where from here I can take my left foot as a post to my partner's hamstring, I can stretch the legs apart. And now you can drive a truck through the space between her knees, that's the easiest thing in the world to fire my right leg over, and from here you have a choice of going into various leg configurations from backside 50-50 and exposing your partner's heel for the win. So forward knee on belly, my partner passes the leg and she gets to a traditional knee on belly like so. The two things I'm worried about is number one, my partner coming down chest to chest. Number two, forgetting some kind of control over my head and shoulders, whether it be with a collar tie, whether it be with an underhook, or worst case scenario, locked hands with a cross face and an underhook. So the first thing I look to do is immediately I stop her from controlling my head and shoulders. So we put the cross lat post in like so, and if I feel her pulling herself in with that hand, I just take either a backhand frame like so and we wipe the frame off, or beforehand we can go to an inside bicep tuck. So now she goes to control my head, it's a difficult thing. When she goes to control my head, it's a difficult thing. And now from here we put a left leg post on the floor, and we put our right knee on our partner's tailbone. From here when she goes to control the position, I just bump her forward and my left hand wipes everything over my left shoulder. So she goes to control knee on belly, like so. As I do that, I'm going to bump my partner forward, once I know I'm going to bump her forward, it's okay now for me to relinquish the inside bicep tie. As I'm going to bump her forward, we just switch to a scoop grip, like so. And now from here it's the easiest thing to start moving myself into a situation where our bodies form this T and are perpendicular. Now I take a cross hamstring post on my partner with my opposite hand, and we just fire ourselves into this near parallel position, like so. I post to my partner's hamstring, she goes to rip out and away, she can't because of my right arm. She goes to back step, it's delayed. And now from here I put a post in, I split my partner's knees. I fire my right leg through, and now from here we can go into a variety of different leg configurations and go in and look to start breaking our partner. So she's going to be, once again, knee on belly. She comes in and she's playing this game here. From here she goes to drive forward, I feel she can't get chest to chest, she can't control my head. I put a knee on her tailbone, I put a foot on the floor, and now as I bump her forward, I just wipe her across my left shoulder, we take a scoop grip, and we move to this perpendicular angle. From here, the cross lat post won't be enough to push me all the way parallel. So I take cross lat to cross hamstring. Now when she goes to push back to her heels, I can always create an angle sufficient enough to fire my legs through. We can lock in various different ways, and backside 50-50, and from here we can go in, lock up, and break our partner, or at least put heat on her, and at the bare minimum we're out of the knee on belly situation. So I'm not going to say that posting in your partner's knee and shrimping away can't work against someone who's relatively low level. But against anyone high level, they're always looking to get control of the head and shoulders. So when I see that, I first deny a cranial shift. The cross lat post comes in, inside bicep comes in, she can't get chest to chest, she can't control my head and my shoulders. It's all about putting the hands on the floor, creating an initial kazoo-shi, and then using that direction hand to get to an angle where you can fire the legs in, enter into your partner's legs, and then she'll think twice about going into a knee on belly next time because she knows that if she does, her legs are going to be exposed and backside 50-50. All right, so now let's look at kind of a hybrid position that you've seen me use in my passing instructionals. Between a knee on belly, it's not really a true knee on belly, but it's not really a true shin mount because of the fact that you don't have upper body connection. And let's look at how we can escape provided my opponent goes into this position. So now what is this position, first of all? Steer down. So a typical knee on belly is I have knee on belly like so, I have a leg out for base, and I have my knee pointing toward my partner's far shoulder. This is a classical knee on belly position. A shin mount is when I have a situation where I have upper body control and I move into a mounted position like so, and I have my shin riding across my partner's hips. So I'm technically mounted, but I don't have a full classical mount, I have a shin mount. So I'm mounted with my shin across my partner's hips. Now there can be a hybrid between these two positions where I have the lower body position of a shin mount, but the upper body position of a knee on belly, where I'm riding over my partner's upper body like so, and I have a figure four, or I have leg and foot connected, I have a shin mount situation like so with my lower body, but no real upper body connection. So it looks to a third party viewer almost like a knee on belly, but it's not really a true knee on belly because of the fact that there's no space between my knees for my partner to exploit with traditional escapes that we just looked at. So the question is, if I get to this position, how can I escape? Because now there's no doorway for my partner to exploit between my knees for her to enter into my legs. The question is, how can we escape this kind of hybrid position here? When I see this, my partner comes in, I try, normally this will come out, she's in a regular knee on belly. Normally, my partner will move to this position when she sees me trying to access the far leg. So she moves into this position and she starts hovering over my body like so. The second I see this, I'm immediately going to take my right hand and post it on my partner's hip and take my right elbow to the inside of my partner's knee. So just posture up. So I just take my hand to the hip and I take my elbow inside of my partner's knee like so. Now my partner is going to be pushing back towards my hips, which means it's going to be an incredibly difficult thing to do from here. So I start bumping my partner forward and getting her weight moving forward. So what I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to take left foot to the floor and right knee to tailbone once again. Now I bump her forward, not with the intention of actually taking her weight forward, just with the intention of off-balancing her and getting her weight off of my hips for a split second. So I bump forward like so, and now from here I just shrimp, shrimp, shrimp, shrimp into this position here. And now we're in this perpendicular angle. Now she has a choice from here. If she tries to, a lot of people try to run out and away when they feel their legs being emptied into. So I feel from here my partner tries to sprint out and away, I just scoot my partner's leg, and then we fire right back into that backside 50-50 position. Commonly what will happen is from here my partner will try to sit back onto her hips exactly in her cover position. The second I scoot out into this angle, the second I see my partner go to scoot and sit back down, I just immediately throw my knee and connect it to my elbow like so, into a side guard position which we'll talk about more as we move into side control escapes. And now once I have this knee and elbow connection, once she goes to make any meaningful connection between my upper body and hers, it's the easiest thing to fight everything back to the inside position and move into a winning situation where we can re-guard. And then once we're in position, if she overextends towards me, we can start moving into clamp positions, we can start moving into scoops in the legs, and we can do all of our counter attacks which we'll look at when we get into our side control escapes in a minute. But this time she comes in, she goes knee on belly, she shoots past my legs, I try to scoop the leg, and from here I feel I can't bump my partner forward. Now the biggest danger is that people try to push on the knee, try to push on the hips, underhooks come in, and she gets chest to chest contact and control over my head. So from here, the second I see this, I immediately take a cross lat like so, or a cross shoulder post is good as well. From here, I take my elbow inside and my hand inside. When she goes to punch an underhook in from here, it's a difficult thing. Even if she gets inside my right arm, it means nothing. I can always bump her forward and I can put her hand back on the floor. So as she gets to punch an underhook in, we can bump our partner forward and off balance. The purpose of the off balance is not to push my partner so far forward where I can start to invert underneath her. The purpose of the off balance is just to get her weight off of my hips and put her weight forward onto the hands for a split second. So I bump forward like so, and now I just shrimp. Like so. Most people from here will try to chase my hips, and as they do so, we just bring knees and elbows together. And now we pummel a hand to the inside of my partner's bicep when she goes to control my head. There's no way she can do so. And now from here is the easiest thing to go into at least a recovery and any kind of follow-up attack that you want. So she's in this kind of hybrid knee on belly shin mount scenario. First thing we do is we come into a situation like so. Now she goes to recover. The pretty easy thing to get everything back to the inside position. So instead of taking my partner forward into an inversion into my partner's legs, I take her forward just enough to get weight off my hips, and then I just shrimp and knee-elbow escape. So one, two, three, four. What's stopping her from following me is this hand inside my partner's hip. So from here, as she has to start following me and circling with me, you have more than enough time and more than enough space to start inverting into your partner's legs. If she chooses to stay in that elevated position, or if she sits back down towards her hips and puts all the weight back on her heels, knees come to elbows, everything fights back to the inside position, and we can easily go into a full recovery. She's been yapping, yapping, yapping. It's the first scene of the day. The last scene that we shot was at like 5 p.m. yesterday, and now we're here again, and we're filming and just complaining, complaining, complaining. I'm the one with the ear infection. I can't even hear out of my left ear, and she's just yapping, yapping. I'm going to turn my head like this so I can't hear you. Oh my gosh. Do you want me to teach today? All right. So we're going to look at going into side control escapes now, okay? There's a couple of general directions my partner can start to move in. There's different hand positions, different body positions, but our main goal is going to be to incrementally fight limbs back to the inside position and get to a situation where we're not carrying our partner's body weight on our torso, but we have frames inside, and we can bring everything back to the inside position and re-guard and then go into counter attacks, all right? The main things we're going to be looking at today is escapes where we start by turning towards our partner and escapes where we start by turning away from our partner, and this will be contingent upon my partner's body positions. If my partner crowds my head with her upper body like so, now it's going to be a good time to start turning towards my partner and inserting knees or punching in underhooks and coming into attacks on my partner's legs and things like that. In the event that my partner crowds my hips and points my knees away from her, now I won't be able to turn towards her because of the orientation of her body. Now I'll start with escapes that start pointing away from me first where I start to go in and go into escapes where I initially start by turning away, and then we can eventually turn in and re-guard and go into counter attacks. General directions of our partner from here, there's many different hand positions, different leg positions, different hip positions, but in general she can play a game where she either chases my head and shoulders with her hips like so, whether it be here, whether she sits her hips through like so, or she can play a game where she chases my hips and from here she circles towards my hips so that now I can't point my knees towards her and look to go into our classical and generic re-guards and counter attacks. We have to be able to deal with both of these and we're going to look at how to do so in the following clips. All right, so when we're talking about recovering from side control. Assuming I can point my knees towards my partner, if you can lock a side guard, you've won the game, you're out. Okay, unless your partner is highly, highly advanced and unlocks the hand and makes a transition to situations where she's out of side control and she unlocks her hands and she makes adjustments. Assuming she keeps her hands locked, there's no way your partner can threaten you and you're always going to be able to recover. All right, so now what is a side guard? I'm sure many of you have seen this in other instructional clips, assuming you haven't. A side guard is a near knee and elbow connection, like so, that form a V between my knee and my elbow. If at any point my partner has me in a side control and I can connect knee and elbow, like so, and form this V and this structure between myself and my partner, she can no longer attack me. You have won the game and I know it doesn't look like it because their hands are still locked, but you are 100% in the driver's seat from here. When she goes to attack you in any way, if she unlocks her hands, the second she unlocks her hands and switches to a Kimura or a move position, the second she unlocks her hands, I just take the inside position back. So now she's forced to a position where she has to keep her hands locked. And as she goes to keep her hands locked, I can incrementally fight my way back to inside position, whether it be here, whether it be here, and from here. There's many ways that we can go fighting our way back to the inside position, unlocking your partner's hands, and then bringing everything back to the inside at a bare minimum. So if at any point we can lock a side guard, or I get a knee and elbow connection, like so, and I form this V, and I put this wedge between myself and my partner, understand if you get here, you've won the game. You're going to be able to recover from here. Now if I get to this position and then for whatever reason I'm moving around and my elbow and my knee disconnect and she exploits that with her hip position, now you've lost battle and she can recover from here. But if at any point we can get to this side guard, understand how crucial this is. If you get here, you are going to escape. And from here, we can incrementally fight and let us back to the inside and get into all of our favorite re-guards and counter attacks. So understand that working in side control, if we can point our knees towards our partner, get to a side guard. If we can get to a side guard, we can usually always escape. So let's look at insertion points. There are key insertion points all over our partner's body that we have to be able to exploit to insert our limbs into the inside position and then go into our escapes. So from side control, there are two major insertion points we can be looking at. One, if my partner is on top of me in side control, is a hand inside and underneath my partner's jaw like so. So the insertion point will be in the space between my partner's ear and my partner's shoulder. If she closes that window, I won't be able to insert my far hand inside and this will cause some problems because then I won't have the hand inside to start bridging and creating space and creating my initial off balance. So from here, I take a hand and I insert it inside the space between my partner's ear and far shoulder. The next will be in my partner's hips. There's one insertion point on the hip and I use the insertion point to insert one, my elbow inside my partner's hip. So my left elbow, my near elbow can insert inside my partner's hip like so. And then from here, my knee can insert inside my partner's hip like so. And when you go to insert your hands into one of these two slash three insertion points, you have to be very specific in the way that you do it. And we'll talk about fighting the far hand inside like so. We'll talk about inserting the near side elbow like so. We'll talk about slipping the knee inside of our partner's hip like so. So there are two major insertion points we're talking about when we're looking at side control. One is at our partner's far shoulder here with the far arm and the other is elbow inside the hip and knee inside the hip on the opposite side. Okay, so the hip insertion points are the same. You're just inserting an elbow at one and a knee at the other. If we're looking at a mounted position like so, now the main insertion point we're going to be looking at is again, if we have hands inside like so, we can pommel hands inside of our partner's shoulder just so we get some side control. And more importantly, when we look to go into kipping escapes, we're going to look at insertion points on our partner's tailbone. So here I have knee and tailbone connection. And from here, I insert a knee to the inside position and we can go in and start forming connections to our partner, the ashi garamis and escapes. Okay. So we're going to be looking at some key insertion points, both from side control and from mount. Now with north south, they're a little bit different because my partner has no control over my head. Okay. So we're working in a north south scenario. This time, my insertion point will be right inside my partner's collarbone and shoulders. Where from here, I can lift like so, and I just can insert a knee right into my partner's collarbone and shoulder like so. So now when she goes to put pressure on me, it's a pretty easy thing to start making space, insert my second knee, and now I have all the inside position. Okay. So my partner has no control over my head this time, so the insertion point comes a little bit differently because of the change of position. Okay. From this position, I'm not inserting a knee inside of her hip or an elbow inside of her hip or a hand inside the shoulder. We're taking a knee right inside the shoulder and inside the collarbone. So now when she goes to put pressure on me, I have a knee elbow connection. From here, we can put a second knee in and start to go into escapes. Okay. So understand that there are key insertion points all around our partner's body we have to be able to exploit for escapes. And this doesn't just go for escapes, it goes for attacks as well. We talked about this when we were talking about back attacks. We're looking to insert a hand and for a strangle, we're looking for a key insertion point which is behind our partner's jaw. Or from here, we can insert a knuckle, walk the hand down, and from here, walk the hand across and go for strangles. Okay. So there are key insertion points all around our partner's body which we have to be able to exploit both offensively and defensively. And we'll elaborate on this in terms of escapes as we move forward. All right. Let's talk about ways to insert your far arm and get a hand underneath your partner's jaw. The number one way to do this, and the easiest way to do this, is to play a waiting game. And you wait for your partner to start moving, wait for their grips to loosen, for them to start moving into mount or moving to attack your arms with kimuras or moving to north-south. And as they move, you pummel a hand inside. This is the number one way to do this. Now if your partner's in a static position, there's ways we can force this assuming your partner doesn't want to move. All right. So let's take a look at that. So we're going to be flattened out like so, and the number one way that we can do this is we just play with the hand in close to my partner's shoulder like so. And now as she goes to start moving around and head comes out of position, we just pummel the hand to the inside. We take a V-grip on our partner's shoulder like so. So this is the finishing position we want to be in. Now there's always going to be times where we feel like our partner's not moving and we have to pummel his hand to the inside position. If your partner has no connection of her ear and her shoulder, there's no reason why I can't just pummel a hand through. If I feel that there's a connection, but it's a pretty weak connection, I just put a hand in and I just get small incremental bumps. One, two, three, and then my hand comes across. All right. There's always going to be a time where our partner has a strong ear to shoulder connection and her chin is up high by my shoulder. But now from here, I feel like I'm trying to insert my hand and it's just not working. So a couple of great ways of doing this is by one, bridging towards my partner and two, bridging away from my partner. If my shoulders are square and flat on the floor, it's going to be hard to insert my hand because the simple fact that she has good ear to shoulder connection and my hand rubs into my own chest because my shoulders are square. So the first thing I want to look to do is your traditional bridge into your partner, where from here, as I bridge, I take my bicep right to the top of my partner's head. Okay. At the longest end of the lever, where you feel like you're not going to get slippage where the arm slips across and you put yourself in a kind of a cover. So from here, I just bring my feet into my butt. I look over my left shoulder and I give a bridge with the intention of separating my partner's ear and shoulder like so. And now from here, I just turn my palm up towards the ceiling and I pummel my hand to the inside position. And now as we're going to come back down to the floor, we scoot the hand across and we insert the hand inside. So whenever I see my partner has a strong connection, ear to shoulder, from here, I feel like I can insert my hand. So I just bridge into my partner with the intention of taking her left ear away from the shoulder and putting her right ear as close to the shoulder as possible. So when she has to keep a strong frame with her head, I bridge and I move the opposite ear to the shoulder. I exploit the space now and I pummel the inside position. And from here, we come back down and we bring everything inside. So she's locked up tight, tight, tight. I give a strong bridge. I pummel to the inside and we come back down like so. If I feel my partner, for whatever reason, is not allowing me to insert my hand, bridging into her this direction, maybe she had my left arm shelf really high with her legs, walk up towards my shoulders. And from here, I just can't get a bridge in that direction. Whenever I see I can't insert a hand, I can't bridge towards my partner to insert a hand. This time, I'm just going to give a small bridge and I'm going to shrimp away from my partner. Okay. I'm going to shrimp towards my partner rather. Instead of shrimping out in this direction, I'm going to bring my hips towards my partner like so. I'm just going to shoot my left shoulder forwards. What this does is it gives me space, not between her ear and her shoulder, but it gives me space by angling my shoulders. She has that connection. From here, as I go to insert my hand, it doesn't hit my own chest anymore. It comes inside. Now, from here, when she goes to start stopping me from bringing the hand inside, I can easily insert the hand and we have the inside position that we're looking for. From here, this time, I can't bridge into my partner. I can't insert my hand. I give a small bridge away from my partner and I just scoop my hips out like so and I punch my near side shoulder forward. When she goes to keep that head position in strong, we just take our hand and we just slip it right inside here. Now my hand doesn't run into my own chest because my shoulders are angled. When she goes to stop me now, I just flatten myself back out and put everything in. She goes to lock up tight so that I can't bridge towards her. I can't insert the hand. She's not moving from this position. I'm like, oh man, this is terrible. I'm going to get stuck here for long amounts of time. From here, I try to bridge towards my partner and it fails. I bridge away and I shrimp. From here, we just pummel the hand inside by turning the thumb up towards the ceiling. If I try to go in with thumb down, you're always going to run into your partner's shoulder. I pummel the thumb towards the ceiling. Strong connection. I pummel the thumb towards the ceiling and from here, it just slips inside. If I feel like it's almost there but I can't quite insert, then from here, as I go to start flattening myself out, I just give small bumps. We get a hand inside. From this position, she goes to lock up tight. Thumb down will always get stuck. I turn my thumb up. Now, she goes to lock in tight, tight, tight. Get the hand across and from here, we can insert that hand. If we're going towards our partner like so, I turn thumb down, hand comes in. If we're bringing our hips towards our partner like so and we're turning out and away, from here, if I go thumb down, you're always going to run into your partner's shoulders. From here, I turn thumb up and now she goes to stop me. It's a pretty easy thing to scoot that hand by and get the inside hand position at the far side. Now, we can insert our right hand. Now, let's look at inserting a near side elbow inside my partner's hip. Let's talk about now inserting a near side elbow inside of our partner's hip. Now, understand you should be trying to insert the far side hand and the near side elbow simultaneously. When one comes in, the other is much easier to establish. It's much easier to establish the inside position with the opposite arm. At any point, I can get my right arm inside like so and my left arm is outside. Understand that now, when you start to hit your bridging, you can use this arm to create some additional space in order to move your partner around and hit kizushis and insert the left elbow. From here, when you have no inside position, when you go to bridge, you're going to have minimal effect moving your partner around. If I have this inside forearm across my partner's shoulders, it's going to be a pretty easy thing to start getting my partner's head in and out, creating angles, and getting elbows to the inside. There's always going to be a time, though, when from here, I can't get my right arm inside and my partner's head position is so good, I absolutely just cannot get my hand inside. She's in death grip from here and I have to start working at my left elbow. Understand too, if your partner has a high shelf, if she walks towards my head and she has great head position here, there's going to be times from here where you just get stuck and you have to wait for your partner to move. You've lost the battle for so many pieces of inside position. If your partner's here and there's just a death grip on you, it can be very hard to escape these positions. But understand, your partner's going to have to eventually move in order to submit you. So I'm not going to say that if your partner's just squeezing as hard as she can from here, you're always going to be able to get out. Sometimes it will legitimately just get pinned here and then as your partner goes to move, then you can start going in and finding elbows to the inside and as she moves, we can fight back to the inside position. There's only so much you can do from here. So let's assume that from this position, my partner has my elbow shelved. The first thing we're going to look to do is basic elbow insertion. Where from here, we look to start bridging into our partner and from here, we take our hand and we move it out like so. So that our hand is coming down towards the floor like so. What this will allow me to do is to invert my left elbow. If I bridge and I try to bring my elbow down from this position and my hand is directly over my partner's hip, you will always run into your partner's hip bone. So instead I change the angle and I bring my hand down towards the floor. So now as I go to invert my elbow, it slips inside my partner's hip much easier. If I try to go and bridge like so and try to slice my elbow down, I slice it into my partner's hip bone, whereas from here, if I turn the hand out like so, I can easily slip inside my partner's hip and steal the inside position. So our first and most basic one is from here, I give a bridge out and over my left shoulder. If I have an inside hand, this is even easier. I give a strong bridge, I look to start off balance my partner from here and my hand moves with my partner's body like so. And now we can insert the elbow inside and bring everything back to the inside position. Okay. If I feel like my partner's knees are spread apart to a degree where I can't get a sufficient bridge to off balance my partner, I'm trying to bridge, but I'm bridging right into her base of support. What I can do is I can take my elbow as I bridge and I can bring it down to my partner's knee like so. What this does is it will put a wedge outside my partner's knee. So that as I go to bridge, I can clamp down on my partner's knee and I can put a wedge so that it off balances her to a degree where she has to take her knee and step over my elbow. If she doesn't do this, many times you'll see people just fall over. Okay. Now no one's ever going to fall over realistically. I think actually Andre Galvali got taken over with this, with this in a, in an MMA fight a few times. It's not, not positive, but I think that happened. If she doesn't do anything and she just stays in this position, I can just bump her over like so, with a strong enough bridge. Okay. If she keeps her knee in position and she goes to fall over and she posts a cross face hand, now it's the easiest thing in the world to just go in and get a full regard because now she has no control of your head. So what she's always going to do from here is she's going to take the knee and as I go to drive, as I bridge over the shoulder, I pull the left elbow down and I just wedge outside my partner's knee. So this forces her to take her knee out of position and move it over my elbow to accommodate the bridge. And when I see that, I just slip the elbow to the inside position. And now from here we have a winning game with the inside elbow. So when I see my partner's knees are based far apart and made my elbow shelf a little bit higher and I feel like I can't bridging invert the elbow. Whenever I see this, I give a big bridge and I just windmill my elbow down to the floor and move up a little higher. Just windmill my elbow up and over the knee. I can't do it right from here, so I bridge and I give a big bridge and as I bridge, I just whip my hand down to the knee like so. And now I start bridging, bridging, bridging. She has to take the knee over and I take the elbow to the inside position. Okay. So this time we have one, our generic inside elbow position where I bridge towards my partner, we insert the elbow. We have an outside knee wedge where we can bridge and get our elbow to the inside. If at any point I can do this with the right elbow inside, these will both be much stronger. And finally, if I feel for whatever reason, bridging towards my partner, isn't going to be an option and a bridging towards my partner and scooting my hips away from here, I look to start turning my hips out and away from my partner like so. From here I bridge out and away from my partner and I scoot my hips in towards my partner and I shoot my left shoulder forward like so. And now from here, I just invert the elbow inside my partner's hips. And from here we bring everything back to the inside position. This time I'm shelves. I feel like I can't go inside. Okay. There's no way I can insert like so. From here I turn away from my partner and I just punch my left shoulder forward by punching my left shoulder forward. What this does is it takes my partner's elbow and knee away from one another like so. And that will give me space between my partner's knee and elbow connection and give me the ability to elongate my partner's body and insert my elbow inside my partner's hip. So from this position, I feel like I can't bridge towards my partner. None of those are working. She goes to lock up tight. I can't insert my elbow. I can move it around. I can't insert my elbow. From here I bridge away from my partner and I scoot my hips towards my partner. So when she goes to lock up tight, we slip the elbow inside and from here we have inside position and then we can fight to the inside with our right hand. And as this is happening, you should be trying to fight simultaneously right hand and left elbow to the inside position. So your partner's not fighting a battle at just one, just one given area. She's fighting to keep the inside position at both the far side of the body and the near side of the body. When you're fighting back and forth to get both limbs inside, eventually one peeks in and once one is inside, it's easier to get the second one inside. All right, so let's say that we have two hands, two elbows inside and my opponent allows me to get my crucial elbow positioning inside theirs. How can we escape when someone is naive and allows us to get the elbow inside? So like I said, we're trying to fight simultaneously to get far hand inside and near elbow inside. If at any point we can get the far hand inside, we can start bridging and make it easier for us to get the near elbow inside. And if at any point we can put the near elbow inside, we can start to use that to start to make space away from my partner and then from here look to insert a hand to the inside. Whenever one comes in, it's much easier to achieve the other inside, to get the other inside. Now, let's assume that my partner is moving around or she's not tense in the correct way and she allows my right elbow to slip inside. Ultimately what's keeping me trapped here is the fact that her left elbow is inside my right elbow. If my right elbow at any point slips inside her left elbow, now she has no control over me. Okay, so let's assume that from this position we take two V-grips in our partner's armpit like so and we're moving around and my partner, for whatever reason, allows me to slip my elbow inside. Maybe she goes to unlock her hands and goes to move position and she doesn't realize that I have two V-grips in her armpits and for whatever reason my right elbow slips inside my partner's elbow like so. Whenever you see that you have your elbow inside your partner's far elbow, this is always a time to just bring knees and elbows together. I'm going to give a quick bridge where I just bridge up straight up like so and I lift with my hands to get my head underneath my partner's chest. Right now I'm exposed to the cross face. We want to apply that same idea of going into a full bridge, full extension, and then going into a full contraction where we go concave shoulders to clear my partner's cross face. She puts a heavy cross face in from here. If I try to bring my knees and elbows together now, I just push a deeper cross face in. From here I give a quick bridge and I just lift with my two hands. Then from here I go into a concave position. Now because I have all the upper body inside position when she goes to recover, I just bring my two knees and elbows together. From this position it's the easiest thing in the world to take my hands and knees back inside and then from here we can easily insert a butterfly hook and come to a full butterfly guard. We can easily go to a scissor guard. We throw our two feet up across and now my partner goes in a circle in either direction. I can easily follow her. We can easily start scooping into my partner's legs and going into leg attacks. There's various things we can do from here. Again, for the naive opponent it allows us to get two frames inside like so and two V grips on our partner's armpit. For whatever reason the elbow slips to the inside position. Whenever I see this I just give a quick bridge like so. I lift with the arms and I move to this concave position like so. Now from here knees and elbows connect. When she goes to put pressure on me now she runs right into my frames and it's the easiest thing in the world to start going into situations where I can go into re-guards and preferably counter attacks. Alright, so this is pretty rare but it does happen. Your partner goes to move position. She realizes you're fighting back to inside position. Maybe she unlocks her hands and goes to change position and she ends up with her elbow outside. We just give a quick bridge, knee to elbow connection and we can go into recovery.
