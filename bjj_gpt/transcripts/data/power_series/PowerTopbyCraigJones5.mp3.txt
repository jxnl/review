 Guys, when we are trying to body lock past someone, a lot of people think that, obviously in the name, body lock locks in there. They think they have to keep their hands closed the entire time, right? There are situations where we can open our hands to keep the action going. Sometimes we will lock a body lock around someone and they really make no attempt to escape and we will just be sitting there for a long time. We can't just hang out in positions like that because we are allowing the bottom guy to rest. We want to be applying pressure the whole time. We want to be keeping them reacting. So we want to keep that offensive cycle going so that they constantly feel some type of threat, some type of pressure. And again, that's why we want to be on top because we can force them to respond. The bottom guy has a lot of trouble forcing the top guy to do anything. So really that's why I believe it is better in all situations to be on top because we can force the bottom guy to fatigue. This would be another situation where if we lock a body lock, we can't step over. Maybe we are nowhere near stepping over. We can unlock our hands to force some action but we need to do it in such a way that we don't get triangled. So I've got Tyler in a body lock here. And you'll see this a ton in early days when people are practicing the body lock pass. They get here, they're like, I've got the first part of the move but I just cannot force anything to happen here. And maybe they did feel like it was okay to open their hands at one stage and they go to put their hands here to push the knee down. They're like, oh my elbow is not enough. They'll go to push the hand down and the bottom guy will strip that grip and that will shoot a triangle here. So that can be super super frustrating right? So if we're here and maybe we have super strong legs here, we cannot get this to retract. We don't want to use our hands on top like this. Even if we're using our elbows still to cover it because Tyler still can find that thumb line there pretty good and start to strip that grip. So if I want to open my hands, I want to keep my hand inside here. Tyler's trying to strip this grip way way tighter and less risky than in this direction here. He can strip that quite easy. So if we want to stay low here and open our hands to pass, bring our hand back. Obviously as well, that long arm is still long. So when I open my hands I'm still keeping hip connection. I'm still keeping shoulder to ear connection as well here. But we cover it in this direction here. So we really create a tight wedge and Tyler tries to strip this grip. Very very difficult and it allows us to step over. The only time I would recommend placing your hands over the top in such a risky way is if we can send our head high right? So I would never be here and here. This is really really dangerous right? If I'm going to open my hands I'm going to bring my head up. Now way harder for Tyler to start threatening triangle chips here right? Again this is a good principle as well when you're trying to body lock if we're dealing with any sort of guys. It's very good with these leg attacks to set up submissions from your body lock. Especially if you're obviously opening your hands. Opening the hands will increase your risk but there are ways to mitigate that danger. Again one of them would be to open your hands and keep the leg covered with your elbow outside rather than inside or on top. Always going to be safer. But some things to think about is a common danger when we open our hands or really if we're just doing this in such poor position that the leg we're trying to trap can come out. So what do I mean by that? If I'm in this position, if I'm in the body lock here and I'm sloppy with this internal ring and Tyler gets that leg out, he can start attacking things like rubber guard, omoplata and stuff. Obviously super super annoying in that sense. What we've got to do and it's the same way we defended the triangle by bringing our head up is obviously if I was in Tyler's close guard, my hands were low and on the floor. Look how easy it is for Tyler to start getting rubber guard attacks here. Obviously the lower my head is, the easier this motion is. So again I have to mention this because it would be a very painful thing emotionally and physically to be submitted at a rubber guard out of a body lock especially obviously with a guy with a low hook as well. So if I ever sense any danger that that foot slips out and Tyler starts setting up rubber guard, I've got to bring my head higher immediately. You see how hard it is for Tyler to attack. Then this would be one of those situations where I can be a bit more reckless with this hand position because again for Tyler to shoot a triangle here, it's going to be pretty damn hard. So if you ever feel someone that has good threats with a rubber guard, we need to bring that head to head pressure. I mean it would be the same as if I was actually just in the rubber guard to begin with. Tyler puts me in the rubber guard, obviously I don't want to be backing up. I don't want to be trying to pull out. That's exactly what Tyler wants. But if Tyler has me in the rubber guard and I'm bringing my head forward, now Tyler's attacks are going to be much, much harder to secure. So it would be the same when we're in the body lock. If I know Tyler has a very dangerous rubber guard, even just on my platy style game, and Tyler clears that leg, I bring my head up. I bring that head to head pressure and again we can open our hands to start stepping over. But I want you to think of it largely the same way. If we do want to open our hands, we can do it super safe where we're covering their leg with elbow outside, hand inside rather than here. But if we are going to open our hands in a more reckless sort of manner, I'm going to do it in such a way that my head comes forward. So even if Tyler were to try to attack the wrist here and clear it, he's in a much worse position here than here. Now we can start setting up those upper body submissions. So again, just some things to think about is don't be just caught in a rut of, it's a body lock pass. I cannot open my hands until we pass half guard. A lot of people think that way. They think, oh, if we open our hands, we're going to get triangle. So I want you to keep it in perspective. If you open your hands and you want to stay low, that really is the danger zone. So keep elbow covered outside, wrist inside, and really cover with the entire wrist, not just the hand. If you are going to take a more reckless approach, which obviously would be just the hand, we need to bring head to head the first sign of danger. Head to head mitigates a lot of those attacks. And really that concept builds into dealing with people with good rubber guards out of the position. Think of it, think of your positioning based on if you were in rubber guard and what they would want. If I was in Tyler's rubber guard and I'm bunkered low by the hips here, I'm giving him everything he wants for all his attacks. And then to combine threatening to pull out at the first sign of danger, we're really helping him more and more again. I think guys pulling out of rubber guard is one of the best set ups for things like the dead orchard. So think about if they're good at rubber guard, where can we put ourselves prior to them establishing it if you sense some danger there. And again, that would be head to head forward pressure. And again, if you get that head to head forward pressure and Tyler's committed to someone like the rubber guard because we're head to head, now we can open our hands and push the leg in such a safe way. So don't stay locked in with the body lock at all costs. Worst thing obviously to happen in your role is you secure the body lock a bunch of times and minutes go by where the bottom guy is just surviving. He feels like he's close to past danger and he feels like it's up to you to take the next step. And because you're in a body lock, you feel like you're winning and you think, oh, what's up to him to take the next step? One of you guys is going to have to take some risk here. And I firmly believe that if you're closer to wherever you need to be, the onus is on you to keep applying that pressure because even a failed body lock pass that made them explode, it still made them explode, still made them overreact. So I think don't be afraid to open your hands and keep the forward pressure. Just play around with your head positioning and your hand coverage to ensure that you don't get submitted when you do open your hands. First address shin on shin. Obviously again, we're dealing with standing versus seated and we're in that mid-range. So in the mid-range here where we can both mutually take grips. So no matter how disciplined you are, at some point, they're going to be able to reach and start looking to establish shin on shin. So this first section we'll talk about, obviously we have a preventative hand fight and we should be covering their hands. Whoever's covering whose hands is winning that hand fight because they have nothing in the way of their direction towards grips. But first of all, let's look at how Tyler would reach the shin on shin. If he's got good defensive positioning, it should be tough for us to get under hooks here, right? Like everything's hidden. But he has to at some point look to reach to grab the knee and place then that shin on shin leg inside. So you can see there is an opportunity every time someone reaches. That goes for everything we've done so far. So if I know they're persisting with shin on shin, I'll try to keep my hands around the knee. So I try to keep my hands here and they're reaching for an outside grip so we can start to look to intercept with an inside grip. Let's take a look at this angle here. So obviously if my hand's out here and he takes a shin on shin grip, now it's going to be hard for me to secure an under hook in any meaningful way. But if we go back a couple of steps, as he reaches, it's always to the outside and we can start looking to take that under hook grip. Now even if he gets shin on shin, no matter what he tries to do with it at this position, it's going to be very difficult. Obviously, you could potentially have front head attacks here. We can obviously still cut through the knee cuts over the top. But basically if we can prevent a meaningful shin on shin grip here, because we're dominating basically inside space here, as he reaches, we can start securing the under hook here. Again, great option would be front head because Tyler does feel risky. He's probably going to look to start making some big erratic movements at this point. Again, super simple idea, super simple technique. But again, we are winning inside position. The only way he's going to grip is he's going to grip outside to place an inside shin hook. So as long as we keep it inside, we're going to be dominating this inside space here. So just something else to keep him guessing as they reach and we basically punish him for taking those reaches here. So it's just a little secret to help you with the hand fighting situation. Let's look at a slightly later stage of shin on shin. So we're covering our knee, they still establish grips, they set up the instep there. So really the key battle when someone has an instep is everything Tyler wants to do is going to be leaning towards the non shin on shin leg. He wants to fall inside my legs. So obviously to counter that, we just need to try to get him to fall to the wrong hip. And as we do that, we can lead into a position that really leads into some good float passing options. So we'll take a look at it from Tyler's position here. So again, Tyler gets this shin on shin. No matter how he wants to elevate here, again, everything involves Tyler falling towards that inside. Whether it's him catching my leg with his secondary leg and pulling myself in. Whether it's him doing that traditional Marcelo Garcia internal rotation. Again, we just recognize that everything revolves around him moving internally here. So when Tyler grabs my leg, I want to pull my secondary leg away and sort of square up with him. So where he wants to fall in between my legs, we're taking that space further away. You can even see Tyler's falling towards the inside. As we touch the back step, he starts to square up a little bit here. Again, we've got to be careful. Obviously, I'm completely out of position if he were to find a means to come up and shoot or something here or really stretch me out and kick me. But again, we want to square him up and then I want to pull. I'm going to pull his head so he falls to that outside here. Just circle. And I've landed here. But Tyler still has his shin on shin. I'm still framing and trying to keep head high here. Obviously, I don't want to fall over. He just comes on top. So I'm still landing with good frames here. I've got my knee above sort of in his hip pocket here, but he still has the shin on shin. He's still got tension there. So I'm going to use my secondary foot to kick that foot off and pummel my leg inside. And a little secret here is don't just reclaim the inside space. Kell your foot around their leg because what that does, it makes it harder for Tyler to put his left toes on the ground. You see I've created tension with some form of crab style hook on his left leg. If I'm relaxed here, he puts those toes back on the ground, you can see he starts having much more mobility here. So when I pummel inside, I hook and catch it. So this really, again, limits his mobility. And we're in a good position now to start using that spare leg, that secondary leg. So I bring my hips forward to place my own shin on shin. He had shin on shin, now we're taking our own shin on shin. But if you keep your hips low here, you'll never ever catch that foot. So you might be afraid to come forwards here, but really as long as our hands are planted and we maintain this head height, Tyler, there's no way he's going to sweep you forward. I'm not jeopardizing myself by moving forward. All I'm doing is placing myself in a position that this pummel is easier to catch. Once we catch this pummel, I can lift my hips and extend that leg through. Tyler's still pretty jammed here. Wherever he goes, we're sort of controlling both his legs. Obviously we wouldn't stay here forever, but we can stay here long enough to now start thinking about pummeling our feet over the top, getting both legs to the same side. So Tyler's trying to move here. Obviously he's conceding passing positions here. He has no good options at this point, right? We just back him into a corner until the only option is really a concession. At some point he goes, I'll concede so I still have some sort of great frame defensive position from the bad position. If he never concedes, ultimately when we pass, we're going to land very close to a submission. At some point he has to decide, all right, I've lost this battle. Let me at least have good frames in when we take a dominant position. So the more intelligent the grappler, the sooner they'll be able to recognize when a battle is lost and already start preparing themselves for the follow-up battle. If you wait too long and fight everything to the bitter end, chances are your guy gets passed and you get submitted straight away. So again, Tyler's locking up that shin on shin. I square him up here and I drive my knee down this hip line here. So we square him up and I really commit full body weight and post my hands on the ground. So again, it's going to take some form of an athletic movement to drive them onto this hip. Change angle here. So Tyler's landed in this position. Basically he has a butterfly hook and he still has a shin on shin. We're going to clear that shin on shin by using our second foot to kick off. And again, when we kick off and get inside, I'm taking a crap style hook. If it's relaxed, Tyler can put his foot on the ground and foot on the ground is the first part of the process to developing movement and some form of athletic sort of ability or explosion there. So we want to take a hook inside here and I rotate my knee inside. Now we're going to use our movement, our body movement to come up. So I bring my hips over Tyler's head so I can pummel my foot inside. If we stay down here, we're never going to get that foot inside. Obviously we have good options here. If Tyler was lazy, we could start developing cross face under pressure, but really you see he's doing an intelligent cross frame here. Chances are I'm not going to get those grips. So I'm going to lift my hips high, pummel my own instep in and now Tyler's really, there's no good choice for him here. I can extend that straight. Again, we're not going to hold him here forever, but we're going to be able to pass off. Sometimes I'll try to pass straight to knee right, but really to keep in theme with what we're doing with this instructional, I like to pass and just ride those legs here. So again, we've put him in a position where we can't, we're not scoring, but he has a lot of trouble moving, a lot of panic. Again, he's expecting this and he's been here a million times. For a guy like Tyler, Tyler spends 99% of every row in bad positions. So really a guy like Tyler, we want to put him in an unfamiliar bad position here. So again, when my leg right in here, Tyler, his lower half is carrying my entire weight. So he has to create athletic explosive movements to start really figuring a way out of it. And that's when we can start taking these unique positions and start obviously score at a point in which he's more fatigued or progress to even better positions. So one more time, Tyler grabs shin on shin, I square up, I commit him to the ground, we pummel our foot inside, we throw that crab hook, I lift my hips high, they come over the head to catch that leg. Again we could go straight to a point scoring position, but why not just stay on the legs, start riding these legs, trap them together or split them and make them basically have forced errors, make bad decisions, ultimately lend us to a position that's closer to a submission when we get to a good position than just getting to a good position and having to battle a fresh opponent. Let's talk about forcing a position, sit up guard. Sit up guard, I'm not going to say it doesn't work in Nogi, I never really say anything doesn't work because I think anything with the sort of, again the unfamiliarity can find effectiveness just because people aren't quite equipped to deal with it. I think that's why most experienced long term grapplers have seen the trends come and go so when a trend re-emerges they're comfortable in that position still but sometimes you can catch younger, highly specialized guys, put them in unfamiliar positions and cause them a lot of issues. Sit up guard, incredible in Nogi, obviously Lucas Lepre in Nogi has an amazing sit up guard but obviously again he has the lapels to play around with and I think in Nogi it is not only more difficult but it is also riskier. I want to show you how basically we can force this position and again this has been an answer to sit up guard for at least 5-6 years because again we talk about seated guard being a battle for inside position. So if Tyler is trying to reach the shin on shin he's taking a form of inside position but if I'm approaching Tyler's guard and I can step inside, obviously this is me now dominating inside position and it's not really obviously what he wanted. Quite often some guys that are really good at shin on shin, if we step inside they'll just lay flat on their back and now they'll play from supine. So don't be surprised if that's a response you get but again if Tyler is looking for inside position it would make sense that our counter to this would be to take an inside position of our own. So when we're dancing around Tyler's going to slide back a bit. So when Tyler's trying to approach us here he has to leave space at some point unless he has a third limb he needs, which I don't know him that intimately but I've been told it's not that big, but he has to provide some space in terms of movement. If he's still he can really protect this inside position here but again if he wants to come forward at all he has to open it up and we can start stepping inside. And again if this is done incorrectly, I am basically giving Tyler a single leg here, it's quite an effective way to come up and start engaging. But again if we get that inside position here, Tyler is vulnerable to submissions and this was very very popular for a long time. I'm going to show this as an option, it's just something to keep them guessing. I wouldn't make this the cornerstone of your game because these will be diving submissions and obviously if you miss those you risk giving up bottom position. The guy on bottom has an excellent guard and even better passing but he has poor takedowns and sweeps so that's a guy that we really don't want to give him any ability to get on top unless we absolutely have to. So we can actually hit a Kimura trap with both arms here. Everyone knows we can hit a Kimura trap on the faca and start looking up but again we also have the ability to go for the wrist around the leg. We just need to commit to it. So we step in and I can roll over Tyler's head so I can take over both directions here. So again Tyler's back. He's keeping disciplined footwork here, it's not available to me. As he starts to move we can come in and give him a little knee to the head as well here. So when I dive for the Kimura trap I emphasize finding that underarm there and then we reach for the wrist here and obviously I'm not going to go into great detail but you have a ton of options here. If Tyler sits up I can get my knee in the pocket, take my leg over the thigh here, I can lift his hips with that to get both hooks and now we have the back grab. So when we're in this position here if I can hit down and get my knee under his armpit here, throw my other leg on his head I can now bridge heavily towards the sky and create action for the arm bar by rotating my knee under the armpit. Obviously we have our triangle options to do. We've landed the Kimura trap, we've come over the top, we've caught the leg, we can go belly down, scoop up this leg nice and good, bring our hips back underneath, start looking up triangles and reinforcing. Again we have the Kimura trap, we can start coming over and thinking about attacking Tarika as well. So again we have a ton of options out of these positions. So I won't go into great detail, I cover a lot of the triangles in this systematic submission dilemmas, there's a ton of triangle formation there. The Kimura trap really mainly is a path to the back. Again the idea we're trying to work here is as Tyler moves he has to leave some space and again I'm going to stay heavy on his upper body here. If I'm applying pressure to him he has to carry that weight and really if I don't have weight on him here he doesn't even need that arm on the ground. But if I put weight on him here he doesn't want to go down, now he has to post and that's how we can find the wrist here. But don't forget we can go both sides here. So I can make him think I'm looking for that one, we can catch and roll through as well. But again that won't be our only option from here, if I can come inside I also can grab chin straps, force him back, roll down and now we have a ton of front headlock game here. So I can start to lift my legs, catch the arm, start attacking submissions, Tyler tries to roll on top. Again if he rolls that way he's coming straight into a guillotine, if he rolls the other way we can pendulum, keep our head higher and start catching submissions. I don't want you to think about this as a perfect guide to how to do these submissions because again it doesn't fit in entirely to what we're working with right? Because we want to find positions where we can apply consistent pressure over time, breaking down our opponents so when we get to good positions they're fatigued and we will submit them easily. These are high risk moves but also something you need to know, you need to throw it in there, you need to keep them guessing right? Every now and then we're going for plan A, applying pressure, applying pressure, applying pressure, they give us something obvious like this, we take it, being cautious that we are taking a big risk here, they could end up on top. So really to avoid being swept out of these if you miss them, just have the awareness to not commit so hard that if it doesn't go well you can't get back up. So you've got a Kimura, a Kimura trap is an old technique, it's very modern looking but people have been dealing with it for a long time. So I want you to remember that this particular Kimura trap and this setup won't be anything new but again if you're used to getting the right opponent and you're happy to take a concession if it's not working and you get back on top, throw it in there every now and then, they're going to have to change part of the way they play. If I'm passing a guy with a terrible seated wrestling game but every now and then he still tries it because he's working that part of his game, I have to respect it. Even if I know he's not going to get that double leg off of his butt, I still have to keep certain parts of my game tight and disciplined to rule that out. So again you don't always need to be going for the things you're good at, you just need to keep them guessing and this will be one of those options. But if someone just believes, oh he's only going to return me to Supine and try to bodylock Onika and occasionally throws that in, again it's just keeping people unfamiliar with your intentions. So again we're not going into great detail about those submissions, those submissions are out there in other instructions I've covered but I just want you to know that if we win inside position against a guy only fighting for inside position, they might return to Supine or if they hang out there, we have submission opportunities available to us. So we've covered briefly when we were talking about outside passing, how we can step into the hip pocket and how it's basically the position you'd end up in if you high stepped or back stepped out of Ashi. So we covered our options from that position but we're just going to refresh it because I put the idea in your head that you can put yourself in that position and do these moves out of there but I also want you to remember that if they get Ashi and you high step out, we are in the same position. I just want you to make sure you're familiar that those options are present in both situations. There's nothing unique about high stepping out of an Ashi, finding yourself in that spot and if you put yourself in that spot having bypassed the Ashi altogether, everything is going to be exactly the same. So let's say, again this sort of fits, we did early stage Shin on Shin, we did a middle stage and now we're sort of ultimately late stage. Late stage is the end result really. So we've ended up in Ashi, get some Shin on Shin and we land in this position. So what we want to do is get our hips in front so we can push this foot forward to capture around sort of the toe knuckle here. But again, when we land in Ashi, I want you to settle your balance for a second. Quite often, people that are poor at entering Ashi, you maintain your balance the whole time. People that are very good at entering this position, you land here out of balance. So option one should always be like, correct your balance and then progress. If you think escape this position immediately and it's a very experienced guy, a good example would be one way to enter this position is if Tyler uses his secondary leg to stretch me out. So obviously if I immediately went for the counter, I might get off balance. So just remember that, collect your balance first like we're trying to surf here so we get our stability. In any guard, we stabilize ourselves, then we progress. So we've landed here, I want to get this foot so I pop my hips forward to catch it and now I'm going to use both legs. Tyler's strength here, his hips are off the ground. When his hips are off the ground, I'm carrying more of his weight. He's more attached to me. When we leave this position here, now he's really not attached to me in any way. Maybe in Achilles, he's still keeping that Achilles look, right? But we have to use both legs, right? I want you to knock both legs off so we're holding this leg down. Because worst case scenario is his hips drop down and this foot bumps me forward. And then he has access to a range of things. The simplest being he could just grab my second leg. He could switch Achilles, he could use it to knock me back, right? So when we clear this, I want you to control both ankles. We're going to bring our left foot to our butt and we're going to rotate to face the legs. So again, we cleared it. Don't just try to step through. Bring that foot to your butt in any way you can. So we just need to make sure that it doesn't catch either leg along the way and again, that he doesn't grab it. So if we're in this position here, I clear both legs, I'm holding his hips on the ground and I bring that foot to my butt and immediately control the legs. Obviously, if he's not holding onto my right leg still, I would just step to the shoulder line there. But if he keeps that Achilles grip tight, now we're going to have that ability and he's going to try to retain that. He's going to try to bring his knee back in. He's going to try to bring his left knee inside, right? Now he's got a frame here. So we anticipate that response to get the guard back right. So if he can bring this knee inside, he has some form of defensive posture. So as he goes to bring it in, bring both legs past. So we're holding him here, he's resisting, he's bringing that knee in and we can clear away. And again, now we keep it in that sort of, we put him in a defensive cycle. We've created an angle here. He tries to recover. You can keep holding this leg, put it aside, start creating stacks. But again, the second you clear it, keep moving, keep applying pressure to that. They're perfectly comfortable here. We clear it. They're less comfortable, but not too concerned. We get here. Now they're starting to get really, really worried, right? But again, he's still not too disconfident here because generally speaking, passes occur over a range of sequences against guys with good guards. So we've done one movement here. When Tyler starts to get really worried is when he starts to defend and we're still keeping him out of range. Now another leg comes in, he tries to pull back to guard and we're keeping him, we're getting deeper and deeper. Now he tries to bring his guard back in, we create a stack. Each time he makes a big movement to try to retain guard and it doesn't happen, usually he's going to start to stress more and more and more, especially if I'm not just staying at the same distance. Every time he tries to recover, I see it coming, get a little deeper. With that keeps happening, he really starts to panic. And when he starts to panic, he starts to make big movements. When he starts to make big explosive movements, he starts to get tired. So again, everything is a combination to pass the guard, right? We get our balance, we clear it, foot to butt, face to leg, leg comes back in, we're not stopping, we've created a cycle here. We keep pressuring him. So don't get to this point, he gets his guard back and we go, alright, now we need to go through it again. The more you keep him moving from here, the better. Obviously we've got that hip pocket, he brings the other leg in, keep pressuring him, keep pressuring him, applying forward movement, Tyler's trying to move here. So don't let up for a minute, just keep applying pressure. So we put ourselves in the Ashi pocket without having entered Ashi, we did those things. So if we're in Ashi, do the same thing. It's nothing different. Clear Ashi and think I've escaped his guard, now I'm going to figure out a way to pass his guard, use the escape to create the offensive loop and just keep hammering away and watch them fatigue and ultimately crumble from that position.
