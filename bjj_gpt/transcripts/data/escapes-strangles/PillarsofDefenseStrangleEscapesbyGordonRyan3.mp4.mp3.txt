 All right, so now we're going to look at going into Yoko Senkaku, the side triangle. Now this is a move that you hardly ever see utilized in Jiu Jitsu. You see wrestlers use it sometimes for front headlock and they use it to turn guys around and pin them. You see it a lot in Judo where guys end up in Yoko Senkaku for submissions. But it's very underutilized in Jiu Jitsu. It's very effective, especially when coupled with a topside control, Kimura from a dorsal Kimura, and then you feel like you can't separate the hands and you use Yoko Senkaku to play a dilemma game between the strangle and finishing the Kimura. Again, a very hard triangle to deal with because bridges have no effect really. For the most part, you can't bridge out of it. You can turn on top, but you can't really bridge and move your partner around as you want to. And you can't step over because you're in this awkward position where you're perpendicular to your partner and you're facing belly up and they're facing belly down. It's a very difficult triangle to deal with. So we're going to go into some initial defenses from a top pin where my partner has the pinned and topside control, has a Kimura locked, and then is trying to lock Yoko Senkaku and they can't separate my hands. And then go into Kimura defenses off of that because there is a Kimura and strangle danger. And then we'll go into defending the strangle, escaping the strangle, the endgame, and then transitioning to a reverse triangle off of that Yoko Senkaku. This is very similar to a closed guard scenario. This is a bunch of different setups, but I think the most common one for Yoko Senkaku, especially in Jiu Jitsu, is going to be a dorsal Kimura where my partner has a Kimura from a top pin. She sets a Kimura up, however it may be. And from here, she can't separate my hands and she's having a hard time separating my hands. And that if she can't separate my hands and she's any good, the next step is always going to be Yoko Senkaku. So whenever I see my partner looking to make a weightless right leg and look to put her heel between my elbow and my ribcage, you know from here Yoko Senkaku is coming. So the first thing I want to do is I want to make sure that my partner's leg is out here somewhere, she's down on her knee, so I tuck my elbow in to my own body like so. So when she goes to expose that inside position with her heel, it's a difficult thing to do. Okay? Now, if I'm a little bit late and she gets her hand inside, or she gets her foot inside, the second it comes inside I immediately pommel my hand to the inside and now I look to start taking my hands inside. So if she does fall to Yoko Senkaku, I can use that connected hand position to start to separate her legs and bring my legs out and start to either trap her legs or wedge her legs in place and then go into early escapes from there. So just recognizing danger from this position, when she has that dorsal Kimura and she can't separate hands, you know Yoko Senkaku is coming. So I want to beat her ability to get her heel inside, and if I can't do that, the second she goes to throw that heel inside, I immediately take my hand to the inside position. Okay? Now, as my hand comes to the inside position, what I can't have is a situation where I unlock my hands and she just quickly rips the Kimura behind my back. So if I'm going to take my hand to the inside, I bring my leg up. So when she goes to put the Kimura behind my back, this will be a delaying tactic. Eventually she's going to do it because my hands are open, but when she goes to rip it behind the back, I take my hand to the inside. The leg wedges me in place for a second and then I relock my hands. And now she can't quite fall to Yoko Senkaku and she's pretty much either doomed to falling to Yoko Senkaku to try it, or she has to take her leg out completely because if she leaves her leg back where it is, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start pushing legs down and now I can start trapping legs in position where I can start wedging her legs in place. I can start off balancing her, making her post hands, and now there's back exposure for her and it all kind of falls apart from here. Okay? So these are some of your very early escapes when you're not in Yoko Senkaku, but just recognizing the danger and recognizing the setups and the positions that your partner is going to try to fall into Yoko Senkaku from. All right, so let's look at my situation where my partner falls to a Yoko Senkaku and just has the legs locked with an initial trap triangle. The ankles are crossed, the legs aren't completely figure forward, or they aren't figure forward in a way where they can actually submit you, but apply strangling pressure. So we're in here, my partner falls to Yoko Senkaku and pulls me up on top of her, like so, and she just has a cross of the legs. So the legs are just crossed and she has everything in a situation where it's getting kind of hairy now, but I'm not 100% in danger. Whenever I see this, first thing I'm going to look to do from here is I'm going to look to snake my hand to the inside. Okay? Now, I can't unlock my hands and just have my partner rip my hand out and put it down on the floor and then switch her legs and go to Kimura. Every time I go to unlock my hand, I take my leg up. Now I just take my hand to the inside here and I just start getting a few small bridges. Right now there's a bend in my wrist so I can't get my hand in there. I just get bridge, one, two, three, four, and I just snake my hand to the inside. Okay? Once my hand's on the inside, lock your legs. Once my hand is on the inside here, now we can go and we can relock our legs. And we can use that, or relock our hands rather. We can use that lock of the hands, even if it's a ten finger grip, to start bridging and as I bridge, I lift my hands over the head and I use my heels to bridge and pull myself down. So when she goes to lock up, one, two, three, four. And I use that to clear my head out and now I end up in Tiki Mura instead of Yoko Senkaku. Okay? So, she falls in, she locks up. Now it's going to be hard from here to start getting my hand to the inside position. Right? So what I'm going to attempt to do first is I'm going to bridge. One, two, three, four. And I'm going to try to get my hand to the inside. A lot of times as she's falling, we can pommel the hand in. So I go back. A lot of times she steps in, my hands are locked. As she goes to fall, I just pommel my hand to the inside and now our hands are locked. Now right from here, as my hands are locked, I start lifting the hands over the head as I start bridging and pulling my body down. One, two, three, four. And that clears the head out and away. And there's always going to be times from here where your partner locks up the legs, you try to bridge and bring your hand inside and the knees are pinched so close together that you just can't get your hand inside. Okay? Whenever I see this, you're probably a little bit too late to do this escape where your hand comes inside. So whenever I see this from here, I'm going to bring my elbow forward and I'm going to give a bridge and I'm going to look to start catching my partner's heel. Okay? If for whatever reason you feel like you're having a hard time doing this and your partner's following you with the knees, we just go in and we just catch our partner's leg quickly. So that our one leg stays up so if at any point she breaks the grip, it runs into my leg and then we just catch the leg. Give him a lock. And I just catch my partner's heel like so. Now that I have my partner's heel caught, we can start to go in and disrupt the lock of our partner's legs. So I just catch my partner's heel and I have weight on one leg and I have my elbow catching the other heel. Once she gets the lock up tight, it's a pretty easy thing to just separate my partner's legs. And now we go in and we start disrupting her grip with the legs, with our legs, and we can start going into escapes from here where we can strip the Kimura grip. As we strip the Kimura grip, we bring hands inside and now we're out. Okay? So, and I feel like I can't bring my hand inside. I can reach back and I can get my elbow in place. If for whatever reason that's hard, we just go in and we catch our partner's leg like so. Okay? And then from here, you'll find that trying to sit up first, like so, your partner has locked your legs, partner has locked the legs, and now from here a big whip will make it easy to get my hand in position. Okay? Now, once my hand's in position, I have weight over the legs, she goes to keep her legs locked. We just take our hand straight towards the ceiling and that will unlock the legs. From this position, it's a pretty easy thing now to keep our legs up and then look to go in and trap our partner's leg in various ways. So, a lot of times from here, she has her legs locked and whether I fall and I can't get my hand inside as we're falling, I can't bridge and get my hand inside, no problem. I look to start sitting up and looking to create this rocking motion where I can reach back and catch my partner's heel like so. If for whatever reason, I feel like that's not working and she's following me with the motion from here, no problem. We just go in and we quickly transfer from the leg to her leg. And now, as we play with that rocking motion or we just pull the knee towards us, she goes to follow me with the knees now. That's a pretty easy thing to go in and catch my partner's leg. From this position, she goes to keep her legs locked nice and tight. We just go in, we just extend everything out. And now we go in, we bring the legs inside, and we're ready to go in and start escaping from here. Okay? So, these are your basic early escapes. Either we take a hand inside like so as she's falling or after she falls and the knees are open, locked up. And from here, we can start clearing the head or if we feel like we can't do that, we can go in and we can start reaching to catch. We can grab our partner's leg and start reaching to catch. And now from here, when she goes to lock up, it's a pretty easy thing to separate those legs. Lock them, clear the kimura, and start rolling in to all of our escapes, back takes, leg entanglements, things like that. All right, so this one's risky, but it does get your head out of the equation. There's no more yoko senkaku, so they just have control over the arm, not the head and the arm, but you're in a kimura. So this is risky, but it can get you out. So this time, we're in yoko senkaku. And this time, I'm not going to have my hands locked. If my hands are unlocked, my partner can put my hand on the floor, assuming this leg isn't high. And even if the leg is high, eventually she can get my hand to the floor. My hands aren't locked, she can always put the hand on the floor. If my hands are locked, she can always collect the far triceps and start pulling it in and get into a full yoko senkaku. So a lot of times what I do from here is I, let's say, for whatever reason, you can't separate the legs, maybe there's a full triangle lock or close to a full triangle lock, and I feel like I just can't get control of my partner, see, I can't separate the legs, and I'm just either being stalled out here or I want to start moving. Whatever the case is, I can't escape the position. Whenever I see this, I just relax my left arm and I put my leg down. So that now from here, my partner scissors the legs and she puts my hand on the floor and starts to attack kimura. So she unlocks her legs, she switches her hips, she comes up and she moves into this position here. From this position, I have the inside elbow position now, and now my head is no longer trapped. But my hand is behind my back. This is not a good sign. You have to act quickly from here because you're seconds away from getting broken with the kimura. Immediately from this position, I immediately swish my legs out to the side and I catch my partner's ankle with my leg. Whether you do it with an ankle or whether you reach down and you physically grab your partner's ankle, it doesn't matter. Anything you need to do to get to this ankle is what we need from here. And now we hit a strong back heel and we put a bend in our partner's leg. When she goes to break me from this position, my next thing is to get to this leg. And as I start pointing my left knee out across the body, you can always access this leg pretty easily from here. When she goes to break me from this position, I can always roll my partner through. My hand might still be behind the back, but now she has no control over me from here. So what will happen is, let's rotate. What will happen is, I'll roll my partner through, I'll get up, as I get up, so I control the hands behind the back, she'll put the hand behind the back and roll me through a second time. And now from here, we end up in T-Kimura, where there's no control over the head anymore, and now we can fight to get out of the T-Kimura. So we can beat Kimura, as she goes to come up on top, we fight out of the Kimura quickly because we are a second away from getting broken. We roll on top, she puts the hand behind the back, we roll again, and now we've moved into a T-Kimura instead of a fully locked Yoko Senkaku. This time, we're in Yoko Senkaku, and if I don't want the Kimura, I either lock my hands or at bare minimum, have my knee up high. This time I want to beat the Kimura, so I put my legs down and I let her put my hand on the floor. Now, the second she goes to scissor the legs, if she scissors the legs, and my elbow gets caught on the outside position, you're going to get broken here, believe me. I make sure my elbow comes to the inside of my partner's knee, and I quickly swish my legs up and over to the outside. I catch my partner's ankle like so, and now from here, I just lever my left knee out and across the body. This will always present my partner's opposite leg towards me, in which case we can roll our partner through like so. She will usually stay in the Kimura because it's so deep, she's so invested in getting that finish. From this position, I've got to get up. As I've got to get up, if the hand comes in front of the body, great, but it's so far behind the back, it probably won't. You monitor your partner's leg, she goes to roll you through, you roll through a second time, and now from here, we're in position, ready to start stripping Tiki Muras and going into the fences right off of this. A little bit faster, one more time. Try from this angle. She comes up with Kimura. As she does so, we go in here. Now she has to start breaking me. We go in, and now from here, as I go to start passing, I can't because of the pressure of the Kimura. We roll through a second time. Now we're in Tiki Mura, ready to go in, start stripping, and go into all of our defenses from there. So risky, but you're already in a fully locked triangle. If you want to, you can bait Kimura, you can relinquish, so your partner relinquishes the head control, and then you can fight out of Kimura from there. Come up on top and either stay on top, strip the Kimura grip, or be forced to roll through again and then into Tiki Mura, where you can now defend. There's an obvious Kimura strangle dilemma here. So one thing we can do is we can bait our partner, not bait our partner, but we can give them the forearm. So we can defend the Kimura by locking our hands. When we lock our hands, we will always count on our partner reaching towards the far elbow, gathering it, and then making an adjustment to go into Yoko Senkaku. Now in order for her to make an adjustment to actually go into a Yoko Senkaku from here, she has to unlock her legs and turn belly down. The split second where she goes to unlock her legs, I use that to start turning towards her. The second she grabs my elbow, I give it to her and I anticipate her going to unlock the legs to adjust the strangle. The second I see this, when she goes to start turning belly down, I just start turning towards her. I look towards my partner, and now I just give a quick bridge. Now I'm not overly explosive or anything. I just give a quick bridge. I turn up on top of my partner like so. Now when she goes to lock the triangle, the angle is wrong. We change positions now. And now it's the easiest thing in the world. If she has Kimura still, she can't lock Kimura from here, it's a pretty easy thing to start shearing the elbow off with my knee. Lock up tight. It's a pretty easy thing to start shearing the elbow off with my knee. And then from here, I just go into a four point. Whether I start coming up like so, lock up. Whether I start coming all the way up into a four point and shake, shake, shaking, until she comes up, or from here I can even start doing things like taking reversely on belly positions. Then now from here, when she goes to lock up, I just shake, shake, shake, and we're out and away. So we can give the far arm, we can anticipate that switch to a tight strangle, and then we can roll up on top of our partner and defend relatively easily. So we give the far arm, and we anticipate this turn, which will always force your partner to unlock the legs and adjust. As this happens, we turn towards our partner. We deal with the Kimura first by shearing it with the knee. And now when she goes to lock, I either one, go into a situation where I move into a referee position, or two, if it's tight, I feel like it's still tight, I go into a full four point. And at three point, I start thumb posting on my partner's legs, my partner's hips, anything which will create distance. The thigh is fine, the hips are fine, both are good. Or three, I start walking around to the same side as my trapped arm, and we just go in, and we go reverse in the umbella. And she gets to move me around from here, pretty easy thing, starts slipping out in time, and then you can easily free the head, free the arm, and you're out of Yokosuka. All right, so let's look at two end games here, the Kimura and the strangle. If at any point she goes into the Kimura, and she comes up, and she switches her hips, she gets my hand to the floor, she switches her hips, and she can put her knee inside my armpit, like so, and she can keep the inside knee position relative to my elbow, you're gonna get broken before you can escape from here. It still comes down to time, yes, you theoretically have unlimited time because you can just get broken and keep fighting, but you're gonna get broken. Now when she goes to finish the Kimura, my elbow can't come inside, which means I can't access the legs at all, and now from here, I get broke. The only way I can defend from here is if I have the inside elbow position, where now I can access my partner's ankle and start to give her trouble, and access this leg, so I have to roll my partner over. But if she has the inside knee position, and your hand's behind your back, you're gonna get broke from here. Now with the Yokosuka, if your partner actually does turn belly down, she accesses that tricep, and from here, she actually locks up a full triangle, and I miss, and I don't time the turn right, and now once it's locked, I try to turn, it's too late now. And now from here, when I try to turn on top, I can't do it. When the triangle's locked, I can't do it, and there's not enough time to do anything, and my partner ends up strangling me. So if I feel the triangle's fully locked, and I can't turn on top of my partner, if the triangle is fully locked and I can turn on top of my partner, then you can go into the same defense as we looked at. But it's unlikely if the triangle's fully locked and my partner's legs are connected, it's unlikely I'm gonna be able to turn in towards my partner. And so I can't turn away, I can't sit up, I can't do any of that, I can't back roll, and so this is the endgame here. When I maybe had a timing error, or I didn't anticipate her making the adjustment and unlocking the legs, and now she's got a fully locked triangle, she's belly down, and she has a fully locked strangle. All right, so now we're gonna go into the fifth triangle, which is Gyaku Senkaku, which is almost never used in Jiu Jitsu. The only reason people even know it exists is because it was made famous by Braulio Estima when he submitted to Andre Galvao in a high-profile ATCC match. Now that entry is pretty good as well, but most of the time that I use this Gyaku Senkaku triangle is from when I fail a Yoko Senkaku, someone turns on top, and I make a transition to Gyaku Senkaku. So just going off what we just did with the Yoko Senkaku, we'll make a transition to Gyaku Senkaku off of a failed Yoko Senkaku, and then we have to go into the fences there. So when I have a Yoko Senkaku on someone, and they turn up towards me, I go in, I try to collect the far tricep, she turns towards me, and from here we end up in a situation like so. So if I lock a Yoko Senkaku, there's no strangling pressure whatsoever. But if I make a transition, and I shift my hips, and she comes up to Gyaku Senkaku, now from here we can go in, we can lock the body, and now a different configuration of triangle where we can go in and get strong finishes for the win. So we can use a failed Yoko Senkaku as our partner turns on top of us to switch to a Gyaku Senkaku, and then we can use a Gyaku Senkaku, the reverse triangle, to finish our partners. So this is a pretty uncommon triangle, you don't really see it too much besides the Brawlio Andre match, but it's a great follow-up for when you're trying to go Yoko Senkaku, your partner turns on top before you can really get anything going, and then you switch to the Gyaku Senkaku, they think they're out, and then the reverse triangle comes on, and you finish with that strangle regardless. All right, so early escapes, essentially what we just did for the Yoko Senkaku, it's more about denying the connection of the back of their knee to your neck than anything. So the second I turn on top, the whole thing is to lengthen my arm, to shorten my neck, and to make this space that my head and my arm have to slip out as small as possible, so I can extract my head and my arm at one time through my partner's legs. All right, the wider my elbow is here, the more I'm going to get caught up trying to pull and extract my arm and my head out from inside my partner's triangle. So the early escape for here is, as I'm going to rotate on top of my partner, as she goes to invert that knee, my whole thing is to just shrug my shoulder like so, and elongate my arm. So as she goes to actually form this connection to the side of my neck that she needs here, I'm shrugging my shoulder, and I'm pushing my arm up and forward into my partner's knee. So when she goes to adjust her knee position, it's a difficult thing from here. I have a physical wedge on my partner's knee. Right here, she has a strong connection, she needs to actually finish me. From this position, before she locks it up, I want this, like so. So now when she goes to form that connection, when she has to invert that knee, it's hard. And now from here, I can look to start to make my way out and away. So as she goes to switch from yoko senkaku to gyaku senkaku, I just shoot a wedge underneath and inside my partner's knee. So when she goes to make that connection, it's difficult. And now from here, we just walk back and away, either with a four point, reverse knee on belly, same thing as we did before, and we go into our escapes. But if you know the gyaku senkaku is coming, elbow goes inside and underneath your partner's knee so it can invert and they can't form a connection they need with their back of their knee to the side of your neck to actually create that strangulation pressure that they need. All right, so now my partner actually locks a triangle, it's strangling me. What am I looking to do here? If your partner locks their hands around your hips, it's going to be tough. So the first thing I want to do is I want to try my best to alleviate the pressure by shooting that shoulder forward, the elbow comes inside and underneath my partner's knee, and I want to go right into a four point so it's hard for my partner to actually reach and control my waist. So as I turn on top of my partner, like so, and she goes to make the switch, she's going to be moving to my waist, like so. And now she can actually lock things in place. The second I move up, come back, the second I start moving up to this position, she has Kimura locked. The second I see Kimura's locked, I immediately just pop up to a three point, like so. Now when she goes to make the transition to Gyaku Senkaku, she'll be trying to get to my waist. But when she goes to reach, it's going to be far, she won't be able to actually lock her hands. And now as she goes to make the transition, I wedge my hand up like so, so that my elbow comes inside and underneath my partner's knee. When she goes to make the transition now, it's not going to be impossible, but it's going to be harder to get to my waist. Even if she makes the transition here, I'm going to four point, like so, lock your legs, like so with your hands. So I'm going to four point here, and she goes to lock the waist now, I can put wedges on top of my partner's shoulder. I can put wedges on top of my partner's hip. And now from here, when she goes to actually come forward and lift up and get to the waist, it's difficult. And now from here, we can look to walk out and away, and use a four pointing method to move out and escape from the strangle. So my whole thing is the second I turn up into top position, and I feel like I know I have a good partner here, she knows that if she gets to strangle and she locks the waist, it's going to be real hard for me to go anywhere. So the first thing I do is I just move up and I go right to a four point, okay? Or a three point if I keep looking more. The second I turn up, the second we go in, we're here. Now when she goes to get to my waist, we block her. She goes to get to my waist, we block her. Even if she locks up the strangle, she can't get to my waist. And now, it allows me to keep building height. And she can only form a connection with the legs, but not with the hands, okay? Now we go into an end game where our partner actually gets to the waist. All right, so now let's look at the end game where I have my partner down. Yoko Sankaku fails, she turns on top. As she turns on top, I invert the knee, I get to the waist. Now when she goes to circle in either direction, it means nothing. If she goes to try to go reverse knee on belly, she can't because of the control over my partner's waist. When she goes to try to take a knee between my shoulders, on top of my shoulders and wedge me in place, she can't. And now from here, we just pinch the knees, we backheel, we get strong strangles. Even if she falls all the way over to bottom position, that's fine. We just stay on the waist, we lock up, and now we actually have body weight applied to the gyaku and it's much tighter than it was to begin with, okay? So the end game here is if they have a good connection to your neck with the back of their kneecap and they control your waist with locked hands around the waist, it is going to be exceedingly difficult to escape. You're probably going to get a finish. I don't have any other late defenses because that's just the end of the road for me. But maybe you guys or someone else will figure out some way to escape when the hands are locked around the waist and the strangle's fully in. But for right now, this is the end of the road. Strangle's locked in place, legs are in good position, and they have control of your waist. So you can't forepoint. If you do forepoint, they just bring you up with them. You can't get knees inside, you can't go reverse knee on belly, you can't do anything, and you're completely stuck. Your partner's glued to you from bottom position and you only have a few seconds before the strangle comes on and it comes on tight this one. So that's your endgame for Gyaku Senkaku. All right, so now we're going to start moving into strangle holds with the upper body, with the arms. We're going to do a quick closing segment on leg strangles, triangles. When most people talk about triangles, they talk about front triangles, which is great. It's the most common type of triangle. But understand that there are five distinct triangle groups. And there are many setups and combinations you can use with these triangles. You can move from one triangle to another, as we saw. You can use Kimuras and arm bars and all kinds of different dilemmas with joint locks with these triangles. And you see now that you really have to become a master at attacking these triangles to understand what's going on defensively. So you can't just be good at defense or just be good at offense. You have to be good at both. So we looked at some of the defenses to the setups of these triangles. And then we looked at early escapes and late escapes to these triangles, from when the triangle's not really locked to when you're like, oh man, I'm getting strangled now. So we ran through all five major triangle groups. And now we're going to start moving into front headlocks, guillotines, darsas, anacondas, shichikage tames, and stuff, things like that, and then we'll progress on through there. All right, so now I'm just going to kind of breeze through this. I just wanted to have a little introduction so you know what we're going to be doing. I said in the overview how it would go, but we're going to start with front headlocks. There's a lot of content from front headlocks. There's guillotines, there's different kinds of guillotines, there's darsas, there's anacondas. And we did, of course, front headlock and turtle escapes positionally, but we didn't do any submissions from these positions yet. So now you'll have kind of the full idea of positionally how we defend an escape and how we defend submissions. And then once we finish that, then we'll work through kagetames, north-south strangles, and we'll just progress from front headlock into the next position, into the next positions, and then we'll finish it off, I believe, at north-south strangles. It's the last one, I think. I'm not positive. But let's get into this now. We'll start with front headlocks and then starting with guillotines, and then we'll move through into darsas and anacondas and so forth. All right, so now from front headlock, there are a few different types of guillotines. We have to establish and distinguish which ones are which, because they all have some similarities in their defenses, but they all have different defenses. So there's an arm-in guillotine, where I physically have one of my partner's arms inside the guillotine. So I have a head and an arm trapped, and we go in and we finish with guillotine from here. I have a high elbow guillotine, where I lock up and I physically bring my elbow up and high and over my partner's shoulder, and we have high elbow guillotines. And then we can go in and we can talk about low elbow guillotines, where I have an elbow low below my partner's shoulder, and I'm still strangling her. So we're going to learn how to work out of arm-in guillotines, we're going to learn to work out of high elbow guillotines, and we're going to learn to work out of low elbow guillotines. And typically, arm-in guillotines are the hardest to finish, but also the hardest to escape because of the fact that you're controlling your partner's head and arm. So if you have good finishing mechanics, this is debatably one of the tighter guillotines. Whereas high elbow, you have a massively tight strangle, but your partner has pretty easy defensive reactions where they can just easily reach over, pull the elbow down, convert to a low elbow, and then you can go into a low elbow escape relatively easy compared to an arm-in guillotine because of the fact that there's only the head trapped, and there's not the arm trapped as well. But we're going to work through three guillotines, the arm-in, the high elbow, and the low elbow. So let's just look at some basic theory for guillotines before we go into this any further. And even for anacondas and darses as well. Understand that for almost every guillotine, maybe besides the high elbow just because it's mechanically so tight, but in general for guillotines and darses and anacondas, the strangles will be massively tighter if your opponent can connect their legs and hips to yours in some fashion, whether they can lock a guillotine and throw a shin across your hip and fire a leg up like so, whether they can lock a half guard on you and control your legs like so, whether they can lock a closed guard on you, this is the worst, and control your legs like so, or whether you can lock a guillotine and you can end up mounted, so basically an inverted closed guard, and you can go in and finish like so. Anything where I can wrap my legs into your legs and be relatively hip to hip or hip to hip will drastically increase the finishing pressure on guillotines. Your partner needs a connection of their legs to you and a crunch of your chin to your chest. They can't do those two things, it's going to be extremely hard to finish you. So what we're looking for defensively is to stop ways for our partner to crunch our chin to our chest and to stop our partner from wrapping their legs around us or around our legs and getting hip to hip. This is just some basic theory. All of our defenses we built around trying to stop those two things, stop our partner from getting chin to chest action and stop our partner from wrapping their legs around us whether it be our legs or our hips to some degree. So everything we're going to be doing defensively we built around that and then you'll see the escapes will become much and much harder the more entangled we get inside of our partner's legs eventually leading to a closed guard which is the hardest of all to escape and we have to figure out what we're going to do from there and go into our late escapes once your partner actually has that connection formed. So high elbow guillotine is the tightest guillotine you can be in. You have the ability to get a wrist up nice and deep which gives you the best connection to both sides of the neck and then you have an elbow that comes over the shoulder which makes it hard for your partner to pull the wrist down because you have a wedge over the shoulder which is keeping your hand suspended in the air. A high elbow guillotine is also something that you don't have to have a connection of your hips to your partner's in order to finish. If I lock a high elbow guillotine and even if my partner jumps to side control which you normally would to defend and she falls on top of me she's still going to get finished with the guillotine because it's just so mechanically strong. I know this side I have to go I couldn't move. Yeah sure. I swear to god. Brown belt. I couldn't go on their side of course but I cannot move. But um. Oh my gosh. So you know the lock is just so mechanically tight that it doesn't really matter if the hips are connected to your opponent's. If you do it's just like so devastating that your opponent is instantly tapping. But it's not necessary. So this is going to be a real issue for us going forward and our whole thing with high elbows especially when the legs started to get locked around us is always to convert it to a low elbow guillotine to start giving us ourselves more time to fight out of the lock and then we can start fighting out of the low elbow instead of doing it from a high elbow position. All right so from a front headlock position we have two defensive hands one primary one secondary as we do from the back. We spoke about this before and we're going to look at recognizing the primary dangers and you know the early escapes where we don't even allow our partner to set up a guillotine. So if you're in a front headlock and you want to remain safe from guillotines the whole thing is to have good grip fighting with good primary and secondary hands in place. Where if my partner is in a front headlock I will have she'll have her hands in position like so. Just front headlock. This side or this side? Front headlock. She'll have hands in either like so or she'll have her hands locked and she'll be ready to go in and start fighting into guillotines. So from here I will have one primary hand where my thumb stays inside my partner's wrist here. I will have one secondary hand which stays inside my partner's wrist here. The primary hand will do all the work of stopping both your partner's wrist and elbow from coming across and up towards my neck. So the primary hand does all the work. The secondary hand will stop the wrist from coming up but it won't stop the elbow from coming across and then in turn the wrist coming up. So the secondary hand is a delaying factor. It delays your partner from strangling you but it doesn't stop the hand from getting up high. So the primary hand will do all the work. If the primary hand is stripped the secondary hand will do some of the work provided you're on the rest. Alright? We have our primary hand in and our secondary hand in. Whatever hand is over my shoulder, if she has her locked hands for example or if she's grabbing my tricep, whatever the case is, whatever hand is over my shoulder is the strangle hand. Okay? So whenever I see this strangle hand coming through I always want to make sure that I keep this strangle hand as close to the same side as it's on as possible. The further her strangle hand starts coming through to the opposite side that her hand is on the more chances of her strangling me with guillotines from this front headlock position. So the first thing I want is always just to recognize the danger and I put my primary hand in. Now let's say for whatever reason we end up in a scramble and my partner switches hands where she passes it across and she gets to punch her other hand in. I have to be ready for this. I have to recognize this and I have to put my primary and secondary hand in on the opposite side and be ready to start working from here. Alright? And you have to realize that your partner, there's a lot of movement from here. They're circling, they're snapping you down, they're doing all kinds of things and they can switch at any time to bring the other hand in. So you can't get caught up on one hand if your partner switches hands. You have to switch your defensive hands to that hand so they can't just throw hands across and strangle you. It's a very common thing, you know, they're circling around and moving around and from here I throw the hand on by and then I slip a guillotine in. Or from here we're moving around, I throw the hand on by and I slip a guillotine through. And the onus is on you as a defensive man to understand which hand is her strangle hand and to put defensive hands on that strangle hand so she can't slip it on through and get to any kind of, you know, high elbow, low elbow or arm and guillotine. Alright, so now no matter which guillotine your partner is going to go for, as they go to sit back, if you can re-center your head and you can get your head to their central line, and as they go to sit back, you can get your head to their central line, you can always slip out and away. Okay? So as your partner goes to sit, whether it's high elbow, whether it's low elbow, and your partner goes to sit from here, if they go to sit down, let's go high elbow this time, your partner goes to sit and as they go to sit I can separate the hips and I can circle my head out and re-center my head on my partner's center line, you're out of the guillotine before it even started. Okay? So recognize that whether your partner goes, maybe she goes for a low elbow this time, she just has everything locked, your partner goes to sit through, I just post my partner's hips so she can't connect her hips to mine. Now as she goes to sit down, I just push the hips, I tuck my own chin to my chest in the direction she wants to go, and that gives me space for my head to clear my partner's ribcage. From here, my head hits into my partner's ribcage, so I bow my head, chin to chest, and as she goes to lock her legs and move me around, I just circle my head out to my partner's center line, and we're ready to go in and re-center the head. So we can do this with high elbow, low elbow, with arm in guillotine, we just play here, let's say I lose the battle for defensive hands, now the whole thing is I don't allow her to connect her hips to mine. As she goes to sit, as she typically does, we just circle the head, and now from here it leads us into all of our body locks and whatever else we want to do from these positions. Okay, so just get in the habit of wherever you go through transitions, and obviously it's going to be different than this when you're doing it live, there's going to be a lot of movement, maybe you end up here in the transition or another transition, but just re-centering the head, always back to the center line, will get you out of a lot of trouble when you're talking about guillotines. Alright, so let's look at the most conservative ways to escape, not just the high elbow, but pretty much any guillotine. And that is the second your partner goes to fit a grip in, you just immediately roll through, you post hands on the hips, and you make sure they can't connect hips to you. This takes away the chin to chest action, this takes away their ability to lock their legs around you, and it gives you the ability to roll through, and then on the other side, re-center your head and go into your full defense and then back into offense. So whatever I see, try headlock, my partner goes in, puts a high elbow in place, and from here she goes to sit to guard. The second I see this, we're just going to post on my partner's hips, and we're just going to look to roll all the way through. I roll on whatever side my head is, so if I head to my partner's right side, I roll towards my partner's right side, and I fall down to my left shoulder. So when she goes to put that high elbow in, I just hit a quick rotation, and I roll all the way through, we move back up into a turtle position, we re-center the head, and now we're ready to go in and go right to our offense or at least counter with some kind of defensive reaction. So the second I see, and we'll see this with low elbows and high arm and guillotines as well, the second I see someone locking a guillotine, and I just want to be very conservative, you feel like it's coming on tight, just roll through, re-center the head on the opposite side. It's very simple, but effective. So she comes in, she goes high elbow, the second I see this, I'm fighting the hand, I'm trying to fight the hand, she goes to sit, we just roll on through, we re-center the head, and now we're ready to go in and start attacking our partner. The whole thing from here is that as I go to roll through, I roll, now she can't crunch my chin to my chest. Now as we go to come up, I'm re-centering my head, so I'm moving my head towards my partner as we come up. So she's trying to keep that strong grip, my head moves towards my partner's, and we're out back to center, and now our head's out, and we're ready to go back into offense. So we roll all the way through, we don't relinquish bottom position, and we end up back in a more or less neutral position most of the time, ready to go right into attacks. So whenever your partner has a guillotine, and you try to jump to side control, it usually works and usually gets you out, but if your partner has a high elbow and you jump to side control, you just get strangled. So the typical defense with guillotines, and we'll look at this more as we go in, is to start running around to the opposite side of the head so you can pass to side control. If you run to the same side as the head, then you get strangled, so it's no good. But with a high elbow, if she runs to the same side as the head, or the opposite side of the head, and she tries to pass me to side control with the high elbow, you just get strangled. So the first thing we have to do, the second my partner goes to sit, if she goes high elbow, I feel the high elbow coming in, as she goes to sit, I just take my right leg up, and I just reach my right hand over my partner's back. So now as she goes to sit, I just take my elbow inside my partner's hip, and as she goes to lock her legs around me, we just use the right elbow to close my partner's shoulder down, and I just run around my partner's legs like so. And now she has a choice, because she's in a low elbow guillotine, I'm either just releasing the guillotine, which will happen a lot of times, or from here, she gets over committed to it, and I just take her hand and I wedge it between my shoulder and between my neck. And now from here we lock the hands, we pull everything towards us, and now I control my partner's hand, and I just roll my right shoulder forward in towards my partner's neck, and from here we get strong Von Fluss triangles. If your partner lets go of the guillotine, you pass the side control, your partner keeps the guillotine, you end up with a nice triangle from side control yourself. The main thing is, I have to turn my body and reach up and over the shoulder. That converts the high elbow to a low elbow guillotine, so now I can actually pass the side control, and then my whole thing is beating my partner's legs by controlling the inside position with my elbow relative to her hip. So she goes high elbow, the second she goes to sit, I'm here. Now she goes to lock her legs, we just run around. If she lets go, we're ready to go in and pass with our top pins. She keeps her hand locked, I shoot my left hand forward, and we control our partner's wrist and we trap it between our ear and our shoulder. When she goes to pull it out now, it's too late. Now we focus on getting our right shoulder connected to our partner's neck, and now we just lean everything forward, retracting the right elbow, and we get strong strangulations with the Von Fluss. It's very important you don't try to jump to side control like we just did on the opposite side of your head if your partner has a high elbow. You just strangle yourself. So the whole thing, from a little bit different angle, is the second I feel from front head locker, wherever the case is, she goes to put that high elbow in place. If I just reach, you can't reach. So I turn my body, I step my right leg up, and that allows me to reach. And now I move this way a little bit. Now as she goes to jump to guard or sits to guard, we just carry on past her legs because we have the inside elbow relative to her hip. And now we can go in and either pass if she lets go or finish with our own strangle if she keeps her hands locked. All right, so now we naturally have to get deeper and deeper into leg entanglements. The first leg entanglement we're going to deal with is when our partner puts a shin across our hips and throws a leg over our back, then moves into half guard and actually locks the legs, and then of course closed guard, which is the most dangerous to deal with. Okay, so from this position, she goes into a high elbow guillotine. She puts a shin across my hips and she puts a leg up and over my back, like so. So now, like, oh man, this is no good. I have to address this connection. The best way to address this connection is from here to push the knee across in this fashion and to walk my legs out and away, and then we'll make it impossible for my partner to follow with the opposite leg if I have a wedge over my partner's knee and thigh here. The second this is cleared, you have to go into a defensive role because the problem is from here, she has a high elbow, and if you try to jump across the side control and you don't get the hand over, you're just going to get strangled, and you're getting strangled the whole time here. So of course, time is the X factor, getting strangled as the high elbow comes in. You're fighting defensively. If you try to jump over, by the time you jump over, you're going to be strangled most of the time, okay? And because of the fact that the leg is open over your back, it forces you to pass. If you're going to pass in a direction, it forces you to pass into the same side as the head's on, which is no good. So the number one way to escape when you feel this shin is across and this leg's over, the guillotine's tight, is clear the legs by pushing the knee in one direction, circling the other, and then go into a defensive roll like we just did. So if we're here, she goes high elbow, shin goes across, I just posted my partner's hip, I posted my partner's knee. Now she goes to start finishing, I run, run, run, and we go into this defensive roll. She will naturally always try to follow me as I go into the roll through. So she goes in, I go to roll, she goes to follow, and I roll through, and now from here, I'm ready to go back into offense. So the key is as I push the knee one direction, my body shuffles in the opposite direction, and then immediately right into a defensive roll. Hand centers, I'm going to back up, ready to go right into offense from here. The second the shin comes across, you just fly the leg over, don't try to drive into the guillotine, the high elbow, it's going to be too tight, you don't have that much time. I just rest the knee position, disentangle the legs, and then go into a defensive roll, get back to neutral. So now my partner actually locks their legs. They get to a high elbow, they lock their legs, and we're in a half guard, we have some trouble now. Whenever I see this, my partner goes in, high elbow, she locks her legs in a half guard. Now from here, she gets to crunching my chin to my chest, and it's harder, I can't roll from here because the legs are locked. The second I see this, we're going to immediately go into a high tripod, and look to insert a left leg as a butterfly hook. My whole thing from here is I've got to clear this right leg. I have to free at least my knee to go into a defensive roll. So you have a choice from here. When you go into a high tripod, you can either post on your partner's hip, and you can try to go over the high elbow to convert it to a low elbow, or you can post on two hips. The choice is yours, depending on how tight the guillotine is. If I feel like the guillotine isn't quite on yet, then I take my time, I go to two hips, I go into a tripod, and then I work to free my leg. But if you feel like you're getting strangled, and the lights are going out, convert it to a low elbow first, and then quickly post on the hips and pop up. So converting it to a low elbow will give you more time to go into the defensive reaction. So if I feel like it's coming on, I post on the hips and not going to have enough time, I just reach, and I pull to a low elbow. And now from here, I drive my shoulder forwards, and I fight out of a low elbow position. If on the other hand, from this position, she goes high elbow, maybe I'm having a hard time getting over the shoulder, whatever the case is, from here, we post on the hips, and right from here, we point our right knee down towards the floor. We quickly insert a butterfly hook, and when she goes to lock on tight, we just free that knee. Now, once the knee is free, we can roll. If the foot comes out great, if not, no worries. She goes to finish, I have freed my foot on the roll through. As she goes to finish and follow me through, we roll through, and now we're out. So once the knee is free, that's your cue to start rolling through. So we can convert it to a low elbow, which we'll look at other defenses for later, or we can go into a high elbow defense where we post on two hips and looking to free the knee. So that's going to be a race, can you free the knee before your partner ends up strangling you? All right? So she locks up high elbow, she locks the legs, I can't roll. Right from here, posting on two hips, high tripod. Now I point my knee down towards the floor. If I have to, I can even post to my partner's knee and insert a butterfly hook. However you're going to do it, butterfly hook goes in. She goes to finish, we free the knee, we start that defensive roll, and now we're out. And back to neutral. This is going to lead into kind of going into low elbow defenses, because our whole thing, when our partner locks their legs in a closed guard and she gets to a high elbow position, my whole goal is to reach over the shoulder and just convert it to a low elbow position. Okay? So from here, she has my head on this side, and she has a high elbow. My whole thing from here is to step my left leg up, and as I step my left leg up, that opens up my shoulder. She goes to keep that elbow nice and high, I open up my shoulder, I shoot everything up, and then I shoot it forward. And I just catch a cross face on my partner. And now from here I pull the elbow down. And now we convert it to a low elbow position, where now from here we can go into all of our low elbow defenses. So the second I see my partner actually lock their legs in a closed guard, and they have a high elbow, now you have almost no time. The knees are pinched, they're pulling to their chest, the lower body's engaged, you can't roll, you're not going to have enough time to do anything from here, if the mechanics are correct on her part, besides making a conversion to a low elbow, which would give you more time, and then once you're in a low elbow, you can go in and start your defensive moves. So we're going to go into low elbow guillotines after this, and then we'll go into full defenses from closed guard with low elbow guillotines. All right, so now this is a great kind of segue into low elbow guillotines. Low elbow guillotines are common, most of the time when you're dealing with a high level, guys will start with a high elbow, the defensive guy will defend well, and you'll end up in a low elbow and have to go and finish from there. Low elbow guillotines are very, very tight. You know, they're not as tight positionally as arm-in guillotines, but they're easier to finish because you don't have the arm stuck in there. So they're kind of this middle ground between, they're not as tight as high elbows, and they don't have as much control as arm-in finishes, but they do have, it is much easier to finish with low elbow guillotines than it is to finish with arm-in guillotines, mechanically speaking. So they're kind of in the in-between between arm-in and high elbow guillotines. Now we're going to look at some defenses to our partner locks low elbow guillotines, going from conservative to, okay, now she has her legs wrapped around me, what can I do from here? All right, so real quick, just going to go over the same most conservative defense you can have to pretty much any guillotine. When your partner goes to actually lock up the guillotine, just going into a basic roll through, and the principles and the idea, mechanics, are the same from high elbow to low elbow, so we're just going to review it quickly just so it's in here and you guys understand that you can do this with multiple guillotines. So she goes in, whether from a seated position or from a front headlock, the second she goes in, she gets a low elbow guillotine, and from here she goes in to start locking your hands. If I can, I re-center my head as always, okay, it's always a first defense, I don't want to, you know, roll willingly to bottom position, even though the chances of me coming up are pretty high. If I can stay on top, I want to stay on top by re-centering the head. A lot of times you start getting deeper and deeper and you feel like you're trying to re-center and you can't do it, she goes to start locking her legs, whenever I see this we just post the hip, post the knee, we roll on through, we re-center the head, and now we're back into neutral position, ready to go. So same thing with the high elbow, just doing it with the low elbow, understanding that the most conservative guillotine defense, the second they get a hand on you, before they can lock the legs or start crunching the chin to the chest, just roll through, get back to neutral, and then do your thing from there. Okay, so just like with the high elbow, when our partner has a low elbow we can run to side control, but instead of with the high elbow having to convert it first to a low elbow, we can just run right to side control. I'm also going to add a little misdirection to re-center the head in this clip as well. So she puts a low elbow guillotine on, and now, because it's a low elbow guillotine, we can just run right to side control. So the second my partner locks up, we just post my partner's hip, and from here we post on our partner's knee. When she goes to start going in and from here strangling me, if at any point she converts to a high elbow, I have to get over her shoulder. If she stays on a low elbow, I stay on her knee. So just understand this difference here. When she goes to pull me in, we just lean forward and run up and around to side control, to cover our partner's hips, and then we play either dilemma between pinning or if she keeps the hands locked, fond de l'eau. So same as before. So if at any point she goes from low elbow to high elbow, you have to go from knee to shoulder. So understand that there is some changes in gripping here, depending on where your partner goes with her elbow. In this position, when I go to start moving and running around to the opposite side and moving into side control, if my partner tries to follow me and she stoots around with me, she uses her feet to scurry, scurry, scurry, I can use that to misdirect and recenter my head to the center line. I can walk one way and then quickly whip back in the opposite direction and center my head back up. So we're going to add this little misdirection here from our attempt to run to side control, and I use a misdirection so as she gets to follow me, I just quickly circle back in the opposite direction as my head comes out and ends up back in my partner's center line. So from here, we go in, we start running, she goes to scurry with me. And now from here, we just recenter the head. So as she's walking to her left, I'm walking to her left, and then from here, we just quickly move back right slightly, and now that takes my head back to center. So she doesn't want to get patched, she goes to follow, follow, follow. Now we're ready to go in and start with all of our attacks right from there. So very similar to the one from high elbow, but a little bit different hand position, and we can add a misdirection in there now to recenter the head to get going back to all of our offense, going back to body locks, passing, forcing half guard, things like that. So understand that all the escapes we did for high elbow, they can work here. I can go into the roll, just like from cross shin, my partner puts her shin across, I can go into the roll from half guard by going into a high tripod, we can do all those escapes. So understand those are still there. In addition, because it's not a high elbow guillotine, I can use a little bit different form of escape. Understand that when my partner goes into any kind of guillotine, she needs to crunch my chin into my chest. If I can stop that chin to chest action, she's not going to be able to finish me. This particular guillotine defense, I use against, I forget if it was from half guard or the shin coming across, but I use this upper body grip fighting to defend Rafael Dominguez's guillotine and to defend Craig Jones's guillotine at Quintet when we fought for the second time. So this is one of my highest percentage defenses here. I take an inside or a wrist grip with four fingers and I look to pull my partner's wrist down the best I can. As I pull the wrist down, I elongate my neck and I look to shoot my forehead as close up towards my partner's armpit as I possibly can. And I post my head on the floor. So I wedge my forehead against the floor and that makes it almost impossible for my partner to crunch my chin to my chest because I'm using the floor to assist me in keeping my head wedged in place. What this will look like is my partner goes to take a low elbow guillotine. The second I feel this, I just go and I grab my partner's wrist. Now as she falls back, I don't try to pull out, I don't try to pressure in. All I focus on is looking up the best I can and I just shoot my head towards my partner's armpit as she goes to fall. Like so. So that now from here, she casts a leg up and over my back and we just go in and we just turn the hips like so. From this position, when she goes to finish me, she has no ability to crunch my chin to my chest because of the fact that one, the grip is low because I have a hand on it. Number two, my head is assisted by the floor. If my head's off the floor when she goes to crunch, she's going to finish me. My head's on the floor. From here I'm pushing my ear towards my partner's armpit, my forehead's coming up, and then when I get as high as I can, I plant. When she goes to beat me from here, it's just not going to happen. And now we just keep our hips turned like so. I don't want to, in this particular scenario, there'll be other scenarios where we switch hips, I don't want to turn my hips in this direction because now she can insert butterfly hooks and start to off balance me from here. So from here I deny butterfly hooks. When she goes to move me around, put butterfly hooks in, it's not going to happen. Now from here, I just incrementally work to pull the wrist down, one, two, three, four, and just pop my head out. May take 30 seconds, may take a minute, depending on how stubborn your partner is. But eventually, that grip's going to separate. Once the hand is separated, we immediately post on our partner's knee and we stuff it. Now as the head comes out, we can go back to the hand. I'm sorry, as we're over the knee, we can go back to the hand. When she goes to relock, the head comes out and now we're in a perfect passing position, chest to chest, we're ready to go in and get past our partner's legs. So yes, you can use the rolling method like we just talked about. We can just post on the hip, post on the knee, roll through. You can do that. This is another great defense that is my favorite defense to gi teams. So from here, we go in. The second she goes to fall, we just grab the wrist. The higher towards the hand we can get, the better. But a lot of times the hand is hidden, the wrist will suffice from here. From here, she goes to start falling down, we just drive towards her. I push my forehead up towards my partner's armpit. I push my ear up towards my partner's armpit. And now from here, when she goes to finish me, the floor assists me. And now from here, once the hands separate, one, two, three, we just stuff the knee, like so. She'll be trying to relock desperately because she doesn't want to get her guard passed, she wants to hold on to this mission. So now from here, as she goes to relock, I just separate. I'm over the knee, head comes out, and now from here, we're ready to go in and start our guard passing game. Okay? This is a very, very efficient way to stop your partner from finishing you. It takes a little bit longer to get out. It's not as conservative. If you want to just get out, just roll right through, recenter the head. Then you're back to neutral, but you're both on your knees. If you want to stay on top, this is a great way to not only escape the gi team, but also force half guard and pass. Takes longer, but it usually ends up with you in a little bit better position when you do escape. Okay, so just going to run through this quickly, just so you guys understand that you have both of the options here that you did, that we looked at previously. You have the option to post on your partner's hips and start freeing the knee, rolling through, recentering the head. If at any point your partner switches to a high elbow and you feel like you're going to get strangled, you can come over the shoulder and convert it back to a low elbow. You also have the ability to use the wrist grabbing method with the high head and using the floor to wedge your head in place. Just to reiterate this, we have the ability from here to go up, put a butterfly hook in and then roll through. We also have the ability where as she goes to start laying down, she goes and pull me into half guard, she lops her legs and from here we just cover our partner's knee with our left leg and we just come forward and we just move into this situation here. When she goes to strangle me now, she can't get that important chin to chest action by crunching her elbow down towards her hip. Then we just spend time now working our head free, taking your wrist grip and then popping our head out, chest to chest and half guard. Now we're ready to go in, start passing and going into work from there. Same thing we just looked at, just making sure we understand that we have these same escapes when our partner locks half guard. We can go into a roll or we can use the floor assist method to take a little bit more time to free ourself but now we're in top half guard, passing chest to chest. Now we have a couple of different methods going into situations where our partner has a low elbow guillotine and she has a closed guard locked. Understand that if she transitions to a high elbow guillotine and you're in closed guard, you have to take the time to take the hand back over the head, pull the elbow down and convert it back to a low elbow guillotine. This is imperative. One thing that we can look at from this position is we can use the same method that we just used to pull the wrist down but this time we're going to turn our hips in the opposite direction because my partner has closed guard, it's much harder for her to insert a butterfly hook and ultimately what we want is her to unlock her legs anyways. From here, she goes in, she locks a low elbow guillotine, she locks her legs, I'm like, oh man, this is no good. From this position, the first thing I'm going to look to start doing from here, me personally, is I'm going to grab the wrist and I'm going to take my head up high like so. Now from here, I'm going to take my right leg and I'm going to backstep it. So instead of turning my hip down like we were in half guard, I turn my opposite hip of the side my head is trapped on up and I just backstep into this position. What this does is it wedges your partner's knee in place. Basically what your partner is trying to do from here is she's trying to crunch right elbow down towards the hip and pull the knees in towards the chest to finish. So by you wedging your partner's elbow in place, or your partner's knee in place rather, with this backstep, it makes it impossible for her to move that bottom leg. So from here, we come forward with the head and now this will do a pretty good job but if you have someone with good mechanics, the legs are pulling in now. So their legs are coming in and the pulling of the legs and the pulling of the elbow, sometimes she can still manage to crunch her chin to the chest. And you won't always be perfectly like way up here like you will in drilling. A lot of times it's imperfect and you're here and you're still getting strangled. Whenever I see in a live situation the guillotine is very tight, we just sit to this position here. She can try as hard as she wants to strangle me now. It means nothing. And now from here, we just work. We just wait. Start separating our partner's hands. If the legs stay locked, we just play a waiting game. We separate our partner's hands and then we quickly monitor our partner's wrist, pop our head out and we re-center. More than likely what's going to happen is because you're turning your hips, you're backstepping, your partner from here, you don't sit all the way to your hip. If you sit all the way to your hip, you're just going to get mounted. You're just backstep here. More than likely, your partner from here will take her foot, will take her feet and uncross them and try to put a butterfly hook in. The second we see that, no problem. We just post on my partner's leg. And now we have a choice of either one, scooting out and away and then going into our roll like we did before. Or two, she goes to put butterfly hook in. We quickly push the knee down and we step into half guard on the opposite side. And now from here, the guillotine is on the wrong side. My partner goes to finish me from here. It's a pretty easy thing. You just put a cross face in, start driving forward and separating those hands. Okay? So we can go in. She puts a guillotine on. She gets me into closed guard. At any point she goes high elbow, I convert to low elbow. From here we get a hold of the wrist. Now we drive our head forward, perfect world. We want to be here. Less than perfect, probably more realistic. In a live situation we end up here. From this position, we don't want to get finished. So because her legs are pulling now, we have to wedge that knee in place. So we back step. I don't put my hip on the floor. If I put my hip on the floor, I get mounted. When she goes to finish, it's useless. Now if she stays here, we just work and we play a time game where we separate the hands and we take the head out. It's going to take time. You're not going to get strangled. Your partner wants to make something happen. Here's the problem with the butterfly hook. When the legs come open, we can either push the knee down and then as we push the knee down we scoot our hips away and then we start our rolling action like we did before. Or we want to stay on top. We push the knee down and we step into half guard on the opposite side. When she goes to crunch my chin to my chest now, it means nothing. I can finish the bottom salute from here. She has to let the hands go and now from here we're top half guard ready to pass. So using the same wrist pull method that we looked at before to defend, we have a slightly different hip position. Instead of turning our inside hip down, we turn our opposite hip down. And then from there we see what our opponent's reactions are. They keep the legs locked and we play a time game to escape or do they palm a butterfly hook and to try to change the angle, take you over to bottom position. And then if they do that, unlock the legs, posting on the knee and either going out and away or over to half guard. So another way that we can escape this gate team when our partner has a fully locked legs around us and a closed guard is by using a method where we four point out. Now this is a method that has never really worked great for me. I can do it, but it's not my preferred method, but it was some of my other teammates preferred methods and I've seen them escape very tight gate teams with it. So my preferred method, me personally, is always using the wrist grab method that come forward and bring the head in. And a lot of the other guys in the team will use this four point method and it is very effective. It's just not what I like to do, but it is effective. And they have effectively escaped gate teams, my gate teams with them, so I know it's effective. Where you're in a gate team and from here, the idea with this four point method is that I want to four point and I want to take my hip, my chin down towards my partner's hip, almost like I'm crunching my own chin to my chest and make enough space to take my head out to my partner's center line. Okay. So when she goes to lock in with this gate team, I go lock up a little tighter. I lock into a four point like so. And now from here, we either shake, shake, shake, and we take our head out. Or a lot of times if the gate team's tight, you'll have to use a thumb post. And most of the time, if it's tight enough, you'll have to thumb post inside your partner's arm, inside your partner's elbow. Now it's hard to talk because the gate team's going to be tight, but I'll show you how it's performed with the thumb post. The reason I don't like this method and the reason why I'm not good at it is because it requires some amount of shoulder flexibility. And I'm very good at bringing my shoulders forward into concave positions, but I'm absolutely atrocious at bringing my shoulders back in this direction. I'm not explosive at all. My bridges are terrible and it's hard for me to reach up and get my thumb in there. That's why I don't ever really use this method because I'm just inflexible in that direction. But for guys who are flexible and can easily reach the thumb, it's a pretty easy thing for them to do. So I'm going to attempt to do it and get my hand up to the thumb. And you should be able to do this. I am just, I'm oddly inflexible in this direction. Like I'm not nearly as flexible as a normal person in this position, but a normal person should be able to do this. So we go into a four point and I'm just going to run through it. And we use a thumb post on our partner's elbow to start clearing our head in. You see, even reaching, I have a hard time getting to the elbow. That's why I don't really use this method, but it is an effective method. And the key is to push the thumb down. And as I push the thumb down, my head comes down towards my partner's hips and in towards the center line. Okay. So when she goes to lock up, if it's not so tight, I just got into a four point. I'll just shake. I take my head out. If it is tight, I push the elbow in and I guise my head in towards the center line. So we can use a four point method and start moving out and away from these heat teams. Or I feel like my partner has locked her legs. She's got a fully locked closed guard and we can circle our head in towards the center line. The whole thing is to shake, shake, shake, bow the head and bring it in towards our partner's center line. If we feel like it's super tight, we use an elbow post to clear the head first. So you push the elbow down and then as you circle your head in, you push the elbow in towards the center line and you follow the same path your head follows with the elbow and it gets the head free. So this is a great method. Normal people can do it. My shoulders are very inflexible in this direction, so it's hard for me to reach and get that thumb post, but it may work perfect for you. All right. So this is kind of our last ditch knee post method where I'm trying to escape. Let's say maybe you're not confident in the four point escape or the four point escape isn't working. You're in a four point and you're still getting strangled for whatever reason that may be. Or you try to use the wrist grab method and try to take your head forward. But before your head comes forward and you wedge it on the floor, there was already too much chin to chest action and you're getting strangled. All right. So either you're trying to four point and you're getting strangled or from here you're trying to use your head as a wedge against the floor and you're getting strangled. Okay. And you know, these, these are the two highest percentage escapes from here against someone with good mechanics. People show things like body locking and putting your shoulder in the center of the chest and doing all the escapes you learned in 1998. They don't work. So that's why I didn't show them. And I'm showing these ones that are actually highly effective. So when I feel and by what I mean is like, you know, someone put the guillotine in, you take your shoulder in the middle of their chest and you try to drive in and you do all this stuff and you try to do this. This does nothing to stop the chin to chest action and she just goes into the guillotine and she finishes. Okay. So don't do any of that bullshit. That's never going to work. All right. So whenever I feel the four points not working, grabbing the wrist and bringing the head forward isn't working. Now I have to start dealing with the leg position. Okay. And this is again, a last ditch method. And we're never going to go into an end game after this. So she has a guillotine. I feel like I'm getting beat from here. I have my hand on the wrist. I'm trying to wear my head forward, but I feel my head getting crunched and my chin getting crunched to my chest. Whenever I feel this from this position, I post my partner's knee with the intention of shooting my hips forward towards my partner's head and to get her knees below my hip line. So as she goes to start crunching, I post and I shake, shake, shake. And I get her knees just below my hip line. When she's locking tight, the legs won't fall all the way down. And all I need is this. And now from here, I can shrimp out and away and move into this position here where now I can monitor my partner's wrist. Now there's no hip to hip connection. From here, it depends on what she does. Most of the time, she'll look to start pummeling legs, getting different leg configurations. And now as we start to go from here, we can either pass across the side control or if she scissors her legs and goes belly down, we try to stay gating, we just circle out, get our head to center, and now ready to go back into offense. Okay? So the key here is we are trying to get her knees, her knee line, the line that draws her knee together, below our hip line. If we can do that, we can shrimp out and escape. You can pass the side control, roll through, or go into various other escapes from there. But the main thing is just form that disconnection with my legs and my partner's legs. So we go in, she starts strangling, I'm like, oh man, this is no good. So I turn my hips towards the side my head's on, like so. I post my partner's knee. She goes to start strangling me, I shake, shake, shake. I'm end up here. Now from here, we shrimp out. We grab the wrist. Wherever she chooses to go now, it's going to be hard. We use a knee posting method to post our way out, shrimp, and then clear the knee line, lower our hip line, and we're out and ready to go into our counter attacks. All right, so now let's look at a mounted guillotine. Again, if your partner has a high elbow, you have to take the time to reach over the shoulder, pull the elbow down, and then go back to the hips. So let's understand what we're looking for with the mounted guillotine. It's not going to look pretty, and it's going to take multidirectional bridges and kips from side to side in order to separate my partner's hips and mine. Ultimately, what I'm doing is I have to create some kind of disconnection between my partner's hips and mine and make it so her legs aren't wrapped around mine. Now let's look at, we can bridge to both sides. Let's look at what's going to go on if we do bridge and we do take our partner to one side or the other. If she has me mounted and she has me in a guillotine. If I bridge my partner across to this side, and let's say I give a bridge and I start kipping, whatever the case is, and we fall, she falls down to this hip from here. As I come up on top of my partner, she can still continue strangling me because of the extreme shin to chest action. So whenever possible, I mean the main thing is to get a hip to hip disconnection, but whenever possible, I want to start bridging and kipping and getting my partner out to this side. So now when she goes to crunch my chin to my chest, it's a much more difficult thing from here. There's no body weight involved. So whenever possible, I want to look to start taking my partner out and bridging and kipping to the opposite side of my head is on. All right. But we can fall to either side. Just try to make sure that your partner doesn't keep a hip to hip contact and their legs wrapped around you. That's the most important thing. So if you have to bridge and kip and you have to go multi-direction, you end up falling to one side or the other. It doesn't make a difference so much. The main goal is to disconnect those hips from yours and if possible, fall to the correct side. Okay. So what you're going to find is she's a guillotine. If she goes high elbow, I can't reach over my partner's shoulder from here. So what I have to do is I have to bridge. I can even temporarily take my partner's fore hip. I have to bridge from here and pull that elbow down to a low elbow. Now immediately I take my hands into position. Now this is going to be something that's, you don't have much time from here. So how your hands land is pretty much how you have to bridge with right away. You have three, five, maybe eight seconds for you depending on mechanics. So many times you'll have hands, two hands on the hips. Many times you'll have one hand across the hip with a reinforced frame. Just posture up real quick. The reinforced hand like so, or you'll have the opposite configuration like so. After you land, this is how you have to bridge. Anything that bars my partner's hips or gets a wedge around my partner's hips so I can start bridging and moving her around is what I need. So from here we have hands in place. I'm going to start by bridging. I bridge to one side. I fail. I bridge to the other side and then I start kipping, kipping, kipping, kipping and I bring everything inside and as my head comes, as my knees come inside, my head comes out and we recenter. Okay. So here's where we go in. We bridge to one side. We fail. We bridge to the side and now we start falling to the wrong side and now from here we come out. She holds on. As she holds on, we just go into our defensive rule. We recenter the head and now we're out. So the escape starts by bridging, multi-directional bridges if you have to, multi-directional kipping if you have to, and this is all pin escapes obviously. I'm not going to cover it here. Multidirectional bridging and kipping to at least disconnect your partner's hips and legs from yours. Whatever side you fall to, one side's going to be harder than the other because when she falls, if you fall to this hip, now you can still crunch chin to the chest because of the fact that there's body weight involved and from here I can start getting body weight up on top of my partner. Whereas if we fall to the other side and we're over here, now there's no body weight. I have no ability to come up to my partner unless we go completely belly down and from here it's a pretty easy thing for her to either pass or circle her head out and now she's gone. Okay? The main thing from here and in a perfect world, we want to have hands across our partner's hips. We want to have perfect hand placement. That's not always going to be the case. The most important thing is we get hands to our partner's hips, whether it be two posts, whether it be a cross frame this side with the reinforced post or cross frame this side with a reinforced post. Okay? A lot of times you start in a closed guard and then you try to move around, your partner ends up mounted and you're already getting strangled. You have to make something happen from here. The main thing is we start hitting bridges from one side to the other. We hit a bridge and fail, we hit a bridge and then we go into a kick and from here head comes out or the head stays in, she's tight and now from here we start working to get on top and side control. If she comes belly down and tries to follow me, I go belly down and I circle out. If we start going to the opposite side, however the hands may be, and if my hands across here, I can start pushing because I have a reinforced post hand, I can also push in the opposite direction. So whether one hand's across or the other hand's across, I can push with enough force in each direction to get things moving. The main thing is just have some kind of connection with my hands and arms to my partner's hips. Maybe I bridge in this direction and it fails, I bridge and I start kipping, kipping, kipping and now from here I try to circle my head out. Maybe my partner holds on and we roll and we start that rolling escape. But the escapes all start from a situation where you're bridging in multiple directions, kipping if possible and if you have to in multiple directions and disconnecting those hips from yours. And then once you do that, then we can go into all the previous escapes, recenter the head and get ourselves out of there. All right so now we're in closed guard in a guillotine and of course it all comes down to time. The first thing I try is either a four point method if you like that or I grab the wrist and we use that method and if those aren't working and you're still getting strangled, so if those are working obviously you're not going to get strangled. If those aren't working and you're getting strangled, the end game starts when you post on the knee and you try to start using the method of the knee post method to shrimp out and away and you can't get your partner's knee line below your hip line in the time that you have available before you have to tap or you're strangled unconscious. Okay so for example, if she has me strangling and she's doing a good job of pulling her knees into her chest and I'm posting, posting, and I just can't get those knees clear before the strangle comes in too strong, that's my end game from here. So I'm posting on the knee or I'm trying to initially come forward and grab the wrist, she's crunching my chin to my chest and I'm going into a four point and I feel like it's not happening and then I try to post to the knee and I just don't have enough time and that's when I end up getting strangled and that's your end game there. So as always it comes down to a time thing. I've run through my main escapes and if I can hit those escapes before my partner finishes me and the strangle comes on too tight, great. But if not and she has the mechanics and she has the control long enough and it's of course you're in a fully locked Gait team with full guard closed so you made a lot of mistakes here, you have about five seconds to understand that these are my escapes and then that's it, it slides out after that.
