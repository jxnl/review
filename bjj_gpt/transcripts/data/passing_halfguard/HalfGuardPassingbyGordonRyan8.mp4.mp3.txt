 Alright, so now we're going to move into passing with a knee-side underhook. And the reason why I left this out before was because it generally doesn't go with the other upper body positions that we look to start moving into. And it's hard to actually pommel into a knee-side underhook when your partners are already flattened out. So we look to flatten our partner out and move from a top-head and arm, and then we went through the general sequence of going from a top-head and arm to just a cross-face to a head block, to double-unders. And you don't really see a knee-side underhook happening too much when your partner's already flattened out. Most of the times you see a knee-side underhook happen is when your partner is coming up towards you. Where from here, your partner has an underhook, and then we use a knee-side underhook to start flattening your partner out and start going into a knee-side underhook. Or from a situation where we're passing, for example, with a top-head and arm, and from here for whatever reason we go in, we free our knee and we start to look to start passing in this direction. And where the case is, my partner looks to trap my leg, and now we get trapped in the half guard on the opposite side. We have to take our head across and start switching. Where now, we started with a force-head underhook, we started passing, my partner ended up recovering, and now we switch sides with a knee-side underhook. So we generally don't see it. And when we flatten our partner out here, we generally don't usually pummel into a knee-side underhook and get ourselves in a situation where we can expose the space between our partner's elbow and ribcage and look to start passing with knee-side underhooks. It doesn't really make sense for us to go into it before we're dealing with the other traditional upper body grips. So now we're going to look at using either knee-side underhook or body lock either underneath both our partner's arms or over top of our partner's arm and underneath one, where we start to get into a situation where after knee-side underhook, we'll go in and look to either use knee-side underhook, body lock combinations, and body locks where we have knee-side underhook, and we lock over our partner's arm. Now we're going to start going into all those knee-side passes where we look to start going in, passing our partner, and using that knee-side underhook. A knee-side underhook is very, very powerful, and we'll look at what the differences are now between using a knee-side underhook and using cross-face. All right, so now let's look at the similarities and differences between cross-facing and knee-side underhook. All right, understand that a knee-side underhook is going to be, number one, harder to get to, number two, more powerful of a position. When I put a cross-face into my partner, it's a pretty easy thing to go and expose my partner's jaw to the cross-face. But if my partner starts to tuck the chin into the chest and look to start moving me around, the purchase in the cross-face can easily be disrupted and my partner starts to off-balance me and keeps a proper body position. Okay, so it's much easier for me to get to the cross-face, but it's not as robust as the underhook because of the fact that my partner can move me around and clear the cross-face. When I look to get an underhook on the knee-side, it's much harder for me to actually move into the underhook, but once I get it, it's very robust. It's hard for my partner to move me around. So from here, I put this underhook in place. Now my partner goes to clear the underhook. It's almost impossible for her to do. I can start putting a lot of pressure on my partner and start going into strong passing positions. In addition, when I look to put a cross-face in place, if I start passing and at any point I pass to the near-side, my partner has the arm free so she can put a side guard in place. Let's say for whatever reason, we put a cross-face in place, my partner goes to give a big bridge towards me maybe, and from here, we'll have to start stepping out. My partner can put a near-side knee-elbow connection and start beating me with side guard here. If I pass, it's pretty rare that we pass to the side with underhook or cross-face, but if for whatever reason, my partner goes to give a big bridge and she unlocks her legs and I do step out and I pass to this side, my partner goes to lock that side guard. She can't get a knee-elbow connection. So the cross-face is much easier to get, but it's not as robust and doesn't give you the ability to stop your partner from locking a side guard on the near-side. Now when we play with the cross-face, understand that because you have direct control over your partner's head, you can point their head in a given direction and it makes it hard to give a strong bridge towards you. What this means is, when I put a cross-face in place, from here, and I start leaning forward towards my partner's opposite shoulder, when she goes to bridge towards me from here, she can't because of the fact that she's looking in the wrong direction. So when I put an underhook into place, now it's hard to get my partner looking in the correct direction I want to. So if she wants to give a strong bridge towards me, she can do so. So I have to make sure when I put my underhook in place, I have proper body positioning and I make sure I get my head over to the far side of our partner's body. But I can't have situations where I have this underhook in place, my partner takes a hand inside, she pinches down on my right arm and gives a strong bridge, now I can't pull it out, I'm getting swept over into bottom position and getting knocked over like so. Whereas with the cross-face, it's not impossible for your partner to do this, but it's much harder, even if my head is off the floor, she goes to bridge and because of the cross-face it makes it much harder for her to move me around. So with the underhook, it's imperative, let me put this underhook in place, we immediately start taking everything across to the far side. So my partner goes to bridge now, it's going to be a difficult thing to do. Okay? So this is one of the big differences with cross-face and underhook. With underhook, you don't have direct control of your partner's head, so a bridge, a near side bridge becomes much more of an issue, whereas with the cross-face it doesn't. Now on the flip side of this coin, a cross-face like so will allow your partner to put a butterfly hook in and start elevating you over the far shoulder, and if you lose purchase of the cross-face, it will be much easier for your partner to take you in this direction, okay, out to the far side. Whereas if you're wedged in underneath with a near side underhook and your partner goes to elevate you, there's just no way your partner can elevate you because your arm is physically wedging you in place on the near side of your partner's body, which the cross-face is doing, but if the cross-face slips, now you're beat. The underhook is never going to slip out. You'll always be able to have the underhook in place. So in general, all right, just coming full circle here, if we use a near side underhook, it's easier for my partner to off balance me to the near shoulder because of the fact that she can give a strong bridge in this direction due to the lack of direct control over my partner's head. But if my partner tries to elevate me over the far shoulder with a butterfly hook, she can't because of the fact that I'm physically wedged into place and there's no slippage of the near side underhook as my partner goes to elevate me out and over to the far side. Whereas with the cross-face, it's much harder for my partner to elevate me and bridge me over on the near side because of the fact that I have direct control over my partner's head. I can use the cross-face to make her look away from me. But there's slippage problems with the cross-face. So my partner goes to elevate me over the far shoulder. If the cross-face does slip, then I have issues going over the far shoulder. So if I use a cross-face, it's much harder for her to bridge towards me and off balance me, but easy with the butterfly hook to bridge away, or not to bridge, to start elevating me over the far shoulder and start going into Ashi Garami. Whereas with near side underhook, it's much easier for her to bridge towards me and much harder for her to elevate me far shoulder. So just underhook versus cross-face, why you use one versus the other, and what the pluses and minuses are when you're playing cross-face versus near side underhook. I generally prefer to use near side underhook. It's a little bit stronger, but you have to make sure that your head is in the proper position over on the far side so you don't get bridged over immediately. All right, so now we're going to look at going into entrances off of this near side underhook. And many times, the easiest way to enter into this near side underhook is anytime your partner is looking to come towards you and let's just start sitting up. So whenever I see my partner from here has maybe a knee shield half guard, but she has to start sitting up towards me and punch an underhook in, we can get them, we can stop the underhook, and from here we can go through and we can punch that near side underhook into place. Or now from here, we can go in and we catch, now I want to put my partner flat on the floor. So from here, I start leaning towards my partner's legs to make that elbow a little bit light and now I just pull my elbow back towards my own hip. And now from here, as I go to sit down towards my partner's far shoulder, we again just go in and we start walking our partner's legs flat. And now from here we go in and we catch our partner's far trap muscle. Now we pull everything towards us and we just take our head out to the floor and this is where we go in and start to play our passing game from. In case we have near side underhook, we can start to go into all of our pommels right from there. Another great way that we can set up near side underhook is from any position that we're using a far side underhook to pass like we did before, and maybe we get caught and our partner beats us on an initial pommel and we end up on the opposite side. Or maybe we're backtracking on purpose into my partner's legs, or from here I go to start passing, for example, with an underhook and a head block, and we go up, we start making a pass, we free our one leg, we can start passing in from here, my partner pushes my other knee down and we end up in half guard on the other side. Or now from here we start with a far side underhook but we converted to half guard on the opposite side and now that far side underhook is now a near side underhook and we can start going in and passing. Okay, so two very common ways to start entering into near side underhooks. As my partner goes to sit up towards me, either she goes to initially put an underhook in place or she has an underhook in place and she's trying to work from here and now we just go in and we use her underhook to expose that underhook for us and now we can start flattening our partner out. Or we start passing and we end up on the far side where we had a far side underhook and then that far side underhook as we go to pass my partner maybe re-pommels and beats me, puts me back in half guard but traps my left leg this time and now that far side underhook has now converted to near side underhook and we can start passing from there. Okay, so it's going to be hard for me to pommel in to a near side underhook when my partner is in here. So I'm going to be trying to knee elbow escape and always try to get this knee and elbow connected. So you can always count on my partner's elbow being in tight towards her rib cage with weight over it trying to come towards me. So it's going to be hard to pommel in underhooks in the near side in a traditional sense because my partner is always going to be trying to keep that elbow connected so tightly to her rib cage and inside my knee. So most of the times we see this is when we either one are trying to pass, we end up on the opposite side or my partner's upper back is exposed and the elbow is away from the rib cage because she's sitting up and trying to go into some kind of offense. For now we can get a near side underhook or we can expose our partner's waist and lock it to the body. All right, so now we're going to start passing with this near side underhook. Obviously we've looked at a ton of different pommeling positions. You're going to basically treat this very similar to the way that you would treat a cross face if you're going to start passing your partner's guard. Walking the knees away, playing with the inside elbow, posting your partner's knee, sliding in three quarter mouth, and then passing from there. So whenever I see we get this near side underhook, and we want to start going in and passing, first thing is always have to make sure my partner's in bridging me in this direction. The second we get here, we just go in and we post on the floor like so. So now my partner goes to move me around. It's a very difficult thing. And now we can go in and we can start playing this high tripod game. My partner goes to move me around from here. It's not going to be easy. So we can go in. And in general, what I recommend is if we're going to look to start walking my partner's knees away and playing with a low hip game, my hips stay low, I generally recommend keeping my head out here somewhere so my partner can't bridge me over in this direction. The further my head out is in this direction, the harder it will be for my partner to bridge and off balance me to the near side. So in general, if I look to start walking with a low hip game, I look to start going in and taking it inside elbow. I look to start going in and sliding my knee across. I'll generally keep my head out here somewhere. If I start going into a high tripod instead, then from here, I look to start taking my head as a head block because now my partner can't off balance me in this direction because of the fact that I have a high tripod now, my partner has no hip to hip connection. So if my hips are going to stay low and connected to my partner's, I think my head way out over here between my partner's elbow and my partner's shoulder, somewhere in this vicinity here. So when she goes to bridge, she can't do it. If I get here and she takes that elbow underneath and she's here and she goes to bridge, she can off balance me. So if I'm hip to hip, my head goes out wide. I start playing a passing game. And now from here, we look to start playing the same game we looked at with the cross face. So that's the general game that I play. I'm not going to say you don't always have to play that game. That's a general game that I prefer. It's very low risk. Your hips stay low. It's hard for your partner to off balance you. All right. Now you can also go into a high tripod game. Or from here, I take my head and I use a head block. So now my partner goes to off balance me. She can't bridge because of the fact that there's no hip to hip contact. And from here, if my partner ever goes to post to my hip, I'm going to start bridging towards me. It's not the same anymore because of the fact that she's bridging into my base of support. If she has a near side hip post and she bridges me that way, she's bridging me across the body. Here, she's bridging into my base of support. My base of support is on the side that I'm passing to. So she's going to have to post to my hip and bridge me around. Has very little effect. And in addition, it exposes double under hooks. They can also go into a high tripod game where I use a head block with near side under hook instead of far side under hook. Now we're going to start passing from here, play the same game where we start going in and making our passes nice and easy from here. So we play a general game where if our hips are low, we post the head out wide and we start walking our partner's knees away from us, just like we would do as if we had a cross face. If we go to a high tripod method, then we use an under hook near side and a head blocking method like so. But now again, my partner goes to move me around. It's hard. He pummels in a butterfly hook. We play the same leg pummeling game we looked to play before. That's our high tripod methods. And we go into the same pummeling series that we've went through this entire time before. So in general, if my hips are going to stay low, we take the head out nice and wide and we treat it like a cross face. We pass by stepping over the leg into mount. We pass by using an inside elbow. We pass by driving everything across. If we're going to go into a high tripod method, then we treat it more as we would if we had a top head and arm or if we had a foreside under hook and head block. We use the same pummels. We use a top pummel. We use front pummels. We use a knee slide method. We use the leg riding and we use all of those methods that we use from the high tripod. So passing methods are all the same. It just determines on what you're going to do. If your hips stay low, treat it as if you're going to pass to the cross face. If your hips go high, treat it as if you're going to pass with all of your pummel methods from a high tripod. All right, so this time we're going to pass very quickly, once again, to the near hip. We looked at passing to the near side under hook side from a foreside under hook and half guard before. Or from here, we would go in and we looked at passing from a situation where I had this near side under hook where we can go in and start passing to this side and then from here going right into a shin mount so that corner can't go in and start blocking side guard. We're going to look at the same thing here. But this time, we have a near side under hook and we're playing a pummeling game. Everything's happening quickly and for whatever reason, we end up passing to the near side. So whenever I see I go into a high tripod, for example, we play a pummeling game and from here I start passing out to the near side. But I don't want my partner to start using under hook to start coming up and off balancing me. Whenever I pass to the near side, we either one, look to go in and if we can, my partner goes to shoot up and we punch in double under hooks. Or two, we go in and we take that same inside bicep tie with a 10 finger grip. Where now from here we can start opening up that elbow and pummeling double under hooks. Or we can go in and we can start opening up our elbow so our partner takes the arm out. And from here we make a conversion to a cross face and an inside bicep tie. We'll have to start going in and exposing our partner's arm. We can also start to go into situations where we pass to the side. As my partner goes to go on block side guard and move me around or use his under hook, we're just going to immediately move to shin mount to dominate my partner's far hips. Now she goes to recover and move her out from here. We just go in, we slide across, we start playing a leg pummeling game where we can go to the side control. On the opposite side we can pass to mount. There's tons of different things we can do from there. So we looked at a situation where we looked to start passing across before in this passing series. Where from here we would go in and we'd start passing to the far side under hook side which ended up converting to a near under hook side like so. And then from here we just went in and immediately went to a shin mount position where we start going in and passing and unlocking your hands and moving around. So we're going to treat this as the same thing. This time we go in, we have near side under hook this time. We start going into a high tripod, however we may do it. We go in and we start passing near side like so. Now from here the big danger is that my partner bridges and off balances me and traps my elbow. If I see no bridge then we can go in and take the inside elbow position. We can go in and lock our hands. We can take double under hooks and start working from here. Most commonly the second I go into pass my partner will either use a collar tie or a frame inside to start bridging, pinching my elbow down and off balancing me. So the second I see this when she goes to start bridging, we just sit to this knee on belly slash shin mount here. And now when she goes to move me around we just go in, take the hand out, post our hands and start riding our partner's legs to make conversions into strong top pins, north south side control, mount or wherever you want from there. We pass to the near hip this time. We end up pommeling so that everything's happening quickly. We pass to the near side. Our partner goes to start bridging and just like before we make a conversion to knee on belly, shin mount and then work from there. Okay, so now let's look at converting to double under hooks off of this near side under hook. Many times when you start to go in and start passing because you have an under hook on the near side, your partner will use the far hand to start posting on your knee and stopping you from going into passes and will start shoving your leg back into half guard and freaking you out as you start going to pass. So many times I need to go into a situation where I use my inside elbow like so to start taking my knee across the three quarter mount. My partner puts a butterfly hook in like so and now she starts extending me. I go to start stepping over, she blocks me with the hand. Anytime she goes to post to my knee, that's the time now to make a conversion to double under hooks and now from here we can start going in and passing as we want to. So whenever my hips are low, I play a dilemma game between freeing my knee as she goes to post, I pommel my under hook in and then we make a conversion from near side to double under hooks and that's what we want to be when we're looking for our prime passing positions. Okay, with double under hooks is always better so we make a conversion to double under hooks. Alright, or when in a situation where we go into a high tripod, we look to start going in, we look to start putting a butterfly hook in, passing, we free the knee, she goes to post to my knee, I let her push it back down into half guard and now from here we back track into our partner's leg and we go in and this time we go back into our partner's guard but on our own terms. This time instead of having one under hook, we have two under hooks and now we can start to go in and work from here. Okay, so we play a game between freeing our knee and exposing the under hook on the far side. So, this time my partner stops me from freeing my knee by posting on it, we just pommel a second under hook in, convert to double unders and now we have a much better passing position than just having the far side or the near side under hook. Alright, so now we're spending a little bit of time on body lock passing and we looked at getting to half guard with body locks from the body locking instructional, now we're going to look at passing from half guard. Now that we know all of the pommels from half guard, all the leg pommeling, all the head position, body position, it's relatively similar to regular half guard passing just with control, much more control over your partner's hips. Now we're going to run into ways to actually pass half guard to either side with both body locks underneath both our partner's arms and a body lock with one of our partner's arms trapped where my partner gets an under hook, we lock over the arm and go into passes to either side or into mount. Alright so now let's look at the difference between controlling my partner's hips and controlling my partner's head and shoulder and why would I do one versus the other. Well maybe sometimes I force up, I go to a body lock, I step over into half guard and maybe my partner has such good inside position at the upper body, the elbows and the hands are so tight that I can't move to make a cranial shift and move to control my partner's head and shoulders. So the first reason is the obvious where I lock a body lock and I just can't get to control my partner's head and shoulders. Now let's say I have the option to move to the head and shoulders but I'm not sure which one I want to do. Do I want to stay with the body lock and go for passes or do I want to make a transition where I move from the waist to the shoulders and control my partner's head. What are the pluses and minuses to both and why would I use one versus the other? Understand that when you start in a body lock and you pass your partner's guard, you have far more control over your partner's hips which means that it's usually a lot easier to get past the legs. So I end up in a situation where we pass our partner with a body lock, we get past our partner's legs much easier from here. The problem is once I get past my partner's legs, now my partner is no longer worried about defending the pass anymore. So the problem now is a very centralized problem in one area. My partner only has to worry about me making a cranial shift. So before I can actually go into attacks on my partner, I have to make a transition now from my partner's waist up to the head. And in many instances, this is a very hard thing to do because now your partner is only worried about one thing. So when I actually try to make that cranial shift, my partner will bring elbows and hands back inside, knees to elbows and then she'll recover. A perfect example of this is when you saw me competing against Hamil overhaul in 2017 ADCC. I didn't have the actual knowledge to make the cranial shift and I ended up recovering. So while when you're passing with the body lock, you have much more control over your partner's hips. Once you actually pass their guard, it'll be much harder to actually make a cranial shift. Okay? So you have a much easier time passing their legs, so it's hard for them to move the hips and pommel, but a harder time actually going to control over the head after you pass and getting control over your partner's limbs and going into submissions or moving to your back partner's back, wherever the case is. Now when you're passing, if you move from a body lock, let's say a transition from a body lock, step over into half guard, I transitioned to a body lock and I moved to a top head and arm. All right. Why would I do that? Understand that your partner now has a lot more ability to pommel their legs, to move their hips and to play a leg pommel in game with you. Okay? But if you do pass your partner's legs and get past their guard, now you immediately have control of your partner's upper body. You have control of the head and shoulders. You likely have one arm elevated already and you can start going immediately into attacking positions where there's no, there's no time now between you passing and going into attacks. Whereas before, if you just pass the body lock, now you have to make a transition to controlling the head and shoulders before you can go into attacks. Okay? So your partner has more ability to pommel the legs and off balance you. But if you do pass, you're in a much better position because you control the head and the shoulders. So that leads me to the question, why would I use one versus the other? In general, if I'm dealing with someone who is an exceptional leg pommeler, who puts butterfly hooks in and has an incredible ability to off balance you and just get feet and knees to the inside to off balance you with sumo gaeshi's and to give you hell when you're flattening someone out in half guard. If I'm dealing with someone who's very good at off balancing me, I generally prefer, this is a very general statement, I generally prefer to stay on the body lock and pass the legs first then work, work later on getting control of the head and shoulders. If, on the other hand, I find that I flatten a guy out and maybe my half guard passing is so, so good or my partner's just not very good at pommeling their legs and you know that if you can flatten them out then it's going to be pretty easy to pass them, then I will generally try to make a cranial shift before I pass my partner's legs. So I'll go from body lock and then I'll move right to the head and shoulders and look to control my partner. So in general, if my partner's doing a very good job of leg pommeling, where I know that from here if I get to the top head and arm, my partner's going to put a butterfly hook in, she's going to off balance me in one direction, off balance me in the other direction, bring the knee back inside, start going into attack, and I feel like man it's just, it's hard, even if I get chaff to chaff from this guy, it's hard to pass it. Then in general, I'll stick with the body lock until I start to pass from here. Now when she goes to put my butterfly hook in and she goes to start off balancing me from here, it's a hard thing. I can start to go in and scroll past my partner's leg and beat my partner pretty easily from here, okay? And if I feel like I can easily flatten my partner out and I can easily win a leg pommeling battle, then I'll usually just move right from the body lock to control my partner's head and shoulders and then once I'm passed, it's pretty easy to think to pass. I feel like it's an easy thing to beat them. In the leg pommeling battle, I pass, I have one or two arms isolated, then I can go right into attacking positions, okay? So the body lock itself gives you far more control, gives you far more control over your partner's hips, but makes it harder to go into attacks once you're passing the legs. Whereas if you move to your partner's head and shoulder before you pass, now it's much harder to beat them at the leg pommeling battle, but if you do, once you pass, you're already into a situation where you're most likely ready to attack with an arm control, two-armed control, a strong cross face in, then you can start to work much easier from there. So just a general rule with working at the hips with the body lock versus working at the head and shoulders with any kind of upper body position. Now let's look at locking a body lock from half guard. Now of course we can lock a body lock from a standing position versus seated guard, anytime my partner's seated versus kneeling, and we can step over into a half guard. But we can also lock a body lock from a half guard. And the easiest way to do this is whenever I see my partner's back is off the floor and my partner's waist is exposed, you can go into body locks, okay? Now a few more prerequisites to this body lock. You obviously can't go into your partner's frames and expect to lock a body lock against a knee shield and be able to keep your hand locked. Now she just extends and separates my arms, okay? So the two things we have to look for is number one, can I get past my partner's frames? If I can get past my partner's frames, is my partner's upper back on or off the floor? If her upper back is on the floor, now it's time to crash the far shoulder or switch to an over back grip. If her upper back is off the floor and I can get past my partner's frames, I can sit to the over back, I can go near to the under hook, I can do all those things, but I can also go in because my partner's waist is exposed, I can go through and I can lock onto that body lock like so. Okay, so anytime my partner goes to sit up towards me, usually a lot of times it's when my partner goes to come up towards me and goes into shooting to an under hook, whatever the case is, we just go through, we lock up and over our partner's waist like so. Or as my partner goes to sit up towards me, she gets an under hook and I'm playing a game where I'm hand fighting here and I go to follow into an under hook, but instead of crashing the far shoulder this time I just go in and we just go through and we lock into our partner's body like so. So anytime my partner has waist exposure where I can get my two hands underneath her very easily, we can go in and we can lock up our partner's body. We can also use a method where once we get past our partner's top leg, let's say from here we get past our partner's top leg, from this position we come through and from here we looked at climbing up to our partner's upper body and making that cranial shift before. We can also play a game where right from here we just shovel our hands underneath. Where I start lifting with my right elbow and I just pull my partner's back off the floor and I shoot into initial tight waist. Now once I have this tight waist in place, I just lift my elbow and we put that arm through and now from here we go in and we start locking our hands in body type scenarios. Now understand for those of you who watched the body lock passing instructional, there's an arbitrary line that's being drawn between locked and unlocked hands. So understand that when I lock from half guard I can play a game between tight waist passing and body lock passing. We'll look at that in a second. But the body lock passing, whether you have centered hands or use long arm, short arm, closed hands, open hands, they're all very similar in terms of pommeling and body and head position as tight waist pass, as half guard passing when we use either double underhooks and we control the head and the shoulders or if we use tight waisting like so, this is going to be very similar to using a far side underhook and a head block. If we use a near side tight waist, the pommels will be very similar to using a near side underhook with a head on the floor like so or a near side underhook with a high tri-pump like so. So these are very very closely related as far as body position and leg pommels to upper body half guard passing where I'm chest to chest and I'm controlling my partner's head and shoulders. So we can look at body lock passing with hands centered or we can look at long arm, short arm with tight waist on one side or tight waist on the other side. So we can use far side tight waist, near side tight waist or centered hands, body lock passing. The easiest way to expose body locks is when my partner's upper back is off the floor and the waist is exposed. If the waist isn't exposed, we can expose it by physically lifting, getting one hand through, lifting, getting a second hand through and then from here we have good control over our partner's hips where we can go and start our passing. Or we can use this to start creating pressure towards the pass and then make a cranial shift somewhere in between the leg pommeling and my partner trying to defend. Maybe she opens up her hands, start posting on my knees and then if I want to go to the head and shoulders, I can. Whereas a lot of times if I just am trying to make the upper body shift right, the cranial shift right now, I can't do it. So I go in and we look to start exposing a body lock. Now we go into a high tripod, we start bringing a knee free, she posts on a knee and now from here we go in, we start getting to upper body transitions where we can get chest to chest and start controlling my partner's head and shoulders should I want to do that. Okay. So body lock is a great way to pass our partner. It's also a great way to make a transition and make your partner open up, posting on knees and getting to the head and shoulders before you pass your partner's legs. Okay. So when we're passing with a body lock from a traditional half guard and our partner has the legs locked in a triangle, think about it as the same pommels as you would use if you're passing with a double underhook scenario. Because my hands are locked underneath both my partner's arms, I have symmetrical positions passing to both sides. When I have double underhooks, no matter which side I pass to, I'm going to end up in the same upper body position. It's the same thing with a body lock, you're just lower on your partner's torso. Okay. So whenever I go into this body lock passing, I can play with my head on both sides. It doesn't really make a difference from here. Okay. So again, I lock my hands in the center and now from here I go to start high tripodting. Whether I go to the far shoulder, like so, I high tripod, I palm the butterfly hook in. I high tripod and from here I walk, walk, walk, knees up. I walk, walk, walk. I take my knees across and I pass. I go in, I come up. Maybe I go to the near shoulder this time. I go in, I high tripod. She doesn't start moving me around. We go in and we start passing. Okay. So we play the same game that we would play if we had double underhooks. Now the exception to this is that because you're lower on your partner's hips, it's going to be harder to hit one of the pommels and that's a front pommel because you don't really have the extension that you need. You don't have the ability to start lifting your partner's arms up and above the head. Your body is usually too crunched up in order to hit the front pommel. So if I play a game, my partner has a butterfly hook in place and I try to start playing a game where I pommel a butterfly hook in and I got to come forward and I try to top pommel. I can't do it. If I try to front pommel, you see how it's hard from here? My own elbow stops me from pommeling. That's a pretty hard thing to do. Whereas if I have double underhooks, now I've got a front pommel, I can get my hips up nice and high and the front pommel is easy. The bad news is that it's harder for you to hit front pommels when you have your hands locked a little bit lower. But the good news is because you have such control over your partner's hips, that the game you're going to be playing from here is a much simpler one. When your partner uses a butterfly hook from half guard, I lock my hands. The game that I'll be playing from here is once I pommel my butterfly hook in, my partner goes to follow me with the light pommels and I just sprawl past my partner's butterfly hook. Once you get to keep a hook, it's so hard for my partner to follow me because of the fact that I have such control over my partner's hips that you don't even have to waste your time with going in and trying to top pommel, front pommel, things like that. It'll be harder to do, but you have such control over your partner's legs that it's the easiest thing in the world to just put a butterfly hook in, put your own butterfly hook in and hit a quick hip switch past your partner's legs. So treat this, treat the pommels as though you are pommeling from double underhooks. You can hit all the same pommels that you would hit from a double underhook position, but this time you have much more control over your partner's hips. A general game I'll play, and I'll usually just try to insert my own butterfly hook and use sprawling methods to just quickly hip switch past my partner's butterfly hook. And that's more than enough to get past 99% of people's guards, butterfly half guards in the world, including the best guys in the world. But you can use various pommels from here. You can hit the same pommels that you hit from the double underhook position. And once you actually do get past your partner's guard, now you have to make a cranial shift. Now you have to worry about your partner keeping everything in tight and actually getting control over the head and shoulders. So once I actually pass into this position here and my partner has everything in tight like so, it's hard to make a cranial shift. If I just randomly open up my arms and come forward, she's going to bring everything inside. So from this position, generally what I look to do is I look to switch to a far side tight waist here like so. So now from this position, my partner goes to keep everything inside. It's an easy thing for her to keep everything inside, but for how long? It's a time-based game. Can she keep my cross face from coming in long enough until she can move out and away and shrimp away from me? If I just go in and my hand's here, she shrimps away and recovers. But because I switched to a far side tight waist like so, when she goes to recover from this position, she can't move away from me. So from here, I play a game where it's just a waiting game. The first thing I do is I take, she usually has a cross shoulder post in place and she usually has a hand in the inside bicep. First thing I do is I take my head and my chin and I cover my partner's cross shoulder post and I just drag it down towards my partner's hips. The cross shoulder post will stop me from coming forward and crashing the far shoulder. But what it won't do is stop me from pulling it down and away like so. Now from here, I get my head in the way so my partner goes to use the cross shoulder post to monitor my arm, which is a difficult thing to do. Now from here, I start playing a game where I go up and I go down. I go up and I go down. And then from here I can go and I can start lifting. So I play a trial and error game between going up to get to the cross face, down to get to the cross face, and lifting to get a hand to the inside. So she goes to beat me in a pommeling battle, she does for one second, three seconds, five seconds, ten seconds, and then eventually we come through, we get to a control over our partner's head with a cross face, and now from here we have a choice of what we want to do. We can stay in this position or we can move to an inside bicep tie when we feel comfortable and make a true transition to a cranial shift and look to start controlling our partner from here. Okay? So one great option, we pass our partner's guard, we get past our partner's legs with this body lock, and now we have to make a cranial shift. How can we do this? When I see this, we're actually past our partner's legs, the first thing we do, my partner goes to move away, we just shoot a far side tight waisted nice and deep. She goes to start stripping away, it's going to be hard now. From here I control my partner's cross shoulder post with my head position, and now we just play a waiting game. She goes to strip away, she doesn't have enough time to stop me, and we can eventually go through, get control of our partner's head, and start winning this battle from here. Okay? So that's one. Two, conversely, she has elbows in tight, like so. From here, whenever I see this, we can come through, we take that same far side tight waist, this time we take our hand right up the middle, and from this position we just sit through, we take our elbow through like so. So that now, when my partner goes to start stripping away, I let her go. And as she goes to move away, we just go and we block our partner's hip with our hand. And this time instead of forcing a transition to side control, where we have to control our partner's head and shoulders in order to actually get to a pin and a pass, this time we move to north south, where there's no need for a cranial shift. So as she goes to strip away, I just glue my ear to the far hip, I put her head between my two legs, and I make a transition to north south instead. So whenever I feel like for whatever reason I don't want to pass to side control, or I can't pass to side control, I can't control my partner's head, after I pass my partner's legs, go to north south because you don't need to make a cranial shift to north south. Okay? So from here, she brings everything in, I switch to a tight waist. This time I can't go to the cross face, but as she goes to raise everything up, I just go and I go to the inside position like so. I take my hand through and I sit here. Now right from here, she goes to start moving around, I wait until she makes a bridge big enough for me to easily slip, go ahead, my hand free. And now when she goes to move me around, I just shoot my ear to my partner's far hip. When she has to recover from here, because of my head position, shoulder position, it's a pretty easy thing to maintain the inside position, move to north south, and now we don't need control of our partner's head and shoulders. We have two great options, one, use a far side tight waist to fight to the inside position, get to the head, and then pull everything in and then either stay with a tight waist or move to an inside bicep tie, or if we feel like we can't make a cranial shift, move to north south. Because passing to north south is the one exception where you don't need to have direct control over your partner's head and shoulders to actually get to a top pin and start to attack your partner. So now let's quickly cover tight waist passing where we initially lock to the body and then we go into tight waist pass. What? Let's quickly cover it. 30 minutes probably. It's getting late, right Sunny? Let's quickly do this. All right, sure. 15 minutes later. All right. So just, just understand that when you go to a tight waist, you will have again, more control over your partner's hips, but, and it will be hard for your partner to pummel legs, but it will be, it'll be a much harder to actually get to a cranial shift once you actually pass your partner. Okay. So if I get to a body lock, we can play with a far side tight waist, or we can play with a near side tight waist. All right. And you're going to treat these pommels the same as you would. You're going to treat these passes the same as you would if you're using a far side under hook and a near side head block or a near side under hook up at your partner's upper body. Okay. So the pommels will remain the same. So if I'm here and I have a near side under hook, I'm going to be looking to go in and start using this to start using an inside elbow position. Or I'm going to start going in and start using this to high tripod. If I have a near side tight waist, like so, I'm going to start using this to go in and I'm going to start walking across and looking to get my legs out like so. Or I'm going to start looking to go in, I use this near side tight waist to start going forward, cratching my partner's far shoulder. And I start using this to start going into a high tripod. And now from here we go in and we start pommeling. Okay. So we use the same pommels as we would if we had near side under hook. Same thing if we have a far side tight waist. If I have a far side under hook with a head block, we go in and we start playing a game. We look to start going up and pommeling our legs however it may be. Okay. If we have a far side tight waist, once again, same deal. This time we go in, we use that far side tight waist to start going forward towards our partner. Now from here we start going up, we start using that to go in, beating our partner and we use that to start going in. You can pommel with butterfly hooking maybe. We start going in, we start passing. We go in and we start passing. Okay. So we use that near side or far side tight waist just as we would the near side or the far side under hook. Okay. Now once we actually pass our partner's legs, it's a little bit different because now we have a tight waist, we don't have control of our partner's head and shoulder. So if we pass with a far side tight waist like so, everything that we just did is going to be the same regarding getting to a cranial shift. Because now instead of having my hands locked and having to unlock them, we have unlocked hands and we just go forward and we get to our partner's head or we transition to north south. If I pass with a near side tight waist, I have a couple of different options from here. Okay. One is I can lock my hands from this position and I can physically switch to a far side tight waist where I can just go and I can lock my hands. I can just quickly circle towards my partner's hips and we can hit a slight lifting action with our left elbow and just shoot to a far side tight waist, make a conversion and then go in and start passing our partner. Okay. What we can also do is we can play a game where if we can get inside our partner's far elbow at any point, we play a game where we go through and we start getting to an inside bicep tie, coming forward and crashing the far shoulder. Now once you get us to recover from here, I just stay circling towards the hips and then we either go in with under hook on our near side under hook on our partner and now go in and convert double under hooks or we go in, we get to that inside bicep tie, we go over our partner's arm, switch to standard top head and arm and go into our same pommels from here. Okay. So if whatever reason I feel like I can't get inside my partner's upper body and I have this near side under hook and from here she goes in and now it's a difficult thing for me to start going inside. Normally what I do is if I'm not going to switch to the far side tight waist, I'll just start walking my partner's legs away from me and from this position I either one, just step into my partner's legs and I backtrack. So when she goes to trap my legs, I keep a knee elbow connection. She goes to start backtrack or go start trapping my leg, she can't trap my knee. And now from here I slide the three quarter mount on the opposite side and I start passing from there. Okay. That makes it pretty easy thing to start going in and either passing from three quarter mount or I can switch my head position. I can slide my knee across, shoot my leg out and now I've made a conversion to a far side tight waist where now from here I can move to a far side under hook and go in and start to pass. Or what I'll have to start doing is circling my partner's legs out and away and then just using post my partner's legs like so. But now from here I can start going in, creating some leg riding action, start pummeling over my partner's legs and she goes to start opening up her legs from here. It's a pretty easy thing for me to start going in, pummeling in various situations where I can go in and either mount or go up to side control on the opposite side. Okay. So when you're passing with near side and far side tight waist, you will treat the pommels to pass your partner's guard the same as you would as if you're working with a near side under hook or just a far side under hook. The problem is when you actually pass your partner's legs, now things are different because now you don't have control over your partner's upper body. So the pommels to pass remain the same, but the pommels after you pass are much different. So this is a way to pass your partner's guard converting from a body lock to a tight waist and then once you have the tight waist using either near side or far side to make the cranial shift once you pass the legs. All right. Now let's look at actually locking over our partner's arm and getting a body lock in place. All right. So this is going to be a little bit different now because of the fact that you don't have symmetrical hand positions when you pass. If you pass to one side, you're passing onto an under hook. If you pass to the other side, you're passing onto your under hook. Okay. So this time, again, anytime my partner goes to shoot forward towards me and I can create that waist exposure, we can go in and we can lock body lock. Okay. Now from this position, my partner has the arm extended towards me. She's trying to go into an under hook. So if I go to lock my hands and she has the inside position, we lock over the hands like so. Okay. If I have the inside position, I lock underneath both arms. Okay. So that anytime that she has an under hook and I can crush the under hook low enough to get a connection of my hands. Now from here we can go in and we can start locking our hands with a body lock. All right. And I'm not gonna spend too much time obviously talking about the lock of the hands with body lock, but we can use 10 finger, palm to palm and wrist to wrist. We spoke about this in the body locking instructional. So it's all in there if you're looking for more body locking stuff. We go in, this time we lock up and over our partner's arms. Okay. Now understand when we lock over one of our partner's arms, if I pass to the near side, I'm passing onto my partner's under hook. So the second I go to unlock my hands from here, she uses the under hook to sort of off balancing me. Whereas if I pass to the opposite side, now I'm passing to the correct side with my under hook. So when she goes to use her under hook to off balance, maybe she just pulls me into a cross face. All right. So you have to be cognizant of this difference when you're passing with the arm inside. Okay. What we can also do, if at any point we go in and we flatten our partner out from this position and I feel like my partner's arm is trapped inside, we can always go in and we can use a near side wedge with our hand to wedge our hand through as a near side tight waist. Then we can go in and we can lock over our partner's arm or she can start to pull the arm out and if she pulls the arm out and we just convert it to two arms underneath. Okay. So this time we go in, my partner goes to come towards me, she has to put the under hook in place. We stop the under hook and we just go through, we expose the waist, we lock our partner's arm in place. Now from here, we just go in and we crash the far shoulder like we always do. So once you use the under hook to start sitting up, it's a pretty easy thing to open my left elbow, close my right elbow. Once you guys use that under hook, you just crash your far shoulder, flatten my partner out with the body lock and now we can go in and start going into pass from here. All right. So now let's look at passing options when we have that far side arm trapped inside of a body lock and we're in half guard. Okay. So first of all, when I lock into a body lock in this position, what I generally recommend is to flatten my partner out with the body lock, but then to start moving into situations where I use just a near side under hook. When I have my partner's arm trapped inside the body lock, yes, you have more control of your partner's hips, but you now have both your hands occupied with the body lock. So in general, what I'm going to recommend is when you lock your partner's far arm in place, flatten them out and then transition either to a near side under hook or a near side tight waist. Okay. That gives you the ability to use a free hand to push your partner's far knee down and start to step over and bring your knee free. All right. So it's going to make everything easier if you have unlocked hands for this one, but it's not imperative that you do unlock your hands. Some people lock their hands and they're like, oh man, I can't separate my hands. Otherwise the guy's going to escape, but that's not the case if you have proper body position. So what I recommend is I flatten my partner out and I just move to a situation where now when she goes to use the under hook, it's just as effective for her as if it was locked to her body with the body lock. She has no ability to use the under hook. And now I have to luxury this free hand from base. I've luxury this free hand to post my partner's knee and look to start bringing my knee free. All right. So that's always my number one thing is I'll always look to do that. Now provided you want to actually pass with the arm trapped in place. When I see this, I'm going to look to start going in and I'm going to look to start crashing my partner's far shoulder. The problem is now if I start going to my partner's near shoulder, your partner can start using the under hook to start hiking up and start exposing your back from here. So what I always want to do if I trap my partner's far arm in place, is I always want to keep weight over the far shoulder and keep the under hook crushed. So now when I go to crash the far shoulder and she has to use that under hook to start moving me around is impossible. If I crashed a near shoulder, she tilts to the correct shoulder and I get stifled from here. So we go in and we crush the under hook down by going to the far shoulder. Now when she goes to move anywhere from this position, we just go in and we start high tripodding up. And now from here we play the same game we looked to play before. But from here we go through and we start going in and passing. If we pass to the near side, again, my partner is going to start using that under hook when we go to unlock our hands. But because of the fact that we have a near side hand on the inside position, it's a pretty easy thing to secondly pass and start going in and sliding up to shin mount. Where now from here we can go through and we can pass right into a mounted position. Or we can go in and start sliding across to the opposite side. Of course generally, because we're passing and my partner has a far side under hook, I generally recommend passing right into mount or passing to the far side. Not to say you can't pass to the near side, but it's much easier and safer to pass right into mount or to the far side. So we go in, we play with all those pommels that we love so much. We're going to be treating this as we're passing with a near side under hook. So the pommels all remain the same, besides the fact that we can't front pommel from here because we don't have the range. So we can go in, we can come up, slide across, can pass. She pommels a butterfly hook in, we can top pommel, and pass. Most of the time we're going to be going in and sprawling. That's our partner's butterfly hook. And now from here, the second she goes to make a recovery, we go in and we pass. So we're going to be treating this body lock with one arm in as though we're passing with either a near side tight waist or passing with a near side under hook. You can pass to the near side, but usually we're passing into mount or we're passing to the far side, then we have the under hook on the correct side. So very, very similar to leg pommels are all the same. This time we just have hands connected. We have our partner's forearm trapped and we can start passing with the far side body lock. Or we got the far side body lock with the near side under hook to the far side. All right, so we got roughly 13 hours of technique here and we have probably between an hour and a half and two hours they usually are of rolling commentary. So this should be between 14 and 15 hours of half guard passing here. And now I hope you guys see why I had to split up the passing 2.0 into multiple passing series because there's just so much more information that there is to learn about passing than the one that I just, I gave you guys as the first one. So of course we started going in and we went from getting past our partner's top leg. Now partner can have either a high knee shield, a low knee shield, or a butterfly hook. We have to be able to address those legs and it's pretty basic getting past those top legs. But I know a lot of you are watching this are lower belts and for my white belt, blue belt and even like most of my purple belt journey, everyone plays half guard. Ricardo is known for half guard, Hanzo, Tom are all known for half guard. So we had a big half guard team and getting past that top leg and that top arm were like a nightmare for me. So I want to spend a lot of time on getting past those top frames, the top leg and the top arm and getting chest to chest. We look at two major ways to get past the frames. We either look at crashing the far shoulder if we can get past the frames and flattening your partner out as a half guard or going to an overback series to either pass from an overback series or flatten our partner out off of the initial overback grip. Okay. And those are super, super important. If you can't come linear into your partner and crash the far shoulder, you have to hip switch past the far, past the top leg as you go to clear the cross shoulder post or whatever upper body posting grip your partner has on you. All right. So we use overback grips or crashing the far shoulder to get chest to chest. Now once we get chest to chest, it's very interesting because there are many upper body grips that you can use. There's many different body positions and pommels you can use. And your responsibility as a student is to know what pommel I'm supposed to use, what body positioning I'm supposed to use, and what upper body hand positions I'm supposed to use at any given time and the reasons why I'm supposed to use them. Why would I use a cross face here versus the top head and arm here? Or why would I use a head block here versus a double underhooks here? And there are certain positions that you can end up in where one works and the other one doesn't. Okay. So we look at general hierarchy of hand positions. Then we looked at many pommels to start passing. And then we looked at our opponent going into all four attacks from underhook, deep half guard, things like that. And then we finished off finally with near side underhook and body lock passing. And once you actually get the pommeling and the hand positions down from a top half guard passing, body locking from half guard becomes much easier because all the pommels are relatively the same. Okay. With one, you have much more control over the hips through the pass, so it's much easier to pass the legs. And the other one, you have more control over the head and shoulders, meaning it's harder to get past the legs. But once you do, you're already in a position ready to attack. Okay. So once we get past the legs from a body lock, now we have to look at ways to pommel to get the upper body cranial shift or move into north-south to start going into all of our attacks. And we looked at ways to do that. Okay. So a lot of information here. It's going to take a long time to go over and master, but I wanted to give you guys the information and I wanted to give you not only how to do this, but why would I do this? Why would I use one versus the other? Why would I use a certain upper body grip versus a different upper body grip? Why would I use body locking versus making a cranial shift and going in for passing? Okay. Because everyone teaches the moves, but no one teaches the theory and the reasoning behind why they use one move versus the other. So I wanted to make that the focus of today's instructional. So hopefully you guys enjoyed it. This will be probably released in June, half guard passing. So we're here filming it in April. I'm done until ADCC. So you guys get this one and then one more after ADCC, which is already filmed. So hopefully you guys enjoy that. It's passing 2.0, I believe. And upper body joint lock escapes and passing 2.0 you guys will get. So hopefully you guys enjoy that and let me know what you think about it. Thank you obviously to Fanatics and Placido and Randy for being here all through all hours of the night. Helping me record and writing down notes and fixing my mess ups. And obviously thank you to a little Miss Heisani who's just been complaining this entire time. This is the longest we've been here for filming. We've been here for 10 days now and we've filmed a little bit over 20 hours of content. So usually we come and we film like four to six, maybe eight, 10 hours most. This was a 20 hour one because I didn't want to have to come back before ADCC because I'm getting ready to beat everybody up. So it's been a long 10 days and you held in there. You're a real trooper. And now what are you going to do? I'm going to spend your money. I'm going to spend my money, right? She gets paid for being okay, but she never sees it because why? Because he says that I already spent their money. So it's already gone. Comes to me, but she already spent it two months ago, so it just comes right to me instead. All right. Thanks guys. Hopefully you enjoyed.
