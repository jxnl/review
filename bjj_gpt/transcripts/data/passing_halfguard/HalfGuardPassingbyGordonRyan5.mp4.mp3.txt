 All right, so, it's the first clip of the day. Sunny's freezing and she has socks on for this clip. So that's about it. Okay, we're going to look at going into a basic pass now from a top-headed arm into side control and dominating the inside hip with our knee. Now, the first thing we have to look at is inserting a butterfly hook. My partner can give me some difficulties inserting a butterfly hook and we'll look at ways to insert a butterfly hook on a talented opponent in a second. Right now we're going to assume we can insert a butterfly hook, we'll have to look at a specific way to do this. So she's going to be flattened out in half guard with a top-headed arm, like so. From this position I always look to get my elbows as wide and as high as I can. The first thing I'm going to do before I go into a high tripod is I'm going to attempt to crash my partner's far shoulder. I'm going to look to open my elbows up to get my elbows to or above my partner's shoulder line. This is obviously the ideal position we want to be in, where my elbows are far out and away from each other, one another, and well above my partner's shoulder line. But we can't always get this. So when she's pulling the elbow down and she's moving her arm, I just bring my elbows up as high as I can. And now from here I take my forehead down to the floor over my partner's far shoulder. I put a strong cross face in place. From here I first start by pulling my elbow down to my partner's shoulder. So I take my left elbow, I pull it down into my partner's shoulder like so, and now I lean forward into the cross face and put my head on the floor. You get a very tight wedging effect. If I just lean forward, you get a decent cross face, but it's much tighter by first pulling my elbow down into my partner's shoulder. This will give you a perfect purchase on your partner's jaw and allow you to put a strong cross face in place. And now from here, we go into a high tripod, where I take my forehead down to the floor with nice wide elbows and we go into this high tripod position. She'll be locking her legs above my knee, like so. And now you see from here, it's a hard thing to pull my leg to the inside position. So from here I walk to the side that I want to pass. I'm looking to pass to the near side. So I take my right knee to my partner's right hip, like so. Now when she has to point her knee up, it's not easy. We take a butterfly hook in like so, we place shoelaces here on our partner's calf muscle. And now we just shake, shake, shake, and we push. The second the knee comes free beyond my partner's knee line, we put our knee down on the floor like so. And now from here we play a game. We look to start opening our left elbow and bring our partner's head out and away from her hips. From this position, when she goes to move around, it's not an easy thing from here. Now my forehead comes off the floor. My forehead stays on the floor from here and she goes to bridge me over, she can get me off balance from here. So my forehead comes off the floor from this position. From here, I take my foot to my partner's top leg. The big mistake everyone makes from here is they try to knee slide out in this direction, which will free the leg and allow your partner to lock the side guard. This is not what I want. So from here, instead we go in, we use a very specific way of clearing my leg free. I post on my partner's top leg to free my heel. If I just post randomly and try to pull my leg free, I won't be able to do it. So I free my heel by posting my partner's top leg, like so. And now I free the rest of my foot by posting my partner's bottom leg. So now when she goes to lock side guard, she can't. My legs and hips are in the way. Now she goes to recover, I keep my hips staggered, I just walk back towards my partner's hips like so. And now from here when she goes to recover, her knees are pointing in the opposite direction of me. I have a flared left elbow and it's very difficult for my partner to start going into any offense or recoveries from here. So we go in, we go to a high tripod first. From here, we lock up with a top-headed arm, whatever grip you may want. We look to get the elbows as high as we can. We start leaning towards the far shoulder, we open the elbows. We pull our elbow down into our partner's shoulder, like so. Then we lean forward and we go into a high tripod with our forehead on the floor like so. From this position, she has her leg locked up high above my knee. It's hard for me to palm my leg inside. So from here, I walk to the side to angle my partner's knees towards the leg I want to insert. That leg goes in. Because I'm on a high tripod, if she tries to bridge from here, it'll have no effect. If she goes to lock in from this position, we take our butterfly hook into place. Now from here, we just shake, shake, shake. Knee goes to the floor. I take my elbow and I open it like so to elongate my partner's body. Now she goes to hold on tight. I do not slide out in this direction and allow knee to elbow connection and slide guard to come into place. Instead, I slide my knee towards my partner's armpit straight up along her body. So from here, we go in, knee slides up as high as we can. We post here, my partner's top leg. She goes to hold on tight. She goes to hold on tight. Heel comes out first. The rest of the foot follows. She goes to lock side guard. We can make a pass into a nice top strong pin right from there. So once again, we come in, we go to a high tripod. Elbows come high. We pull the elbow back to get a strong bite in the cross face. Now we start to go into a high tripod. As we go into a high tripod, we initially, another detail, we initially turn our right hip slightly down. We don't want our partner to insert our left knee inside of our hip. As a knee shield, I use that to make space, push me backwards, pummel hands inside or bump the hook inside and go into attacks. When I go into a high tripod, I turn my right knee down. So when she goes to insert that knee, it's not easy. She can get a small purchase, but she can't get a huge knee inside. The big purchase on my hip pushed me away. So I immediately turn my hip and I walk. But she gets to put a knee shield in now, it's not easy. And now from here, they pummel that butterfly hook in. She goes to start moving me around. Knee comes to the floor. I open up the elbow. I push top leg first, bottom leg second. She goes to move around and recover. I get solidified top pin and go to work from topside control. The dominating the inside knee, going into a high tripod properly and making a basic pass into side control like we've all seen before, just with a few extra details that are going to allow you to pass against higher level people. All right, so that was our basic high tripod into a pass to side control. Now we're going to high tripod and pass into mount. So let's take a look at dominating our partner's outside hip now with this knee. She's going to be down in the mount or in the bottom half guard. I'm going to have her flatten out the top head and arm. And again, we're going to go to that same high tripod. We're from here, we lean forward, elbows come up, elbow comes back, forehead comes down. I'm moving to the high tripod and again, we insert our butterfly hook like so. Now from here, instead of taking my knee to my partner's inside hip, I just take it right here. I dominate my partner's outside hip. Now from this position, you can kind of float around. Your partner goes to move you around from here. It's not an easy thing at all. And now whenever you're ready, we just go in and we slide the knee down to our partner's outside hip. We start dominating that outside hip now. Your partner will be trying most of the time to push your knee down from the outside position, push the knee down and re-trap you in half guard. So the second I land in this position, I immediately take my head to my partner's center line. As I take my head to my partner's center line, I open up my right elbow like so. Now from here, when she has to start pushing that knee down, there's no way. When she has to start moving around, she's fully elongated, there's no way. And now from here, I just plant my forehead on the floor. At any point, she has to start bridging and moving around from here. You just won't be able to take my knee off the hip. I keep tension running through my partner's hip by extending my knee down towards my partner's legs like so. What I don't want is for her to point her knees, even if she can't post my leg with her hand, if she can extend her knees and point your knees, good, point your knees in the opposite direction, good. Now from here, she can bring her legs up and trap. So I keep constant tension running through the hip. So if she has to start pointing her knees and bringing her knee up, she can't do it. And now whenever you're ready, we put a butterfly hook back in. We use that butterfly hook to free our leg to take two feet inside. Now the choice is yours whether you want to pummel across the side control or as your partner goes to move around, you pummel right into mount and we're ready to go in and start attacking from top mounted position. So from here, we go in and we start taking our head down to the floor. As our head comes down to the floor, we go into a high tripod, we expose a butterfly hook. This time we go in, instead of going near hip, we go far hip. From this position, she has to move me around. It's not an easy thing. Now the knee comes down to the floor like so. The second my knee comes down to the floor, I immediately take my head back to center and I take my elbow up high. When she has to move me around and push my knee down from here, which is not going to happen. And now from here we take that foot to the inside, we free our knee and now we can pummel in a variety of different ways to a variety of different positions or attacks. This time we're going to look at a different way of mounting, a little bit more advanced way, where I pass 95% of the way to a side control and then I use two butterfly hooks to step back into my partner's legs and then feed across into mount. This is good for threatening a pass to side control, making your partner use more energy to stop you from passing, and then passing right across to mount instead so they can't form a side guard as you pass to a side control. What it also does is it stops your opponent from using that escape that everyone likes to do where you pass their guard and they use this knee-side underhook to start spinning out and going into escapes. Okay, so take a look at why this is so effective and why it's so important to know as we go through it. So, she's going to be down like so, we go into this high tripod and we start going into a situation where you put a butterfly hook in and we start going in to pass our partner. Now from this position, she has my legs trapped, I go in and I free my top leg like so. Once I free my top leg, or once I free my heel, I'm just going to take my butterfly hook back to the inside position. Once my heel is free, your partner no longer has control over your legs. So what they're going to start doing from here is they're going to start accepting the pass and the knees will start to open. Whenever I see this, as the knees are going to start to open, most people either give up a big bridge, which we'll look at in a second, or what they do is they take their feet to the floor like so, and from here they look to take their hand through underneath and start spinning as you go to circle towards the head, they circle out in the opposite direction and they move out of the way. So the second your heel comes free, you can expect some kind of defensive response and explosive reaction to try to hit a last-ditch recovery. So I go in, I free my heel, the legs unlock, and from here I just take two butterfly hooks behind my partner's legs like so. When she goes to start going into that near side underhook escape, she can't because she can't move her leg away from me. And now from here, I just play a game where I go back into a high tripod and I just move my two knees to my partner's two hips. So when she goes to move me around, I just put my two knees on my partner's two hips like so. And now from here, you have a choice of either transitioning fully to a side control, or you can shelf your partner's arm. So I go in, I put two knees on my partner's hips, if I can shelf my partner's arm, now from here I can move to a side control effectively. Once she goes to use that same escape she just tried to do, her arm is trapped and shelved in my leg so she has no underhook from here. So I can use this as an intermediary step to get to side control and trap my partner's arm instead of passing the side control with less control over my partner's upper body and having her spin out right away. You can also, once you dominate both of your partner's hips from here, you can just go in and start slapping the floor and immediately sliding your two knees up to your partner's armpits like so. So once you go to knee elbow escape, you dominate the inside position with your knees, and now from here you can go into attacks from top mount. So we go into this high tripod, look to start passing, knee comes to the floor, and here I free my heel and put two feet back to the inside. Now from this position we go in and we start taking our knee to both of our partner's hips. If I want to mount to my partner, what I can also do, if I'm in side control, let's say I already passed, is I can present my foot to my partner. She goes in, she goes to trap an ankle, and as she does that I free the heel and I put two butterfly hooks back in. So you can backtrack into your partner's legs from here and then you can use this to go to mount from side control. So just another option there. Now once my two knees come to my partner's two hips, I just put my head on the floor and go into a tripod. And now from here you have a choice of either moving to a shin mount where I can start shelving my partner's arm and passing reliably and robustly into side control, or moving across to the mounted position where I can come up and start attacking right from there. So using two butterfly hooks inside my partner's bottom leg, I can pin the leg long enough to either gain control of my partner's inside arm, so she can't explode out or go into any of her recoveries from there, or dominating both my partner's hips with my knees. Instead of dominating the inside hip or dominating the outside hip, I control both my partner's hips and I go into mounted position and attack from there. So now let's look at the interface between going to side control and going to mount. Moving from mount to side control, moving from side control to mount, where I'm about to pass to either side control or to mount and I switch between the two. And over time your partner's shoulders are pinned, they're trying to keep up with the leg-palm-lung battle, and just 10-20 seconds of them trying to bring their knees into their chest and beat you at the lower body gets exhausting and then you can eventually pass. So you see this a lot at high levels where guys will just knee slide aggressively from one to the other, and you don't have to do it fast, you can do it at your own pace, but just understand the dynamic of going into the high tripod, freeing an ankle, and now as your partner goes to push a knee down, for example, and lock you back in half guard, we just go in and we put it on our partner's opposite hip. Now from here, she goes to push my knee down on the opposite side, into half guard, we just put it on the opposite hip. So anytime my partner threatens pushing my knee back to center line and trapping it within her knee line, I just, I focus on taking my knee to the opposite side hip. And I never want, is for her to be able to push my knee with the near hand passing to side control, with the far hand passing to mount, pushing it to the center line and then pushing it back in between her knees. Whenever I feel her push my knee down, I slide it across. Whenever I feel her push my knee down, I slide it across. I play a game where I just go side control, mount, side control, mount, side control, mount. So I go in, I got to start passing to mount, she has to push it down, I go to side control. Now I go in, I start driving, she, for whatever reason, pushes my knee down, we slide to mount, she pushes it down, we slide to side control. She pushes it down, we slide across to mount. Then we play a game here where we go hip to hip until eventually we get a breakthrough, get our pass and solidify our score with a top pin. So whenever my partner goes to push my knee down, she gives one last ditch aggressive push with the hand, she goes to bridge and freak out and push the knee down and get it back trapped into half guard so she can relax and recover from there. Whenever I see that, just focus on getting your knee to the opposite hip. Goes to the opposite hip, goes to the inside hip, then your partner goes to push it down, bring it to the outside hip. You just go outside hip, inside hip, outside hip, inside hip until you can eventually get a breakthrough and get to your pass. All right, this isn't technical in terms of escaping, but you can deal with people who have uber explosive bridges and as you're passing the side control, they can off balance you enough to either completely reverse you or at least recover. So let's take a look at a bridge in both directions. So she's going to be down from here. I go in and look to start passing. First we're going to cover a bridge over the near shoulder, then we're going to cover a bridge over the far shoulder. So we go in and we get the knee down to the floor. We have a cross face in place and from here we go in, we free everything and we feel like for whatever reason, my partner takes her bicep to my ear and gives a strong bridge out in this direction, which a lot of times can off balance me. She can shrimp away now and now from here bring knees to elbows and immediately off balance me. Understand that in order for my partner to give a big bridge, she has to have her head on the floor and she has to look over the shoulder like so. So that would be a strong connection of the head to the floor. The further my partner's head moves away from the ground, the weaker the bridge will be. So I feel like I'm going to have someone who's going to give a strong bridge. The second I pass, I immediately one step the leg up. So now from here, when she goes to bridge, she bridges right into my base of support. The second thing I do is I just take my partner's head off the floor like so. But now as I go to pass and she goes to give a strong, strong bridge, this completely negates your partner's ability to bridge because there's no contact with the head to the floor and with my post leg, she's bridging directly into my base of support. So the second my leg comes free, I feel like someone's turning towards me and she's going to give a strong bridge. I go in, I free my heel, I free my leg like so. And now the second I feel a strong bridge, we're here. The second she goes to move back down, we go in. Now she can give a bunch of different responses. Someone good is going to try to bring knees to elbows. So if I feel my partner's in a concave position and she's trying to bring knees to elbows, we just do what we've always been doing and circle back towards your partner's hips. This is the best response. But you always need that person who feels like they can't bring knees to elbows or they don't know that escape. The second you go to pass, they're going to give a strong bridge. If I just lift in the head, she'll just bridge her head to the floor and off balance me. If I just post the leg, it'll work most of the time, but your partner can still generate a pretty big bridge from here. It's not going to take you over, but you'll create movement. So from here, I immediately post the leg, I lean towards my partner's hips, I lift the head. You can even take your elbow on top of your own thigh. So now when she goes to bridge, there's just no ability to bridge whatsoever. And now as she goes to come down, we follow her. Now she tries to shrink away, we follow the hips. She goes to bridge, we play here. So you'll have to bridge over the near shoulder by lifting the head, stepping up, leg up, and covering your partner like so. So now there's no connection of the head to the floor. Secondly, she has to go in. This time I pass, she tries to start bridging out and over in this direction. Or if I stay aligned with her, she will bridge and take me over like so. To the second I see this, I immediately take my head far out and away. When I see my partner go to post my hip, my hip from here, my head goes far out and away, she goes to bridge, and I immediately move to an angle where I form a T with her body. So we're completely perpendicular, not parallel. The more parallel I am, the easier it is for her to roll me over because we're aligned. I immediately create an angle. So the second I go to pass, she goes to bridge. I post the head on the floor and my two legs extend out like so. And now from here when she goes to roll me through, the post of the head will always suffice and she won't be able to take you up and over. So from here I end up parallel, I pass my partner, I feel a post in the hip. If I feel a post in the hip, I know my partner's going far shoulder. If I feel her far shoulder rising like so, I know she's going towards me. So if she's going towards me, we're here. If she's moving away, we're here. Now when she goes to roll me through, the post of the head will be more than enough. It's very important you don't go too close to your partner. If I go here, my partner has a super explosive bridge, she can roll over your own head. This is no good. So instead, I reach as far as I can with my head. So at no point does my forehead leave the floor. I don't want to be at the top of my head, I want my forehead to be on the ground. So I pass, she goes to start rolling me through, and we're here. And now she runs right into my base of support with that head post, she comes back down, I follow, and now we're ready to go from here. Understand that she can chain these bridges together. She can start usually with a bridge overhead, like so. Now from here she goes to go back down, she goes to bridge across, I have to be ready for that. I have to be ready for you guys to freak out and try explosive bridges side to side, three or four times for the first three seconds. Then once they get scored on, and they understand, okay, now I'm pinned, and they usually calm down and you can go to work. You have to stop that initial bridge when you pass the side control over both the near shoulder and the far shoulder. All right, so this time let's look at going into mount against an explosive bridge. Now when we have a top head and arm, your partner is going to be always inclined to bridge in one direction. Because of the fact that you have a strong cross face in place, your partner is never going to give a strong bridge against a cross face. She's always going to be bridging in the direction that she's looking. So whenever I go into mount, she's always going to be bridging, if I'm on her right side passing, she's always going to be bridging left. Because of the fact that all my momentum is moving in this direction, and her line of sight is in this direction. She can't bridge to her right because the cross face inhibits this, because she's looking left. So from here, I go in, and I know that when I go to mount, I know she's going to be looking to fire off a strong bridge out to the left. So when I see this, we go in, we get to our high tripod, and our knee comes down to the floor. Now, from this position, she'll be holding on for dear life, and now when I go to start extracting my leg, once the leg comes free, that's when you can count on a bridge. So the first thing I do is I elongate my partner's body like so. This will do a couple of things. Number one, it'll stop your partner from posting on your leg and pushing it back down to half guard. Another thing it will do is it will give you a much wider base of support because of the fact that your elbow's high. Right now, if my leg comes out, and my elbow's tented to my partner's body and she bridges, it's going to be a problem for me. So from here, the first thing I do, the second I get to this position, I take my head to center and I lift my elbow above my partner's shoulder line here. So now, as my partner goes to bridge, she bridges right into my base of support. Now as you go to mount, it's going to be a very difficult thing for your partner to off-balance you with this elbow position. Even if I'm hip to hip, she goes to bridge, it's not going to be easy. But assuming you just have some freak on the bottom of you, or maybe they're 100 pounds heavier, whatever the case is, and you feel like even with your elbow above your partner's shoulder line, they're going to off-balance you, just create a separation in your hips and theirs. So the second she goes to start bridging, I just step a leg up like so. Where from here, my left leg comes out, it flares out, it pushes out like so. My left knee connects to my partner's hip, and my right leg steps up with heel to hip connection. So now when she goes to bridge, there's no hip to hip contact. And if there is any ability for her to bridge and get hip to hip contact, it's very weak, and I have this wide base of support with my elbow. That's why it's super, super important where as you go to mount, you take this elbow high and take the head to center to stop your partner, one, from pushing your knee down, two, from giving an explosive bridge to off-balance you. So when I feel like my partner's going to go in and start bridging, the first thing I do before my leg frees is I take the elbow up and I take my head to center. This will put a massive amount of pressure, pinning pressure, on your partner. Now from here, we go in and we free our leg. The second we free our leg, she goes to bridge, the elbow position makes it so she has little to no effect. If she's super, super explosive, go ahead, we just move into this position here. When she has to recover or move around or bridge meet by, it's just not going to happen. And now from here, we can go in and start to work from top mount. Okay, so we can always count on a bridge away from us when we go to mount because of the fact that my partner has that cross face looking in a certain direction. She can't bridge towards the cross face with any amount of power. So you're just going to hold onto the leg in general, just going to hold onto the leg for dear life as long as she can, which isn't the right response, but the most common response. And as you free the leg, I'm trying to prevent the score, prevent getting mounted, prevent you settling into a position where you can attack them. So they give a strong bridge and we have to take the elbow up high, center of the head. And then if we have to misalign the hips to create that hip to hip disconnection, and then we settle into mount and work from there. All right, so now we're going to look at passing from half guard and using the threat of a positional gain to go into submissions. And before we go into this, I'm going to make a connection for those of you who have watched attacking from top pins, side control and north south. There was a transition in those pin attacks where we look to start going in and pinning our partner's near side arm like so, where I go in, I put my head on the floor, I step over and then from here we go in and we slide, which transitions into hantai senkaku and ushiro senkaku. All right, we can do the same thing once we're passing our partner's half guard, instead of moving to side control and then isolating our partner's arm, we can use a threat of a positional gain where they're worried about getting their guard passed and instead move right into a submission. Okay, so whenever I see I'm close to a guard pass, I go into a high tripod, I'm close to a guard pass, from here I put my butterfly hook in and now I look to start dominating my partner's two hips. The second I see my partner no longer has control of one of my ankles, I'm just going to look to take my left leg and slide it above my partner's shoulders and get my knee and elbow connected like so. From here I look to start taking my partner's head and shelving it onto my leg like so. When I do this, what I don't want is to expose my ankle and have my partner trap my leg, it's just giving me an extra step. And we're going to look at doing this from the deep half guard scenario, my partner has a scoop above my leg, but for now we're going to have our leg free. So from this situation here, we have a best case scenario, we go in, we take a knee up and over like so, and now we just take the sole of our foot and we separate on our partner's hip and take our leg down into the pseudo-mounted position. Now from here my partner has a choice, where I start going in and shelving my partner's legs like so, or my partner's head like so. My partner has a choice now, it'll be either keeping her back flat on the floor, which will lead me to Oshiro Senkaku, or many times what they'll do because I have an underhook and a crossface and not a Kimura, is they'll lock their hands and they'll say, oh, his weight's not on top of me anymore, let me explode to top position. So the dilemma is, if they stay with their back on the floor, move to Oshiro Senkaku, rear triangle. If they explode on top of you, switch to Hontai Senkaku, wrong way triangle. So this time, they say, oh, our partner's weight's not on us. So she has to turn on top of me, as she does, I just catch, I use this underhook to catch my partner's shoulder like so, and I follow her into a position like this, where my knee is on the floor, where my knee is on the floor, and my shin points straight up and down from floor to ceiling. Now from here, we just go in and we lock this Hontai Senkaku like so. Now the key with finishing Hontai Senkaku is to have a strong connection of my hips to my partner's neck. So the first thing I want to do, once I lock up, I lock the initial triangle, if I have to, I can come in and hand assist, if your partner has broad shoulders, as I open my knees and I throw my hips forward. That gives me a strong connection of my hips to my partner's neck. Now from here, I pinch my knees together, I start a strong back-heeling motion with my heels, and my hips come forward into my partner's neck as I pull the forearm toward me, and we get strong triangulations with Hontai Senkaku for the win. So from here, we play a dilemma game between Oshiro and Honta. If my partner elects to stay on her back, then we go into Oshiro Senkaku, which we'll look at next. Most of the time, your partner, if they're good, they'll feel your weight moving out of the way, there's no more weight on top of them, they're not pinned anymore, they try to start thrashing side to side and they roll up on top of you. Whenever I see that, no problem, we just go right into a Hontai Senkaku. So from here, we go in, we start our pass. We go to a top-headed arm, we start going in, we insert a butterfly hook, from here, we free our leg, however it may be, and get to our partner's hip like so. Now we slide our leg up, and we immediately, either one step on our partner's hip, doesn't look very stable, but once she goes to move, or bridge, there's no hip-to-hip contact. So we either step on a hip, or we just put our foot here, or leg here on the floor, both are good. Now from here, we slide our knee through, and we just shelf our partner's head by pulling our left elbow to our left hip. Here. Now from this position, we look at what our partner does. If she stays here, we start scooting the corner. Most of the time, once we get to this position, there's nothing pinning my partner now. I have an underhook. If I had a Kimura, which is what we're going to look at later, with Deep Half Guard, if she goes to explosively turn on top of me, the Kimura stops it. But from here, we have an underhook. So now, she can turn on top of me. As she does, we fall into this position, where my hips are slightly elevated off the floor, my partner's shoulders are parallel to the ground, and from here, we have a knee on the floor. From here, we go in, we lock up. If we have to, we can hand assist, pull our leg up, and go in and lock. Now we open up the knees, hips come forward. We close the knees, we back heel, and now as we pull the forearm towards us, we drive the hips forward and start turning belly down, and we get strong finishes with Hantai Senkaku, the wrong way triangle. So we use a threat of a positional game. Your partner's worried about being scored on and passed to the side control or mount. As they're doing that, they're looking to start turning and bridging wherever the case is. We slide right into a situation where we have a triangle dilemma between Hantai Senkaku and Oshiro Senkaku. This time, my partner elects to stay on her back. Now I have the underhook again, I can't control where my partner goes. She either can stay on her back or if she wants to turn on top, she can. She has those options because of the fact that there's no threat of a Kimura. So the onus is on you to be able to finish an Oshiro Senkaku or a Hantai Senkaku. You can't just be good at Oshiro and then have your partner roll on top and every time you go to pass from here, you attack a triangle, you lose position and end the Bamba. So from here, we go in. We start to go into this Oshiro position. We pull everything up. Sorry, I shouldn't be in here. We pull everything up and now from here, my partner stays on her back. So from this position, we start sliding our leg through and we sit on her butt. Now if at any point my partner goes to explode on top of me, we just lock a Hantai Senkaku. But from here, this time we're going to stay long enough to get to a Kimura grip. So rotate a little bit. If my partner elects to stay on her back, this is fine. Once I get to my butt, if my partner doesn't explode on top of me, we just pull this arm towards us with the underhook and we go in and we lock Kimura. So now you have a more robust grip. So now if she tries to explode on top of me, I can stop her with a throw of the Kimura. Now from this position, we're just going to start leaning our body. I don't lean my body and try to extract my foot until I scoot all the way under my partner's head and I have two butt cheeks on the floor. Now from here, I just lean out to one side and I pull my foot out. Again, if my partner tries to aggressively explode on top of me, the Kimura will stop her and even if she does, she ends up in Hantai Senkaku. So it's not really that big of a deal. From this position, we just take a foot to the floor, we connect our two legs, heel to knee. And now from here, we just take our right knee and scoot it to the floor like so. Now from here, we go in, we lock up with Oshiro Senkaku. And now if we have to, we can hand assist, pull everything in tight, and we're ready to start going and making the move. So I move to a position where I shelf my partner's head just as we did before. Now you'll know in the next few seconds what your partner's going to do. If she stays here, I go in, I pull this arm towards me, we go through elbow to elbow, and we lock Kimura like so. So now wherever she goes to move, I can use a thread of Kimura to stop her from moving. Now I start leaning out to the side like so, we just take our leg free and we connect our two legs like so. And now from here, we can stay with a Kimura like so, or we can move to the elbow and start gluing our partner's knuckles to our shoulder. So now once she goes to explode on top of me, the shoulder's controlled. And now this allows us to start scooting an angle to get our knee to the floor where we can go in and start locking up Oshiro Senkaku. Whether we do it with a Kobra grip or whether we do it with the Kimura grip, both are very good. But from here, we go in, we extend the Kimura, we look to start scooting an angle. Right now my knee's not on the floor, I put my knee down on the ground by scooting my hips out and away. Now we go in, we lock up, we have Oshiro locked, and we're ready to go into our five major submissions from Oshiro Senkaku. So whether you go to Oshiro or Huntai from this given position, it's contention upon your partner. If she wants to stay on her back and give you enough time to lock your Kimura, then you have the choice of going to Oshiro or Huntai Senkaku. But if she aggressively explodes on top of you right away, you always have to switch and be ready to go right into Huntai and finish from bottom position. All right, so now we've done this before, but I'm teaching it now, so if you haven't watched the other instructionals, I'm just going to review it here. The five main finishes from Oshiro Senkaku. So we just go in, we're going to start from Oshiro Senkaku, where we go in and we lock up. Now this is a triangle which is harder to finish from than most triangles. It's all mechanics difference. That took me a long time. When I first started locking triangles, I couldn't finish people on the arms, I didn't have a mechanic, I couldn't finish strangles. There's actually a video of me trying to do a toehold from this position in competition one time. It was like a complete disaster. I didn't end up finishing the guy either, I had to actually break his arm. But it's one of the more difficult submissions to master. So as far as strangling from Oshiro Senkaku, what I'm going to look to do is I'm going to go in and take a hand assist here on my foot. I don't want to ever grab my toes because I can pull my toes and I can actually toehold myself. So I go and I either grab over the shoelaces like so, or a lot of times if you have shorter legs, your partner has broader shoulders, I grab on the inside right here. If someone your own size is more common, you grab on the inside here. If you're dealing with someone much smaller than you, you can grab the outside. But most of the time, you grab the inside. Now from this position, I post up on my hand like so, and now I'm going to look to start to pull my heel to my butt and scoot my knee around the corner. I want to start pulling my heel to my butt, I want to raise my hips off the floor like so, and I want to scoot my knee around the corner and pull my heel to the butt and then cinch everything in. Now from here, I take my knees together, I take my heels to my butt, as my hips come forward slightly, I'm going to get strong finishes with a strong triangulation. If you want to make this tighter, you can go forward to your partner's far arm, you can gather up the far arm, and now from here, this will be a very tight strangle indeed. So she will tell you that from the initial lock, I try to strangle, she feels almost nothing. So we go in, we use a hand assist method. We take our hand to the floor, as the hips come forward like so, we pull the knee back, and we pull the heel to our butt like so. And now from this position, knees come together, heels come to the butt, and we get strong finishes with a strangulation or a Shirosan Kaku. So that's one. Number two is from here, my partner has unlocked hands, so we go in, we sit up, and we lock Kimura, like so. Now if your partner has flexible shoulders, whatever the case is, you're going to have to do this very precisely to get tension running through your partner's arm. You see that from here, there's a ton of range, put your leg straight, there's a ton of range of motion my partner has to go through in order to actually get a tap. And if you have someone who's more flexible than her, you can feel like you run out of range of motion before you actually get your partner to tap or break. So the first thing I want to do is put tension running through my partner's arm, and I want to take the slack out of the joints. So I roll my wrist forward like so. I connect my chest to my partner's elbow, and I pull everything toward me. So now when I start to go pull my left elbow behind my body and turn, we get an incredible ability to break our partner with a very short range of motion. Whereas if I'm here, there's no tension, I have to go a very far distance. So I roll the wrist forward like so, chest comes forward, elbow comes back. And now I pull my left elbow behind my body, and that gives us strong finishes. That's two. Now, three, my partner locks her hands defensively. So from here, I feel like for whatever reason I can't, I'm going against the grip, I can't finish the Kimura. Whatever the case is, we go in and we grab elbow deep on our partner's wrist, and we fall down to the side that our knee's on, the opposite side of the locked legs. It doesn't matter how strong your partner is from here. It's the extension of your body versus the grip of your partner's hands. When she goes to keep her hands locked from here, I just go in, I just extend my body in a straight line, and I can always separate my partner's hands from this position. From here, we go in and we grab thumb to thumb on our partner, like we're saying, what's up to someone? And now from here, we catch and we use a V grip. We start going in, we shorten the triangle to increase the leverage in the breaking fulcrum. And now from here, we push and pull across our left hip for the win with Juji Gatame. That's three. Four. From here, I go to finish a Juji. She walks her hips out to the right and she turns her thumb down before I can control it and get into a Juji. So now there's no Juji. When I see this, we go in, we grab the elbow, we push the wrist, and we finish American Lock. I'm going to get strong finishes with American Lock from Oshiro Senkaku. That's four. And five, we have the Cow Hand, the Wrist Lock. Now normally, I don't believe in wrist locks because people do them from stupid positions like standing position where they have no control over any part of their partner's body. Understand that when you're going for joint locks, in order to break a joint, you have to control the joint above the one that you're attacking. So if I'm going for a heel hook, I'm attacking the knee, but I have to control the hip. If I'm going for an arm bar, I'm breaking the elbow, I'm attacking the elbow, but I have to control the shoulder. If I'm going for a wrist lock, I'm attacking the wrist, but I have to control the elbow. And in this case, my partner goes to move her elbow around, the elbow is 100% controlled by the lock of the triangle. So you can actually get extremely strong breaks with wrist locks in this position. And here's how we do it. We go in, we lock my palm to the back of her hand, like so. She goes to straighten the wrist as everyone does. We just go in and we chop the hand by, and we go in and we put a bend in the wrist. We take our hand over our own hand. We take our chin over our own hand. And now our two hands and our chin are in one straight line. So I got to push down as my full body engaged into the break. And finally, and most importantly, we don't use a linear break where I just push the finger straight down to my partner's wrist. Remember twisting locks are always inherently stronger mechanically than linear locks. A Kimura is always going to be stronger than an arm bar. The heel hook is always going to be stronger than an Achilles. So from here, I use a twisting motion where from here I take her fingers and I rotate them in towards her thumb. And that will give you incredibly strong breaks with cow hand, the wrist lock, where we can actually break our partner's wrist. We can break our partner's elbow and we can start to go into strangles. So we go in, number one, we look to go in strangle. Someone small, you can grab the outside. Someone your own size or bigger, you grab the inside. From here, we go in, we heist, we pull the heel into the butt and then we scoot the knee around the corner like so. Now from here, we pinch the knees, we pull the heels to the butt, we get strong finishes. Now if you're doing this, let the triangle go so you don't strangle your partner unconscious as you're doing the rest of the moves. Now from here, we go in, we lock Kimura. We take tension out of the arms and we put tension right into the arm and take the slack out of the joints. Then we take two wrists forward like so to take my partner's hand lower than the elbow. We take our chest forward, we take her elbow towards us. And now from here, we take the left elbow and we rotate it behind our body. She goes to lock her hands. I can't finish the Kimura for whatever reason. We go in and we connect her knuckles to our shoulder, we fall out to the side. She goes to keep her hands locked and there's no way that she could ever keep her hands locked. We go in, we slide up and we switch to control over our partner's thumb. We post on our partner's wrist like so. We shorten the knee to increase the breaking pressure. And now from here, we push and finish with Kyuji Kitame. That's three. She goes to rotate her hips to her right and turn the thumb down before I can control the thumb. So four, we go in, we grab our partner's elbow, we push on our partner's wrist, they get strong American lock, Americana finishes. And finally, five, we go in and we see the hands dangling around me. They broke my partner every other way. I can't finish them. We want to go in and break the wrist. We grab palm to the back of the hand over the thumb like so. She goes to straighten the wrist. We put a bend in the wrist. We go hand over hand, chin over hand. And now we rotate those fingers down towards my partner's thumb and we get strong finishes with the wrist lock, cow hand. So we go in, we play a dilemma game between Hantai Senkaku and Oshiro Senkaku. We move to Oshiro Senkaku. We have five major finishes. The strangle itself, the Kimura, the Juji, the American lock, and the wrist lock. All right, so now, there we go. There we go, day three. So now we're going to be looking at inserting a butterfly hook. When our partner does a good job of stopping me from inserting a butterfly hook when I go into a high tripod. And I'm sure many of you have been there where I go into a high tripod, I try to insert a butterfly hook. They do such a good job of pointing the knee towards the ceiling. That's just a difficult thing to insert a butterfly hook in. You kind of get stalemated in this high tripod where you do all this work to get chest to chest and you go into a high tripod and you think, okay, all I have to do is free my knee. But you can't quite get the knee out because of the fact that you can't insert a butterfly hook and win the battle for lower body inside position. So whenever I see this, I go into this high tripod here and from this position, my partner will point her right knee high at the ceiling. So now I try to pop this butterfly hook and I can walk, but I just, I feel like I just can't do it. Whenever I see this, I take my knee and I physically wedge my partner's hip in place like so. So now I use a shearing method where I push my left knee away from me, the knee of the hip, and I pull my right knee up. So I go knee to knee. Now from here, when she goes to keep her knee up, I just extend with my two knees together, I extend her leg down and away from me. When she goes to stop me from inserting a butterfly hook now, I can easily pop a butterfly hook in and then repeat the previous order of operations to get into your attacks or your passes. So I play a game where I get my two knees together like so, that pushes the leg down and away, and that makes it easy for me to pop a butterfly hook into place. So I use a knee wedge, I control my partner's hips first, then the butterfly hook comes in second. So a general game is I try first, I test the person, see how talented they are. If I can insert my butterfly hook, I can win the battle of the lower body inside position with the foot first. If I can't win with the foot first, I put my knee inside my partner's hip first, then I go to the foot. So I play this game, we go in, I go to a high tripod, she makes it hard for me to insert a butterfly hook. We go in, knee wedges our partner's hip like so, we create this shearing motion where our two knees come together. She goes to stop me now, and now from here we play a game where we free our knee, dominate a hip, and go into a pass. So we use a knee wedge on our partner's hip, and we can't immediately insert the foot, we win the inside battle first at the knee relative to the hip, then the foot relative to the knee. Alright, so now, another alternative to wedging our partner's near hip in place is to just go across and start going in and wedging the far hip. I'm not going to say one is better than the other, it depends on what you want to do, both are good options, we're going to look at how to do this passing series now. So we can go in, and we can start to wedge our partner's near hip in place, this is a great option to start going in and putting our partner's hip in place, we can also play a game where we drive across to the far hip like so. And now from here, I look to open up my elbow once again, I put my forehead down the floor. And now I take my left knee, and I just use my left knee to shear my leg through. So I push with my left leg, I pull with my right, which is just to keep a strong grip, a pretty easy thing to free my ankle. And now from here, you can play a variety of different games. The safest and most conservative is to take your left knee, right now my two knees are connected, take your left knee out, and just go right to three quarter mount and pass from there. So if you want to just quickly put your knees on the floor, recover your base, make sure your partner doesn't take you over and roll you over, put your knees on the ground, this is a great option. You can also stay in this position, I can use it to start freeing my leg completely. Now from here, I can step on my partner's hip. When she goes to bring those legs up, we can go in and we can start mounting our partner. We can use the shearing method to go in, free our leg and start going in and leg riding our partner. Now I have two of her knees crushed together with two butterfly hooks behind her legs. When she goes to move me around, we can go in and start passing the side control or shin mount, her knee on belly on the opposite side. When she goes to start moving me around, I can let her open up the legs and I can fall into a mounted position. We can start passing like that. So there's many different ways that we can go from here. So we come up, instead of going to a near hip wedge, we go to a far hip wedge with our knee. We go into a high tripod as always, knee comes to the near hip, shoot the cross to the far hip. Now she's above my knee, above my knee. We take left knee down, right knee up. Most conservative is I dominate the far hip as we did passing the three quarter mount. If I want to take a little bit of extra time, start moving around, I free my leg completely. Now she goes to recover. There's many different options we have from here, including going into that hundai, hoshiro, dilemma we looked at. We can pass the side control, pass the mount, we can start leg riding. There's tons of different things we can do from there. But wedging the far hip, this time instead of just controlling our partner's near hip, we dominate the entire hip line with our shin. We use a shearing motion to free our knee, to free our ankle, and then we look to pass the more conservative ways of just moving to three quarter mount and then advancing from there. Or staying hip to hip and pummeling our legs in a situation where our head is forward, there's no hip to hip contact. We can keep our partner's shoulders pinned long enough to win a leg pummeling battle and then pass as we want. All right, so now let's talk about using this far hip wedge to pass the underhook side. Now this is just another option. It's not the best option because of the fact that someone can explosively bridge. You're passing to your underhook side, the far side, so they can punch in there on underhook and start to expose your back. So I'm not going to say that it's the best option. It's an option. And usually I prefer to use this when I'm trying to pass into this direction and someone unlocks their legs and tries to bridge and I kind of get forced to this side. When I get forced to this side, I use the far side underhook, which converts to the near side underhook when I'm on that side. I use that underhook to move directly to a shin mount and then control my partner's hips and either move across to the opposite side of my leg pummeling or going into a mounted position. Because of the fact that I have the underhook on the far side initially and then the near side as we go to pass, your partner has no ability to lock a side guard and bring knees to elbow and that allows you to slide your shin up and across the hips pretty easily. So if you didn't understand what I just said, we're going to look at it right now. I know it's a lot of information. So as I'm going to start passing from here and my knee comes across, a lot of times as you go to free your knee, your partner will give a big bridge out to the side like so and start to off balance you. Now the big problem from here is if I stay in this position, she'll use an underhook to start bumping me forward and then from here if my hand slips out she'll get up and now she can either recover or obviously go in and start attacking my back. She can move to a tight waist from there. So the second I see that I get off balanced to this side, for whatever reason, I use, I take advantage of this far side underhook. Right now it's a far side underhook because I'm passing to her right and I have an underhook on her left arm. But when I convert to this side, now it becomes a near side underhook because I have an underhook on her left side and I'm passing through her left side now. So you make a conversion. Your hands don't move but you move from far side to near side underhook because you're moving and you're switching sides on your partner's body. So I use this initial far side underhook to go in and look to free my leg legs up. Now from here, as my partner goes to off balance me or bridge, whatever the case is, understand that your partner has no ability to lock a side guard from here because of the fact that you have a near side underhook. So if she tries to bring her knee to her elbow, she can't do it. The lack of this ability for her to lock a side guard makes it a pretty easy thing for me to put my knee down and control my partner's hips. So now even if my partner goes to bridge and I lose the cross face and underhook, I can control my partner's hips like so. And now as she goes to start getting up towards my back, we just go in and we lift that arm with a tricep grip, okay, with a tricep grip like so. So now she goes to turn towards me, it's a pretty easy thing to puddle to the opposite side. And now from here, we're in the driver's seat. Wherever she goes to move from here, we can go in, flatten our partner out, and get her back to upper body control. We can slide across the mat and she turns back into me and you just play a basic leg puddling game from there. So we're in half guard. If we can't get a butterfly hook because our knees are up too high, we go in, we go far hip like so. As we go to sheer, our leg out and over, she goes to off balance me, knees come to the floor. The second she goes to off balance me, we go into a shin mount like so. Now I unlock my hands. She goes to start moving. I just turn my body and I pull this arm up and now as she goes to get up towards me, it's labored because of the fact that her hips are controlled by the shin mount. When she goes to turn towards me, I just pull my legs to the opposite side. I go in, my legs are swisher. I pull my heels to my butt like so and as my heels come to my butt, I drive my knee towards my partner's far hip. So as she goes to get up, there's weight on the hips. I swish my legs to the opposite side and now wherever she goes, it's a pretty easy thing where you control the position. So once again, we go in, we start to pass. The second our leg comes out from here, she goes to off balance me. Now she goes to start getting up, a very difficult thing from there. I don't keep my hands locked from this position most of the time because if there's no off balance, then it's easy to keep your hands locked. But most of the time, your partner's going to be really bridging and moving and you're going to get off balance from here. So I focus not on the lock and control of the upper body, I focus on the lower body. From here, she goes to off balance me, I'm here. Now she goes to recover, pretty easy thing for me to go back in, start making that upper body contact once again and get to control with the top pin. So we initially pass to the wrong side. We have a foreside underhook, we knee slide across, make a conversion to a nearside underhook. But because of the nearside underhook, you can always bring your shin to your partner's hips and go to a shin mount because the nearside underhook prevents your partner from locking that side guard and knee elbow connection. So we pass across to the far side, usually it's when your partner off balances you to that side when you're trying to pass. You pass across to the underhook side, you use the nearside underhook to move to a shin mount and then you play a leg tumbling game from there as your partner goes to off balance you. So we're going to go into butterfly half guard now. So we're going to stick with the top head and arm for now and we're going to have our opponent look to start pommeling a butterfly hook into place. Now we look at the proper leg position to stop our partner from pommeling a hook in, but inevitably you're going to go with someone who can pommel a butterfly hook in on you. And this is a very general statement, so don't hold me to it, but in general this is the game that I like to play. If my partner can pommel a butterfly hook in before I go into a high tripod, I generally will stay with my hips low and switch to a cross face. Where now from here I can start walking the knees out in this direction and look to start either stepping up and over my partner's leg or knee sliding through and going into a three quarter mount. So this is a very general game. Now the reason for this, the why behind this, is because if my partner inserts a butterfly hook and I go into a high tripod, she can immediately start to off balance me from side to side and look to give me problems from here. Now I'm not going to say that I can't go into a high tripod and go into passes from there, I can do that, but it's going to be a difficult thing to do if my partner has a butterfly hook in and the whole time I'm trying to go into a high tripod she can off balance me. I try to pommel my butterfly hook in, it's hard, and now from here I start to get off balanced. So you can go into a high tripod if your partner puts a butterfly hook in before you actually move to the high tripod. But I'm just going to give a general advice where if they pommel the butterfly hook in from here instead of going into a high tripod and having the risk of her controlling the space between my knees, I keep that heel glued to my partner's butt and from here I just switch to a cross face and I start my passing. And now when she goes to off balance me, it's going to be much more difficult. Now if I go into a high tripod before my partner pommels the butterfly hook in and from here now she's trying to pommel a butterfly hook in and now she gets one, now I'm just going to start my passing from here. I'm not going to take the time to drop back down and then go back in and start passing my partner's guard from here. So in general, if she pommels the butterfly hook in before I go into a high tripod, I'll forsake the underhook and start passing right from here. But if I go into a high tripod and from here, one, she either pommels the butterfly hook in once I get here, I'll usually just keep going, and two, if she pommels the butterfly hook in before or after and I can get my own butterfly hook in, then I'll just keep passing from here. So this is a very general rule. When I have a situation where my partner puts a butterfly hook in before I go into a high tripod, I generally like to control the space between my knees and connect her heel to her butt. So when she goes to off balance me, she has much less of a chance of doing that. And in general, if I'm already in a high tripod and my partner pommels the butterfly hook in, now I just generally try to pommel my foot in or my knee in and start to go into pommels from these positions. So this is just a very general theory on trying to pass my partner with a butterfly half guard. And her goal, of course, is to obviously either off balance me over her right shoulder with the butterfly hook and insert her knee, then she can fight back to inside position as we spoke about before, or to threaten to off balance one way and then off balance in the opposite direction and then control the space between my knees and go into various forms of ashi garami and other attacks from there. So this is just a general theory when I'm passing with a top head and arm and my partner pommels into a butterfly half guard and tries to off balance me. All right, so now we're going to go into preventing our partner from getting a butterfly hook when we go into a high tripod initially. So first, we're going to look at us going into a high tripod and passing with various pommels and then we're going to look at if our partner pommels in a butterfly hook before we can high tripod, then how we can pass from there in a general sense. So the first thing we're going to look at is a situation where I go into a high tripod and my partner tries to insert a butterfly hook as I go into a high tripod. Now as I go into a high tripod, I was talking about keeping my right hip slightly turned so my partner can't insert a knee shield. So the first thing I want to look at is to make sure my partner can't insert a knee shield by coming up into a high tripod like so, and then from here, turning my right hip down. Now what this does is it makes it hard for my partner to insert a knee shield because my right hip is slightly further towards the floor than my left hip is. In addition, what it does is it points my knee towards my partner's inside hip, her right hip in this case. The further my knee points towards my partner's outside hip when I go into a high tripod, the easier it is for my partner to insert a butterfly hook. Okay, so I play a game where I go into a high tripod like so. If my knee points towards my partner's outside hip, she just pommels a butterfly hook in and it's a pretty easy thing from here. So I make sure I go in and as I go into a high tripod, I turn my hip down and I connect my right knee to my partner's inside hip the best I can. High knees here. Now from here, I pinch my two knees together the best I can. When she goes to pommel that knee inside and push me away, it's hard, it slips. When she goes to pommel a butterfly hook in, it's hard. And then from here, we can start going in and start our passing game. So we go into a high tripod, we turn our hip down and we make a specific connection of our right knee to our partner's right hip. Now you're asking yourself maybe, why is it the opposite when we have knees on the floor and hips down, why am I not trying to keep my right knee on my partner's right hip in this case scenario? Number one, it makes knee levers very easy like so. And number two, it makes it easy for your partner to start taking your elbow inside my knee and knee elbow escaping and bringing the knee inside. She wants to bring her knee up as high as she can and bring knee to elbow connection to recover. So I'm looking to drag that knee away from my partner's elbow to make that knee elbow connection and knee elbow escape hard for her to do. So number one, it stops the knee elbow, having my knee on the forehead will stop a knee elbow connection. And number two, I can actually get outside of my partner's far hip with my right knee in this position when my hips are down low. So now when she goes to insert a butterfly hook, it's difficult. I have no ability to get my knee outside my partner's hip because there's no space available when I go into a high tripod. I physically run into my partner's thigh. So if I go into a high tripod and I try to point my knee towards my partner's far hip, I can't actually get it outside the hip because of the fact that my partner has the physical leg is in the way. So now if I point my knee out in this direction, she just pops with a butterfly hook in and easily exposes the space between my knees. So in general, I have my hips down low like so I play a game where I make the knee elbow escape hard and I make it hard for my partner to access the inside of my left knee, the near knee over here. So I walk my partner's legs back towards center line like so, and now I take my right knee for the outside of my partner's left hip the best I can. So now when she goes to knee lever me, it's hard. Once you go to insert a butterfly hook, it's hard. Now I go into a high tripod and move my knee to the opposite hip. I go into a high tripod, I walk in the opposite direction and now from here they bring everything inside like so. So now my right knee is next to my partner's right hip. From here, my partner goes to start putting a butterfly hook. It's difficult. Once she goes to knee elbow escape, she can't because of the fact that now my two knees are pinched together and there's no room for my partner's knee to come in. Once she starts to push on my knee now, knees won't come in and we can start our pommeling game and start to go through our passes from there. Okay? So this is the general rule of keeping butterfly hooks out. We have both low hips and two knees on the floor like we looked at before and now we move into a high tripod and want to prevent our partner from immediately pommeling or butterfly hook into place. So the first thing we're going to do when we go into a high tripod and our partner actually does manage to pommel a butterfly hook in is we're going to test our partner's stickiness of her butterfly hook with an attempted hip switch pass. Now you can always tell when someone has tension running through the leg. Once you get a little bit more experience, someone does it to you a few times, you can always tell when someone has a sticky butterfly hook or they kind of just have the hook in there but it's not really doing anything. There's no tension burning through the legs. So whenever I see there's no tension burning through the legs at any time, whether it's as soon as they put it in or maybe you're there for a minute or two and there's no tension, your partner messes up and relaxes the leg, that's the perfect time to hip switch. And there's two ways that we can do this. We can do this one, without pommeling our own butterfly hook in, two, we can do it with pommeling our own butterfly hook in. So we're going to look at both of these examples now. So from here, let's turn around. From here we go in, we look at our palm, we look like we're going into a high tricot, and from here she pommels the butterfly hook into place, like so. Now I have my head here on the floor, I feel my partner doesn't really have tension running through her legs. Whenever I see this, I can get a quick step out in this direction. I can't leave my foot out here because it gives her time to pull her knee into her chest and recover to a full butterfly guard. So when you do take the step, right now my partner's knee is wedged in place. So I do go to take a step, I have to make sure that I step and go. Right from here, I take my leg up high, like so. My right knee comes up high, I take a small step out and I just hit a quick hip switch. I switch, pass my partner's butterfly hook, like so. Now from here, she'll be trying to bring knees to the inside position, and as she does, I always walk, walk, walk, as we do, I cover my partner's hips and we can pass into side control. So we play a game where we go up, I feel there's no tension, but the butterfly hook is in place. When I see this, I take a quick switch, a quick step with my left foot. Now from here, my knee comes forward and my hip opens, like so. As I do that, I go open, close. Quick step, I open, now my leg sprawls past the butterfly hook and I hip switch past. So this looks like if my partner's going to move me around, I'm pinning the leg in place, my hip switch past, and now from here, we can go in and start passing our partner. Conversely, this time we pommel our own butterfly hook in, as we did in the previous series, pommeling the butterfly hook is in the same, we pommel the butterfly hook in in the same way by either pommeling it in or dominating a hip with our knee position first. This time, we actually get our butterfly hook in place, she gets a butterfly hook in place. Now from here, we use this, instead of taking a step this time, we push our partner's leg down to start creating tension running through her legs. So I put tension with my butterfly hook, I feel no tension with hers, and then from here, we sprawl past and we're ready to work. This time, we both have butterfly hooks off the high tripod. I don't want to pommel a butterfly hook in here because she can off balance me and look to beat me. Whether she has a butterfly hook like so, or whether she has two feet on the floor, I don't pommel in here against a strong bridger or someone who can potentially bridge me over. We go to a high tripod first. She goes to insert her butterfly hook, she gets it, I get mine. Now she goes to start moving me around, I put tension with my butterfly hook. And now from here, as I put tension, again, I open up my knee, I extend my leg, and I sprawl past. She goes to move me around, and now we can go in and pass our partner with a nice quick hip switch with two butterfly hooks in. We cover the hips, and we're ready to go. So hip switching past our partner's butterfly hook, we can feel there's no tension running through your leg with her butterfly hook when you can either hip switch by taking a small quick step to the outside and hip switching, or pommeling your own butterfly hook in first, and then hip switching. Okay, so now bring some leg pommeling into this half guard passing here. We've looked at this leg pommeling before, we've looked at top pommeling and front pommeling before, and now we're going to start using it from this half guard passing position. Understand what half guard basically is, is a way to keep your partner's upper body pinned while you win a leg pommeling battle, all right? Because you dominate all the upper body inside position against your partner, and all you have to do is find ways to dominate the lower body inside position so that you can actually pass your partner's guard. So you're keeping their upper body pinned, and you're playing a leg pommeling game, which if you're both equally skilled, you should be able to win pretty easily because of the fact that you have weight on your partner with the shoulders in head control and the upper body pinned to the floor. So this time, we're going to play a game. Our first, we go into a top pommel, where I pommel my butterfly hook in as I go to high tripod, she pommels her butterfly hook in as I high tripod, and from here we go into this starting position. Now from this position, we're going to go in and I'm going to start pommeling with my shoelaces on top of my partner's shin like so. What this does is it gives me the inside right foot position. So from here, she has the inside right foot position, I take my ankle and I pommel it on top and inside of her ankle. So now I bring my ankle to the inside position relative to her ankle. So I'm incrementally fighting to the inside position. Now once I go into a top pommel, I play a game where I move around with my partner. She goes to extend and move me around. From here, when I feel an extension and her try to off balance me, I just kick my partner's leg on through. And now from here, we have a variety of different options. Worst case scenario, she traps my ankle immediately and we're ready to pass into three quarter mountain from here with a head and arm. That's a pretty easy thing to start a passing game right from here. Another great option we have is the second we go to start taking my partner's knee through. I'm looking to get my partner's knee, of course, below my hip line, the line that draws my two hips together. So I want to go from here to here. We can also play a game where right from here, we just take both of our legs and smack down to mount and then drive our knees up towards our partner's armpits and start to go in and pass. We can also play a game where I make a pass like so. And now as I go to extend, I just pommel to a shin mount, to a knee on belly or to side control across side on the opposite side as my under hook. And finally, we can play a game where I go through, I pass this leg on by, and now from here I use my knee to start collapsing my partner's two legs together and go into leg routing positions. Or now from here, she goes to move those legs around. I can stay in my partner's legs for long amounts of time, tiring her out, fatiguing her, moving at my pace. And then when I'm ready, I can either go in, start passing to mount, start passing to side control and going into all the tack swords from there. So we play this initial top pommel game where from here I go into a high tripod, I pommel my leg to the inside and on top of her leg like so. Now when she goes to move me around, I just extend my leg and get her knee below my hip line. Worst case scenario, she traps my ankle. Now we're passing from three quarter mount. No problem. This is great for us. Best case scenarios is from here, we extend on by and now from here we go in and fall right into a mounted position. We pommel our legs. So now from here, we pommel our legs through. Pommel our legs through to various passing positions. Or we play a game, a longer game, a slower paced game. We go in, we start going in and leg routing our partner. And now we can play a game where she goes to move me around. Takes a lot of her energy and almost none of mine. Then we can start passing very convincingly and with a lot of control from there. So we play a game where we go up, we go to top pommel. Now we're ready to start playing. Now that's a top pommeling game. Now there's always going to be a time when you try to top pommel and your partner will follow you with a sticky butterfly hook. Now understand the relationship between a top pommel and a front pommel. If my partner has her knees to her chest like so, it's hard for her to follow me with a sticky butterfly hook. If she wants to have a sticky butterfly hook and follow me around, she has to start extending her leg towards me to keep a sticky butterfly hook. Now the problem with that is when she goes to keep a sticky butterfly hook, it's hard for me to actually pommel my leg into place. So when I go to pommel and she goes to keep a sticky butterfly hook, she just follows my hips rising and I can't make that pommel. So what am I going to do from here? As my partner goes to follow me with a top pommel, her knee will have to move away from her chest. As her knee moves away from her chest, it makes it possible now for me to pommel in front of my partner's leg. So I start initially with a top pommel where I go in. If she doesn't follow me and her knee stays to the chest and there's no stickiness of the hook, we just go in and get a quick top pommel. My partner has no defensive reactions from here but to follow me and stop me from hitting a top pommel. If I hit a top pommel and I get that foot, that ankle to the inside, it's going to be a real problem for her to recover and go into counters and she's probably going to get passed from there. So whenever someone feels a top pommel is coming, they'll follow you and make it difficult. Whenever I see this, I know that yes, she has a sticky butterfly hook but yes, the knee is going to come away from the chest. And then we front pommel. So we play this basic dilemma game. If your partner wants to have knees to chest, it'll make it almost impossible to front pommel. There won't be enough space but it'll make it super easy to top pommel. If your partner wants to have a sticky butterfly hook, it'll make it almost impossible to top pommel but very easy to front pommel. So we play a basic dilemma game between top pommel and front pommel contingent upon the stickiness and tension of your partner's butterfly hook. If there's a sticky butterfly hook, we go into... If there's not a sticky butterfly hook, we go into a top pommel. If there's a very sticky butterfly hook and the top pommel's not there, we go into a front pommel. So this time, we both have butterfly hooks in place. I go to hit that top pommel. She goes to follow me and extend. Whenever I see this, I just lean forward, my knee comes forward, I pommel inside. And now we move to that same passing position where I dominate both of my partner's hips from here, just like we did before. And I have all of the passing series we looked at before from traditional half guard, where she goes to start moving me around, I can pommel across, mount, side control, wherever you want from there. Okay? So now, this time, I go to start following my partner and move to a top pommel. This time, as I go to do that, she doesn't allow me to hit that top pommel, so I just bring knee to elbow, front pommel. And now from here, when she goes to move me around, the variety of passes become very, very easy from here. So you play a top pommel, front pommel game, and you can play this back and forth. Maybe from here, I go into a... I can try to hit a top pommel, she follows me. Try to hit a front pommel, she brings knees to chest. And now from here, I hit a top pommel. So we can go back and forth. She goes to play that pommeling game. Now we can go in and get quick passes with the dilemma between top and front pommels. If the butterfly hook is not sticky, top pommel is always there. If the butterfly hook is sticky, it's because the knee is coming away from the chest and there's extension running through the leg, putting tension with the butterfly hook, and that makes front pommeling easy. Now we're going to look at a knee slide when we feel like we can't hit a top pommel or front pommel. And this is the third part to this three-part trilemma. So if we feel like we can't go into a top pommel, we go into a front pommel. If we feel like we can't go into a front pommel, we go into a top pommel. We play those two together. But there's always going to be a time where... And this is very exhausting for the person on bottom to understand you can play this for a long time and your partner's pinned, so there's not really much they can do. But let's say you want to get a quick pass, or whatever the case is, or you're feeling unstable, your body position's not very good, and your partner's moving around a lot. Whatever the case is, you want to get to a stable position where your hips are low again and pass your partner's guard. And I feel like the front pommel and the top pommel aren't immediately working. We're going to look to start using a knee slide to start crushing our partner's legs together. And if they avoid having the legs crushed together, it's because they're opening up their knee, and then it's usually easier to hit either the front or the top pommel as you go to hit the knee slide. So from here, we try to hit this front and top pommel from this high tripod where we both have butterfly hooks in. I feel like I can't do either one, whatever the case is. We bring our knee forward, knee to knee like so. And now from here, we just open up our left knee and we point our two knees in the same direction. Here. And now from here, we crush our partner's two legs together and we pommel our left foot behind our partner's leg like so. Now we have two butterfly hooks behind our partner's leg. When she goes to open them from here, it's a pretty difficult thing to do. And now it's the easiest thing in the world to just swish our legs out to the side and start going in and passing the side control. Or it's a pretty easy thing to start opening up our knees and passing across to mount. It's a pretty easy thing to go in to let my partner open up one leg, put a butterfly hook in. She goes to trap my ankle. I put two butterfly hooks in and then they go in and we start passing across the mount. There's a variety of different things we can do from here, all stemming from this trilemma between top pommel, front pommel, and knee slide. So from here, we come in, we feel like we're trying to hit pommels and we just can't do it. Whenever I see this, we just go to knee to knee like so. And now we crush our partner's knees together. And now wherever she goes to move from here, it's a pretty easy thing to make our pass complete. So from a different angle, we come in, we go to high tripod. We feel like we're trying to pommel, we can't do it. We bring our knee forward, knee to knee like so. Then we just slice everything across. We turn our two knees in the same direction and then we pommel a leg out and behind. What you'll find is when you start trying to crush your partner's two knees together and your partner opens up the knee, it usually makes either top pommels or front pommels a lot easier because it gets their leg out of position. If I play a game where I try to go in and top pommel, it fails. I try to front pommel, it fails. From here I try to top pommel, it fails. I go to knee slide, my partner overreacts and opens the knee up. Now we go in, we top pommel and we start our passing game right from there. We play this trilemma between top pommel and front pommel. That's the initial gambit where we try to go top pommel and front pommel and look at a dilemma game between her knee position relative to her chest. The closer the knee to the chest, the easier the top pommel. The further the knee from the chest, the easier the front pommel. Then if both of those fail and you have an advanced leg pommel on our bottom, then you start knee sliding across to threaten leg rides. If you can crush two legs together, you have plenty of leg riding options and a multitude of ways to pass from there. Worst case scenario, your partner aggressively opens up the knee to stop the leg ride and you go right back to your front and top pommeling game. Now picture this. You're in a butterfly half guard. You both have a butterfly hook in place. You go into a high tripod. Your partner pommels a butterfly hook to the inside position and you pommel a butterfly hook to the inside position. Now you're winning the upper body battle for inside position and your partner and you both have one piece of lower body inside position. You're trying to pommel your leg with those previous pommels we just looked at. If you feel like you're just trying to pommel and you just cannot get past that annoying top leg and your partner's not beating you but stalemating you in this pommeling battle, just dominate your partner's far hip. The reason why they can move the leg around is because their far hip is more or less free to move and they can start pommeling the leg. Whenever I see this, it's like I can't win this pommeling battle and I have a butterfly hook in, I just take my knee from this high tripod. I take my knee from the inside hip to the outside hip and I dominate my partner's far hip. Now when she goes to out pommel way, it's the easiest thing in the world to beat my partner with this pommel. Where from here I can either pommel on top and inside and then bring my knee to the inside position. We can start going into mounted positions. I can take my knee to the inside position. I can extract my leg. We can go into shin mounts. We can pass across the side control. We can start going into positions where I front pommel, where I extend my left leg down and away, I front pommel and now from here I have the inside position. We can start going into mounts, mounted positions. We can go to side control. We can go into Oshiro, Hantai, Senkaku from here. There's a variety of different things we can do. Whenever I see I'm losing the pommeling battle or at least getting stalemated in this pommeling battle, just take your knee across to the outside hip and dominate the far hip so your partner can't pommel the leg anymore. So the second I see I'm losing this battle here, I thought I can't pommel, I go here. Now she gets to beat me and follow me around. There's just no way. That's embarrassingly easy to get past your partner's leg. She gets to beat me. You can easily pommel from there. Whenever you feel you're losing or at least the bare minimum getting stalemated and you can't pass, you can't top pommel, you can't front pommel, you can't knee slide, just take your butterfly hook, the knee of the butterfly hook from the inside knee, from the inside hip and start dominating the far hip. If we can dominate the far hip, your partner has no ability to out pommel you. You can easily pommel the leg to the inside and pass with a variety of different leg pommels from there. All right, so now we looked at pommels from a high tripod and we have a top head and arm and a butterfly hook in place and my partner has a butterfly half guard. Like I said, we can always, if my partner inserts a butterfly hook before we go into a high tripod, we can of course go into a high tripod and do the previous moves and start passing. But as a general rule that I have, if my partner puts a butterfly hook in before I go into a high tripod, generally as I'm going to move into a high tripod, if I don't have a butterfly hook, my partner will find some kind of off balance and be able to either recover or clear the cross face, clear the under hook, get a knee back inside and go into recoveries and counterattacks. So in general, I like to stay with low hips, with two knees on the floor and I convert to just a cross face. Now there's some pros and cons to using just a cross face. And many people are so caught up in getting to the under hook when they get into half guard that once they actually lock their hands in a top head and arm, they never ever move away from that top head and arm. They refuse to unlock their hands. You can't be this naive and think that once you've locked your hands, you can just never unlock them. There are certain times where you should keep your hands locked and certain times you should unlock your hands. When I'm working from a butterfly half guard down on the floor like so, the advantage obviously of locked hands is that I have a closed wedge around my partner's head and shoulders. I control an under hook, I control a cross face, my hands are locked and it's very difficult for my partner to clear the cross face and clear the under hook. The disadvantage of this is now that both my hands are occupied actually pinning my partner's shoulders. When I have my hands open and I have just a cross face in place like so. Now the clear disadvantage here is obviously the fact that I don't have my hands locked. There's no closed wedge around my partner's head and shoulders and from here I don't have control of an under hook on my partner. So if at any point my partner does actually begin to clear the cross face, it starts to fall apart pretty quickly from here because the cross face is the only thing I have. I don't have that closed circle around my partner's head and shoulders and I don't have the far side under hook. So provided your partner knows I actually off balance you enough to clear the cross face, you start to kind of run into some issues here where your partner can usually easily recover. The great advantage of using just a cross face and not a cross face and an under hook is that now I have a free hand to work with. Whereas before both my hands are locked and they're occupied controlling my partner's head and shoulders and keeping the upper body pinned. So it's my legs versus her legs. Whereas now when I have a cross face in place, now it's not just my legs versus her legs, now I have a free hand to work with as well. So there's certain times where it's good for us to keep hands locked, certain times where it's good for us to keep our hands unlocked. And when my partner pommels a butterfly hook in, before I go into a high tripod, this is usually one of those times where I relinquish the under hook and I just start playing with the game where now I walk my partner out and away from me. What I don't want is for her to off balance me because of the cross face is in place and I have no wedging over here. Normally as she goes to off balance me over her right shoulder, I can use this wedge on my partner's far shoulder to keep me in place. But now when she goes to off balance me, it's a pretty easy thing for her to start taking her knee inside. So the first thing I do when I take this under hook out is from here I immediately start walking towards my partner's legs and I put my forehead down on the floor. I don't want her pommeling her left hand underneath my jaw and stealing the inside position of the upper body while she also has inside position of the lower body. So the first thing I want to do is make it hard for her to invert and insert her right knee. So I start walking out and away and bring her legs back towards center line. I simultaneously take that left elbow and pull it down towards my partner's shoulder. So now that from here I can lean forward and put my forehead on the ground like so. When she goes to use that hand now to come inside my jaw and start moving me around, she can get it inside here. It doesn't make a difference. The only time I had an issue is when my forehead's off the floor and now from here when she can off balance me right and slip inside the cross face. So I want to walk everything away from me. I want her head to be pointing out in this direction. I want my forehead on the floor. I want to stop her from elevating me over the near shoulder. So I walk the legs away. I walk her line of vision away and I put my head down on the floor and that gives us good base of support. So from here we come in and this is our proper starting position. If she tries to off balance right shoulder, there's just no way she can do it. If she tries to off balance left shoulder, number one, I have a wedge with my left leg behind my partner's buttocks. So when she goes to lift me left shoulder, I'm wedged in behind her. In addition, when she goes to off balance me left shoulder, I have open hands now. I have free base of support. So when she goes to move me around from this position, it's just so difficult and now I have a free hand to start my passing game where I can start going in and plan to start passing my partner's legs and to mount side control and things like that. So there's some obvious advantages of working with just a cross face but there's also some major disadvantages. But in general, if my partner pommels a butterfly hook in, before going to a high tripod, I don't want my partner dominating the space between my knees. So I keep the proper leg position, I keep my hips nice and low, which will make it hard for her to elevate me. I switch to a cross face and I use my free hand to start fighting against my partner's legs. Now this of course isn't to say that you can't move to a high tripod and do the previous series. This is just generally what I prefer against a good leg pommeler. Alright, so there's always going to be a stage between your partner having a locked legs with a triangle and half guard and trying to pommel a butterfly hook in. And normally if you go with a guy who you've been training with for a long time or maybe you are competing against a guy and you watch him tape on him or you just felt him in the match, you can usually tell the difference between someone who's going to try a game based on inside position or a game based on outside position. So whenever I see someone's trying to pommel a butterfly hook in, and you can always tell because they unlock their legs and they start moving you around or bridging and trying to bring heels to butt, I can always pass as my partner's trying to initially pommel a butterfly hook in. So when I have a cross face and under hook, you can always tell, the second your partner goes to unlock their legs, they're going to try to pommel a butterfly hook in. And I know, okay, now they're going to try to pommel a butterfly hook in. I see the leg pommeling in and maybe she misses a few times and this gives me a chance now. So the second I see this, I unlock my hands. I take a deep bite here in my partner's armpit. And then from here, of course, I pull my left elbow back. I take my partner's legs out and away and I walk my forehead down to the floor like so. I have a good purchase on my partner's cross face. Now I play the same game that we were looking at playing before. Because my partner's legs are unlocked from here and she goes to start pommeling a butterfly hook in, I play the knee direction dilemma. If my partner's knees point towards me, I'm going to look to start posting my partner's leg and stepping over into a mounted position. If my partner's legs start pointing away from me, then I'm going to go inside elbow and start passing into mount with the inside elbow or three quarter mount with the inside elbow position. So my partner will be trying to pommel to the inside. Most of the time when she gets here, when I get here, she'll be rocking back and forth. Like so with her legs or her legs will come off the floor and she'll be rocking to try to pommel a butterfly hook into place. So from here, the second I see my partner go to start rocking her legs towards me, we just post. The knees pointing towards me, she tries to pommel that hook in. We just take a big step up and over into mount like so. And from here, we go in, we cover, and we start passing into a nice top pin in the mounted position. So whenever I see my partner's rocking the legs, usually because your partner can't move from here. She's got a very effective bridge. So what she'll do is she'll take the legs off the floor and start the pendulum like so start to create space. Whenever I see this, the legs are going to point towards me. I post. Now I open up my knee. She attempts to pommel a butterfly hook and as she does, we step up and over nice and easily and we end up in a mounted position. So we can either catch my partner as the knee's coming towards us and step over into mount as a post hand or we can wait for her to start pointing the knees away from us. And now from here, as she goes to pendulum, I take knee to elbow like so. Now when she goes to pendulum back in the opposite direction, my knee slips out. And then again, we move to that three quarter mounted position. We start coming in, covering our partner's legs, and then we go into our passing series right off from here. So I play a game where my partner can't bridge effectively in this position. She tries to bridge towards me, towards me. Nope, right. Can't do it. She goes to bridge left. She can't do it. So from here, she starts a pendulum motion. Where we go in, she goes to insert a butterfly hook. We step. She goes to start penduluming him. She goes to pendulum. From here, she goes to insert a butterfly hook. We slide the knee through. Now from here, we cover our partner's legs. We start to go in and pass in a multitude of ways. So before my partner goes to pommel, when she goes to make a transition from a traditional half guard to a butterfly half guard, I forsake the under hook. I switch to a cross face, and I play a game based around my partner's knee position. If the knee faces towards me, I post and step. If the knee faces away, we take the inside elbow and slide the three quarter mount. Okay, so now we're going to be looking at something. You haven't seen me do it in competition, I don't believe, but it's something that I'm hitting on. I've been hitting for a while now, the last year or so against the best guys in the training room, so I know for a fact that it works. And whenever I pressure test moves, there's a few criteria, and obviously you guys see I teach a lot of the things that I do in competition, but there's also things that work that I show that don't work in competition. So the criteria isn't just working on the best guys in the world in competition, it's also working on very good guys in the gym. If it works on more champions in the gym, just because you guys don't see me do it in competition doesn't mean it doesn't work. So this is a move that I've been using to great effect on the very best guys, and I'll show you why it's so effective in the dilemma that's created with this far foot grip. When my partner has this half guard locked, we have our cross face in place, and we have our head down on the floor like so. From here, my partner looks to start to clamp the pommel butterfly hook into place. She has to bring her heel all the way in towards her butt, and this will expose my partner's far foot to me. Where from here, as she goes to pommel, I can reach down and I can physically catch my partner's foot like so. Where from here, I grab right at the end of the lever, and my index finger grabs over the ball of my partner's foot like so. So from here, we have just the, almost grabbing the toes of our partner. We grab just enough to not slip off, but at the longest end of the lever that we can. And now from here, my partner goes to pommel that butterfly hook, my whole thing is to open up my partner's toes so that her foot is in line with her hips almost, into this position here. And now I just pull my partner's heel in towards her own hip. From this position, my partner goes to move around from here, and goes to move that leg around, goes to extend the leg. She can't extend the leg. If I grab in the middle of the foot or at the ankle, my partner can straighten the leg and beat me. But because my partner has no ability to straighten the leg, if she goes to aggressively extend her leg, she actually will hurt herself from here. She can't extend the, she can extend the knee down and away, but she can't move the foot out and away. And now from this position, when she goes to start moving me around and pommeling the butterfly hook in, it's a very difficult thing to do. And this far foot grab will lead you into positions where you can start going into backstepping, leg riding, mounting, all kinds of things. And worst case scenario, my partner goes to strip the grip with this opposite hand, then it gives you an underhook, you can pommel the underhook back in, and then she'll think twice about trying to pommel that butterfly hook in. So there's a lot of things going on here. You can create great dilemmas and great passing sequences off of this far foot grab, but my partner initially tries to pommel the butterfly hook in. Okay, so now once I get to this far foot grab, my partner has no ability to pinch their knees together and control my leg. So I pretty much have an open season on which way I want to pass. One great way that we can start to pass is with a backstep. Where from here, we get to this far foot, this far foot grab, and my partner goes to start moving me around from here, it's a difficult thing to do. So in this position, I just take my knee up into this position, where from here, my knee points towards the ceiling and my foot steps on the floor. If I just try to kick my leg out, she hits a strong back heel, I won't be able to do it. So from here, I take my knee up high so that my foot physically plants on the floor. When she goes to back heel now and trap me, it's a difficult thing. And now from here, we just lean and backstep our leg out like so. It's important that I don't backstep and end up in this position, where now from here, she can plant her foot on the floor, put her hand underneath my jaw, give a big bridge, give the cross face, and then bring knees to elbows. So I make sure, and if at any point your partner gives you so much problem with this near leg that you can't backstep without sacrificing too much space, then we just start passing them out, which is what we're going to do next. But from here, we can always test our partner if we want to pass the side control, hit a quick pass. Take your hand out. From here, we put our forehead on the floor. She goes to start controlling my leg with the back heel. From this position, I can't just kick back. So from here, I have to take my knee up to point towards the ceiling. I have to put my foot flat on the ground. Now she goes to trap me. We backstep through. From this position, if I try to backstep and I feel like it's just not there, I can raise my hips slightly and I can front pommel through. And from here, we can move out and away. So I can play a game or I go to backstep straight out. If I feel like I can't backstep straight out, I go to backstep. She goes to follow. I briefly pop up. And now from here, we can pass the side control. We can move to north-south and we can start working our pinning game from there. So a great initial test to see how advantaged your partner is, is we can go in, get to that far foot grab, and then backstep or front pommel out. Let's actually look at the pommel in a little bit different angle. Just so you guys can see. It's this far foot grab. From here, we go in. One. This time she gives me problems. I go to do it. I feel like I can't do it. I just quickly raise my hips just enough to pommel through. And now from here, we go in and we lock. And all I'm really asking you guys to do is this. It doesn't require you to be flexible or anything. I just raise my hips just enough to just pommel my leg with a front pommel or backstep out and we're free. Okay. So going to a far foot grab, backstep into side control, or moving to north-south. All right. So now we're going to start passing to mount. And with more advanced guys who can start giving strong bridges when you backstep out, this is the one that I prefer. I just wanted to show you the backstepping into side control because it is effective even against high level guys and you can make it work. But this is the one that I favor. I generally prefer passing to mount anyway, so I like this. But let's say you're afraid of going to mount because maybe you don't have control or you're going to get rolled over or you're afraid of someone kipping into leg locks. Whatever the case is, I wanted to show you passing to side control. But this is my favorite way to pass from this far foot grab is passing right into mount from here. So this time we put a cross face in, she tries to pommel, we get to this far foot grab. Now from this position, we just play a game where we start walking, walking, walking towards our partner. And now from here we pull our partner's leg towards us like so. The further I pull her foot up, the further her knee drops down. And now from here you can actually, I'm not going to say that you should be trying to submit people from here because it's not a very high percentage, but if someone has pretty inflexible legs and hips, you can actually submit people from here. So be careful when you're doing this, but most people will find a way to wiggle their way out. I'm just, we're going to clear it with this far hand and not going to submit like high level people from here, but you can submit people. So from here we go in, we start pulling that foot towards us and the knee drops. The second the knee drops, we just go in and we just take a quick step up and over like so. Now from here I just walk my foot one, two, three until my foot connects to my own hand. Now from here we just let go of our partner's foot. The only thing your partner can try to do from here is to use her free hand to start posting on your knee or posting on your ankle. The second I see this, we just pick our partner's elbow and move it up and away. When she goes to recover that leg now and bring her knees back inside or trap me in half guard, we just bring our knee to the floor. And now from here, wherever she goes to move around, we have an underhook and a cross face, we have her flattened out of the mount. So now this time we go in, I guess it's far foot grab. We put her head down on the floor like so. We just start walking towards our partner's far leg. We pull our partner's foot towards us and we put that knee down nice and low. Now from here we take a big step. She goes to trap me, stop me from taking the step. She can't do it. She only has one leg to work with. I just move my leg around, I extend it, I pull towards me, I get the loosing of her legs. And when she goes to stop me from here, we just walk foot to hand. Now she goes to start escaping from here. I release, she goes to post my knee. We put an underhook in place. She goes to recover, knee comes down. And now from here, we can walk the hand up and start our sequence attacking from top pins and going into all of our attacks from there. This is my favorite where I go in and I start stepping over my partner's leg with a far foot grab by first pulling the foot up so that the knee drops down and then going into situations where I can step over him to mount, get an underhook as they go to recover, and then go into attacks after I pass from there.
