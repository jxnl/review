 So we've covered our concepts of leg control, we've covered some tools in the toolbox in terms of upper body grips and grip exchanges. We've also covered when we have flattened someone out, the hierarchy of where our legs want to be, but obviously sometimes someone can find a way to turtle and we don't flatten them out in the process of them turtling. And that's what we'd be looking at, say like if I tie here, where he's actually pretty structurally strong, right? So he's got his elbows in tight, he's on his knees, but the most important point is this is the basic building block position for him to start generating height here. And height's going to be his friend in this situation. If he can start to build height, it increases his chances of escape, he reduces our chances of a position that will immediately lead to a submission. So we need to talk about how we control this position with the fundamental idea being creating pins. So again, we're not approaching turtle from the standpoint of how do I get two hooks? How do I score from here? We're approaching this from an idea that how do we maintain pinning control and most importantly, how do we prevent them from generating height? Because some of the most difficult guys to control are the guys that are very strong offensively from this position where they can generate height and we cannot keep them down. Contrary to what your average jiu-jitsu response would be, which is they would not want to be in turtle, they'd be looking for a way to roll back down because this is a position they're scared of you getting two hooks in. But again, none of our back taking opportunities from here will involve really any of that chair sitting style, falling and pulling them on top of us. We're going to try to stay on top no matter what and even if that means we don't take a back take, it's better for us to stay in pinning control positions as they concede backwards than it is to jeopardize our control by chair sitting. So we'll get started now, we'll start talking about some of the concepts of how we approach this position differently. Let's talk about using a Kosoto hook. So in this situation, we have our opponent, training partner in turtle and we don't have an inside hook. Obviously, we could take a single hook from here, that would be our preferred control position here. It's just a bit of a tighter control on the bottom player. But really we're prioritizing control and control means he cannot stand up or he cannot stand up easily. So when we're talking about prioritizing control and not just diving for two hooks because they score points, we can use a Kosoto hook to control them from these positions. So one of the best ways I find to enter a Kosoto hook is usually on my way to the back out of a situation like a front head. A lot of times a guy will have one of these legs up, maybe on his foot in this position here, right? This is very, very common. So what I'm doing is this basic, I transfer my weight from shoulder to shoulder, to chest to chest and I'm looking to set my heel over Tyler's foot and I'm pulling my knee to me as I start creating this angle into Tyler here. So you can see what it's doing, just following all the principles of control we talked about. Obviously I can't prevent both of Tyler's feet or toes from touching the mat, but I'm easily preventing this one. And I want you to really see how I'm using my weight here. I'm up on my outside leg, my knees on the ground here. My knees on the ground, my knees taking a ton of the weight and Tyler, you can see how easily he can move from these positions. So we want our outside leg up and I'm generating hip to hip pressure here, right? So I'm really pulling my weight into Tyler and I'm on a diagonal here. So you see my weight is draped across Tyler's body here. So we've got the hook, we've got the hip to hip pressure here and I'm trying to actively the knee up hook in, pulling it out here. You see how hard it is for Tyler to start thinking about escaping this position, generating high. And obviously if he really felt worried here and he would start to concede to this hip, we're straight back into leg rides here. So I'm still applying similar pressure if he's collapsed here. And you can see my weight is still on the diagonal and I'm very close to be able to take out wrist rides, our Dagestani handcuffs here. And now it's going to be much harder for Tyler to start to get back up. So it's a cosoto hook to control. His legs are pinned together. He can't put his right foot on the ground. Even his left foot here, he can't really meaningfully put on the ground because the top leg is squashing him here. And you see if he's trying to move here, it's somewhat leading him to worse positions. All he has from these positions is height generated by his hands here. But of course we can start to break him down. And now we've landed in a very dominant position. We've got our wrist ride and our cosoto hooks. And now if Tyler's trying to move here, but I'm generating hip to hip pressure, back healing and trying to face my hips in line with Tyler's hips. If my hips are facing down the shoulder line, it's sort of difficult for me to generate a lot of pressure. So I want to generate hip to hip pressure. I want to face the direction he faces, but I want to emphasize heavy weight on this far shoulder here. So the cosoto hook, great way to knock people over from these positions. So if I was here, we're taking our cosoto hook, we're trapping it to us. I'm trying to take my hips in line with Tyler's hips. I'm draping my weight across Tyler in a diagonal fashion here. And again, very difficult for Tyler to start moving here. So this would be how I use a cosoto control from the total position. Obviously there are things we need to worry about here. Again, we're dealing with people that are good at leg locks. Anytime I start stepping in between Tyler's legs, he has an opportunity to start inverting to the right. But if you really heavily emphasize control, it's going to be tougher for Tyler to create inversion opportunities. He's got too much weight committed to his upper body and his hands. So you can see this is basically the same mechanism of action we'd use in a cradle. And a cradle is what we're going to talk about next. So we'll talk about cradles now. Again, I'm using another entry out of the front head, but we're just talking controls. I'm just giving you examples of how we might easily end up here. And if you're already familiar with the cradle, but you're not familiar with the first control hook we did, we're essentially doing the same thing with our leg hook here. So just to give you an example, so I was in this exact same position again, this leg's up, we've transferred chest and back, we've stepped over. As I start to hook this leg, I connect my hands underneath. So we're connecting our hands just underneath here. And instead of this time, instead of like the previous time, when my hip is generating pressure into Tyler's hip to sort of misalign his spine here, obviously he's much more comfortable when his leg and spine is in alignment. So instead of our hip doing that, this time it's going to be our shoulder. Obviously, a little bit out of grips connected here, but it's my shoulder that's pushing Tyler. I'm trying to keep weight on his left knee here. The closer Tyler's right hip comes to me, the stronger he will be here. And he might even potentially break my grip. So I'm driving my shoulder into Tyler's hip. So now if Tyler starts thinking about trying to stand up, he can start to even collapse his back here. So I'm really contorting his spine and his right leg. Tyler keeps looking for explosive movements. Very, very difficult here. And again, this leg shelf I have here means he cannot place his right leg, his right foot on the ground, reducing his explosive ability. And again, we're going to cover this later, but you can see we have a cradle and Tyler's collapsing his hip and we've got our hands connected here. He basically cannot get back up now. He's so out of alignment. This would be our ultimate form of control. We've got to shelf the leg and slip the legs. So again, when we're using this cradle control, we're trying to misalign the spine with our shoulder here. So we transfer chest to back. I would retract this leg as much as possible going around his leg with my left arm around his going from chin strap around and connecting to the left. I'm driving. Tyler's trying to move. There's a good chance he's going to burn a lot of energy before ending up collapsing to the opposite hip. And again, once he's on this opposite hip, very easy for me to take weight above and across his body. So now Tyler's trying to get up. We've got complete control from this position. So again, a cradle should be a useful tool in the toolbox to prevent guys from both standing up or trying to concede to a more typical neutral jujitsu position. Let's talk about the diagonal ride. So again, if we look at a turtle situation and we try to remove from our mind the concept of scoring points, looking for the second hook and doing everything we can do to get the second hook. And on top of that, even if you're not competition focused, because every instructor teaches from the framework of these standard positions, typically speaking, you're still going to see out of the non-competition gym situations where guys are looking to pull their opponents on top of them to secure hooks. So what do I mean by that? If I have Tyler here with a single hook in, because I'm so eager to get my left hook in, we'll see situations where we're pulling people on top of us basically to try to secure the second hook. So what I want you to remember is that turtle, this is a great position. We are on top of our opponents here and we are making them carry our weight. If I pull Tyler on top of me, now he's not carrying my weight at all. If anything, I can be carrying his weight in that situation, especially like we explained earlier, Tyler can put his feet on the ground. He can sort of dictate to a certain degree where we find ourselves positioned there because his feet touch the floor. Mine do not as a part of that back control. So he could generate pressure to put his weight directly on top of me here. And again, if he can find strong grip fighting sequences from there, he can survive quite a bit and he can even fatigue us. His lateral hip movement with his feet on the ground can fatigue the legs and he's in a strong defensive position to hand fight. So my point is, why do we remove ourselves from a position on top of our opponent where we can make them carry our weight in pursuit of the submission? Why are we removing ourselves from this position? And again, if we go to pull our opponents on top of us in situations like this, what can happen as well is we can fall off of the back. So if I'm on Tyler's back, even single hook, and he's able to generate four point quad pod style pressure, I can shake off the top. And I would even argue that another limitation of the competition setting would be a situation where Tyler's in a quad pod here at four point. And because I want to score points, I start thinking about diving hooks in here. And sometimes I'll get my hooks one, two, three, we score our points. We fall off, we end up on bottom and we've secured the points that could win the match, but we've been shaken off the top. I would argue that there's much better things you could do in that situation than try to pursue hooks to secure points or hooks because that's the framework from which you understand the pursuit of submission, right? So let's have a look at what we could do if we had a single hook. So what I want to argue for is that Tyler's quite strong where these elbows and knees are close together. He can have his hands on the floor there. His hands on the floor, he can generate height. Obviously, if he can't put his hands on the floor and he's stuck on his forearms, he cannot generate upper body height. With his knees here, close to his elbows here, they are in a structurally strong position to now use his feet to generate height here. But I want to show that if we do something called a diagonal right style of pressure where we can lift one arm and one leg. Now, it's going to be very difficult for him to generate height in any structurally sound way. So if we have a single hook in here, I'm looking across my feet so that I can apply hip pressure here. This single hook pressure is tough for Tyler to shake off in the direction I'm applying pressure. Sure, if I was off to the side here and start bumping, we can start falling off. But we're applying diagonal pressure here. Even if Tyler's really low here, we start applying this pressure here. You can already hear it when he's breathing. As I apply pressure into his upper body, it's his head that starts to absorb weight to the ground. So what would he want to do? He'd probably want to generate height with his hands here. And as he goes to do that, we look to lift that diagonal pressure off of the ground here. So look, I've got complete control. Tyler's trying to move. We've got control here without looking for body weight. We've got control here without looking for point-scoring positions. So we're looking at a couple of angles until we break the man. So let's even look at it from this situation. He's on his hands, he's on his knees here, and we've got a single hook and we're on top. We're not looking to jump over here. We're looking to keep our feet crossed and our knees pinched together. This is quite strong. And I can actually apply his hipping in pressure here, but he's pretty structurally sound with his hand on the ground. So to create that true diagonal pressure, I want to attack the weakest part of the elbow, and that'll be the interior. You can see Tyler's already collapsing here. Wherever he wants to go from here, we've got complete control. We can even encourage him to fall onto his left hip by flaring our right knee. And now, face the camera, we've landed in an excellent position here. We've collapsed him, we've twisted up his spine, and by the nature of the way he fell, we've got our wrist right here. We can even come around and use the head control as well. So I'm still applying hip pressure in here. So if Tyler's trying to move, I would argue this control is better than any IBGJF point scoring control position. And you can see Tyler has to use an incredible amount of energy to escape. There are no real technical escapes he can do from here. If Tyler stays exactly where he is, we've split the legs, we've got weight on the hips, we've got a wrist drive, we even have our secondary hand free to what looks like we're just going for a strangle, but we're elevating and applying chest pressure in. So he has no explosive capability from here. And again, I would argue I'd much rather have someone here in any rule set of combat sports than any sort of back take that involves me pulling Tyler on top. Tyler's been hanging out here all day. I can't fatigue him from his position. I can't even make him uncomfortable. So one more time, one more time. This is for me, not for you guys. This is to enjoy crushing Tyler here. But again, we've got our single hook. I'm staying square on the hips here so I can use my secondary leg to square myself back up. So I use my knee to square my hips up. We cross our feet here. I'm back healing and hip again. So compare the difference here. If I just control single hook and a seatbelt and Tyler can four point easy. And now we're carrying a ton of weight. Do not fall off. He can even start shaking us off. Compare the difference. So we cross our feet and start hipping in. So Tyler tries to get up. I won't even use my hands. Really, really hard. That's not even with me using my hands here. I'll be simply stick to the diagonal control as he starts building heart here. And we generate that pressure to control him from this position. So again, I would argue another example when we're approaching turtles that there are much better options than kind of what you've been led to believe based on the point scoring structure of this sport. If we want control, we want control the least of submission. This is going to be a much more high percentage path than the traditional point scoring framework of merely looking for hooks any opportunity we get. All right, so we had our cosoto hook and our cradle style hook to control someone from turtle. Then we had the actual single hook control using the diagonal ride pressure from turtle. But another useful trick is if Tyler faces away from the camera here is we can use crab style hooks to create flaring pressure in Tyler's legs to make it harder for Tyler to sit upright or to get height with his hips. If his feet are together, he can lift his hips quite easily. If we spread his legs, much harder for him to generate height with his hips. So that's when things like these crab hooks start to come in handy. We can use them one at a time with a hook if we didn't want to reinforce our hooks. So we can flare or even we can use two at a time. If Tyler's trying to stand up here, it's difficult. Obviously, I'm not going to keep Tyler here forever, but it's a good little momentary catch to prevent them sitting up. But it also applies by the principles we've spoken about throughout, and that is he needs to get his feet onto the floor to really start generating explosive pressure. And again, the more flared out his leg is, the harder that's going to be to put heel through the floor as opposed to sort of that square linear angle here. So crab hooks, and again, they look quite similar. They come up a lot, right? We were talking about the concept of splitting the legs. These are basically crab hooks here. So if Tyler bellies out, we've still got our crab hook control. And sometimes if you deal with someone super powerful and they start to lift their hips from here, we're straight back in to the same sort of region here. And sometimes guys will be so fatigued, we can hip into them and basically return them to that belly out position there. So again, super useful tool, kind of has to be an instinctual way to capture your balance and provide a little resistance to them standing up. So let's talk about how we could use the claw combined with a spiral ride from this position, just for sort of, again, superior control. If Tyler's here, obviously this traditional jiu-jitsu response of being like, grab a seat belt and try to dive both hooks in or grab a seat belt and try to pull them on top of you here. These have their challenges because again, as soon as I take a seat belt in this position, Tyler's going to come, lift his hips off the ground, start to circle into me and potentially reverse the position. So I'm not a big fan of that. I really, even still, I would always recommend staying behind the arms because we block under hooks here. Second we're over the top, this under hook can always come in. And whether he wants to wrestle or just pull back to a half guard from here. A lot of guys have a lot of trouble with that. They prefer to be on bottom, but the problem with locking hands from these positions is Tyler has great grammy opportunities from here. And if we have locked hands, we can get stuck and our arms trapped together. So I prefer to have open hands here and I prefer to use a claw in combination with a spiral ride. Here, so again, we're sort of, we sort of are still following those principles of contorting the spine because I'm trying to pry this hip towards the sky here as I'm pulling his head in this direction here. It's going to be much tougher for Tyler to grammy from here and it's going to be much tougher for him to take any under hooks because my elbow is blocking the under hooks. So this would be a key grip. So you can see here, I'm going to be locking my elbow. So this would be a key grip sequence. Again, no matter which side you are on, if we lock these up, even if Tyler starts to get up here, I can use this pressure to make it difficult for this elbow to be in a structurally sound position, which would be close to the body. I'm using the floor to try to rotate this out. Now you can already see much structurally weaker and if we flip him around, what I'm doing with the spiral ride is we're turning palm in and it begins to lift his leg off the ground slightly here. And obviously we can lift the leg, he's going to be less structurally sound because like a table, he's got four posts here. If we can eliminate two of them like we did with the diagonal ride, we're going to be in a much better position to control their explosive movements and their athleticism. So we've got the floor and the spiral ride. See Tyler trying to get up? And we can start getting him to a hip, which ultimately where we want to be because we've got the Dagestani handcuffs style here. We can start stepping over the legs. If I step over the legs here, Tyler's having trouble getting up. Doesn't mean it's impossible, but it means he's going to burn a ton of energy getting up. So ideally we do want to bring him to a hip from turtle, but for talking control, we want to bring him to a hip in such a manner that we can be on top of the hip that's pinned to the ground. All right, so we had to remove Tyler. This scene was too dangerous to his Mohawk and that means a lot to the man. So we brought in my older brother, Adam Jones from Australia and he's actually really useful for this position because he's quiet, he makes a lot of noises, so you'll be able to really hear the pressure we're able to apply to someone from these positions. So if Adam's in turtle facing the camera, he comes up to his hands. So we're in this position here, right? And we were talking about the spiral ride and the claw from these angles here. If I'm in this position, I'm having trouble generating movement here. I'll look to reach through to this far tricep here and I won't just touch it. I'm going to reach and try to slap it and bend it. And it might not even be so exaggerated, but as long as we get a little bit of a bend, even if the hand's a little bit on the ground and we can start applying that same pressure into them to start thinking about trying to return them to the mat here. So not all your opponents will give up as easily as this one here, but they will. It will be a superior control to the claw. Quite often the claw is enough, right? Because it allows us to lift this elbow off the ground and it prevents this elbow retracting into the protected space. But if we're having trouble here, I'd reach all the way through. I wouldn't reach over the top and through unless I was swear here. Because anytime we're on the side of our opponent here and we reach across the face, which would be like a seatbelt, they have this hand free for an underhook. And that's when we could start losing these positions, right? So I would only transfer to this on the claw. And really, if we feel like we needed extra resistance, I would remove the spiral rod, the thigh pry style grip, and I would attach that elbow to their chest here. And then if I wanted to run them to the ground, I would run forward to collapse them to the ground. And obviously, everything we've done here today, one set, involving motions like this, we want to be able to collapse them to the ground where they're carrying our weight in this trajectory. We also want to be able to twist up the spine in any way we can, which is obviously a lot of the stuff we've covered. So look at this from one more angle. We've got our claw and our basically spiral rod grip here. Our opponent's on his hands here and we're having a little trouble controlling him. So we reach through and we pull that. So you see now if Adam's trying to correct his balance here, this is a very tough grip to fight from these positions. But if we do feel like we're losing this, reinforce with two and start driving him into the ground here. Wherever he goes, he tries to fight it. Very tough, very easy to start flattening out, thinking about leg riding. And then again, what does he want to do from here? He wants to come up to an elbow. Now we can start cycling back through our positions here. All right, so we've covered all the skills necessary to start changing your opponent's approach to controlling the bottom player. We've taught them all in isolation. We've taught the principles of controlling the legs. We've taught the upper body tools. We've taught the hierarchy of flattening people out. We've taught how to really control and pin people from turtle that are trying to get up or trying to concede. And obviously in ways that involve us firmly remaining on top. So the overarching concepts around this entire product, we're controlling the legs in a way that their feet can't touch the floor, controlling their upper body in such a way that their hands can't post on the floor. We want to remove their ability to generate height. So now we're going to talk about how these things all fit together and how we can sort of change our approach to Jiu Jitsu. And again, you don't need to change everything. You don't need to throw out everything you've learned. Obviously, that'd be crazy. You just need to add this new dimension in and that involves controlling the legs, leg riding any chance we get. So I'm going to sort of go over some base positions, but again, it is going to be, there will be step by step processes in some of these positions, but for the most part, you need to be able to improvise and really adapt your opponent's reactions in such a way that you can land in control positions. So I feel like for the most part, an average Jiu Jitsu guy is either all the way in or all the way out. And when they're all the way in and their opponent starts escaping, quite often they end up all the way back out. And they have this, I guess it would be like a binary type of approach because of the point scoring structure. You know what I mean? They think like to a certain extent, being in close is in the danger zone. You know what I mean? So if they've got a pin position, their opponent starts to escape, they back out. Because they think I've already scored, I'm already up, I'm winning. So they back out and then they re-approach the guard in a safe way. Whereas I want to argue that if we do end up past the guard and they start to escape, remaining on the leg right can quite often, if you wanted to pursue points in a tournament, lead you to re-passing the guard. Which again, is a problem I have with the point scoring system. If I were to pass Tyler's guard and then I allow him to get his guard back and I pass it again, why do I really get rewarded two separate times when it's really my error in the first place for having lost the guard? So just look at it like that. If I've passed Tyler's guard and he never recovers his guard, I get one set of passing points. If I pass his guard, allow him to recover, pass it again, I've received two lots of passing points. So it's like, in my opinion, the first is the best alternative. That's more control, superior control. So let's talk about it right now. Let's look at some of these base positions here. So one of my favorite ones that comes up a ton and it surprises people because they get frustrated that you're not taking the pass, is we're just stapling this inside leg here and I'm hunkered down over the knee shield leg. The knee shield leg is a problem because it can push me back, it gets this knee in, and it can take our weight off of the leg. And again, we're trying to staple the legs as much as possible here. So when we staple here, again, this is a good position for us because Tyler can't hip escape. It requires his inside foot to really generate hip escape pressure, but we're stapling it here. He can't use this inside knee to retain guard. We're covering the knee shield here. We've got control over his legs. We've immobilized the lower half. His only options involve trying to push us, trying to come up, trying to get a pass, trying to come up to a post, things that again, lead us to good positions here. We've got our claws. We can even set up arm triangles. Again, something I'll cover later. I believe arm triangles are set up back here. The strongest arm triangle is back here. It's not up here. We set it up through the pass. So in situations like this, we can now start even changing. Say if he does start to bring this knee shield leg back in, I can think about stepping over and stapling these legs. So we look at it from both directions. I'm controlling him here. That knee shield comes in. I step over the leg. And now Tyler's trying to move his lower half. We've got strong rides here, right? So we're in really good control positions. Tyler starts to push me away, starts to create space here. I'm trying to keep my weight on the legs as possible, whether that means coming back to our half guard staple, stepping over the top, splitting the leg here. But my control is on this plane at all times. Even if we start switching to this reverse side control position here, a lot of guys, especially 10th Planet guys, think, oh, this is a truck entry. But I look at it and I think, oh, a truck entry would involve me taking my weight off of Tyler. Why not step over both to go to the kadhi style, right? And now I've maintained control of his legs here. So now Tyler's trying to move. We've got good control here. If he does start to recover, say he starts to push this knee out, as long as I stay on the legs here, I want to serve this as much as possible. So again, it can come out of a number of positions. Say I found myself inside control here. He starts to bring his inside knee in. Instead of going to knee ride, we just go back to a single leg staple here. Because again, this is superior control over Tyler because it eliminates the use of this leg. If he's trying to put the foot on the ground, it's dead. If I'm inside control here, no matter how good I am here, those feet are free to move. He can start breaking. He can lift the hips off the ground. So we want to be riding these legs. If I'm in a leg drag here, I don't want to score points and pass. I want to maintain control. Control is at the legs. So we can start splitting the legs and stapling over the top. Don't be afraid if they start pushing your legs and squaring back up. Tyler's pushing, pushing, pushing. Stay on the legs at all times. We can reinforce it. Even one's good enough. I find this superior to regular side control. Tyler's trying to move because my weight's oriented against his strongest positions here. So we got our leg right here. From now, like I was saying, he starts in the elbow escape. They're like, if I hang on too long, Tyler puts me back to half guard. And half guard, potentially an offensive half guard. We come back. If I just concede a little bit. Now Tyler tries to put me in half guard. He tries to get up. He gives up. Something better here. Now Tyler tries to move. All our upper body grips come into place as well. So you want to be thinking about this. Even in the context of a wrestling situation. So if I say I hit a double on Tyler. And we're putting down to a hip here. Rather than trying to back lift to get our pain and take down points here. I step over the legs. And shelf his legs here. Tyler's trying to move. Now look, he's giving us a pull grip so we can stop bringing about pain here. Say we fuck up here. Tyler starts to move and escape. We're looking to stay on these legs and he's trying to move here. We're circling back. My control's here. I'm using no energy. He's exhausted. He keeps moving. He keeps trying to escape. Exactly. One of the best alternatives is to turn belly down because it relieves some pressure off the legs. But he's in a worse spot here. Tyler's trying to move. And you can see how our leg riding pressure leads to that belly down opportunity here. So again, just start rolling with these things in mind. You can play your regular game. But rather than being all the way in, all the way out, start thinking about opportunities to shelf the legs, to surf, to ride on the legs, to split the legs, to ensure that feet don't go to the ground and they can't explode up. And then we have, again, of course, our upper body tools. And really, it's up to your opponents which of those they want to give you. But again, we're just going to keep looping. We surf the legs until a strong upper body opportunity presents itself. If we start to lose the legs, improvise, start to move, ensure that at all times legs are pinned, knees are turned away from you, our weight's firmly distributed here. That's going to immobilize them. It's going to make them, they can't use their hands to escape. It's going to make them want to sit up. And that leads us to back taking opportunities. If we do start to control the back and flatten them down, they want to concede back to their guard and we lose our dagger standing handcuff, just make sure that if they go to explode, don't hold on so long. They clear and make a ton of distance. Sometimes taking one step back to a leg ride position is going to be your best bet in these scenarios. But again, first drill, I want you to just try to conceptually piece it into your game and start looking for leg riding situations to control the bottom guy. Obviously start with guys you're already pretty confident in, confident you can beat, then start to work up to more explosive athletic guys. The ultimate example isn't to hit the highest level guy in the room, but it's to hit the most explosive athletic guy. Because that's the guy that we really need to kill the athletic edge they have. And I think you're going to find that leg ride is going to be a much more effective control than your standard point scoring positions. Remain on top, ride the legs, flatten them out. Before we get into the details about how we can find these positions out of ordinary jiu-jitsu positions, I want to just explain the concept of sort of creating a loop around pinning the legs. For me, the most difficult part about this style of control, and again, it's not a passing style, it's not even necessarily a pinning style because we are focused ultimately on the submission. But the hardest part is the initial catch of the legs. Once we catch the legs, we can apply weight to the legs. We want to keep our control there throughout. We want to stay on the legs as long as possible. If I was approaching Tyler's bottom position, however, Tyler's going to try to be putting me in standard positions. Close guard, he's going to be trying to put me in butterfly guard. Even if I were to get past one leg, now we're dealing with knee shield and now we're dealing with half guard. So the hardest part is to create that initial loop. So let's look at it, for example, out of something where I've initially created a smash here. So a smash, we're abiding by the principles of what we've been working on so far, and that is I have been able to collapse the legs. I haven't been able to split the legs, and you can see here I'm not really blocking Tyler's inside knee from being able to come up. If this knee can come up, those toes can go on the ground and look, you can actually start applying pressure to me here. So we've begun this loop here. We've started it. We've created the initial sequence, but we obviously haven't developed the pin out of here. Some of the first things I'd be looking to do is step over the knees here. Now, if Tyler tries to create the same movement, there's weight on the exact part of the body he needs to move to create any sort of athletic movement, recovery movement, anything offensive, anything that could destabilize us. If it's early in our role and Tyler's fresh, because I don't have something too strong established yet, we're getting there though, right? So we have the smash, we've covered the legs. Let's say Tyler aggressively starts turning back into us here. I'm looking to stay on the legs here. So look a couple of different angles there. We had the smash, we climbed up and covered the legs. Tyler, because he's still powerful at this point, he hasn't had to burn a lot of energy. As he starts to recover from here, I don't go and pass straight away because he could hit an explosive movement. What we want to do is immediately find another form of staple. So if Tyler starts to react, my knee is remaining, stapling the bottom leg here. And you can see when we have weight on that leg, even if it's just one, if Tyler tries to use that bottom foot on the ground, we are killing it. We're making it difficult for him here. And then of course, we could reinforce the staple with our other leg. So with one staple, Tyler moves the leg, you can see he's got some movement here. When we reinforce them, harder again for him here. And now what could we do to make this better? We could start covering the top leg as well. Now we've got basically a double staple, right? So if Tyler's trying to move here, you can see we've got superior control. But if at any point he could start to off balance me and push me around, I'm trying my best to remain surfing these legs here, splitting the legs if I have to, applying pressure to the legs in any way that makes it difficult for him to generate recovery. Even when he turns to face me, again, we're riding these legs here, trying to pin him. So what I would recommend, just sort of basic skills, is once you find that initial catch, that's going to be difficult. If you rush out of that catch trying to progress to a traditional position too quickly, you might actually lose the strong control position we already have. So what I'd recommend, you're basically surfing the legs. I'm going to show you how we can move between these positions clearly, how we can enter these positions next.
