 All right, guys, we're here again with BJ Fenix and Sonny for another installment here. We have LegLocks this time. So something I probably should have done a while ago, but I haven't. And we're going to cover all of LegLocks today. So a lot of you guys know our team was made famous through the use of LegLocks. And 10 years ago, even when I started training, 15 years, 20 years ago, LegLocks were very frowned upon. You didn't see a lot of them in competition. And this created a big gap between people's ability to attack and defend at the upper body and the lower body. People were much more adept to both attack submissions and defend submissions at the upper body. But we're kind of clueless with LegLocks and lower body submissions in general as far as offense and defense. So John realized that, exploited that weakness, and he taught us his LegLock system. And we kind of expanded upon that as the years went on, you know, through myself, through Gary, through Eddie, through the other guys. And you know, but the foundation was laid by John. And now we kind of have like our own, you know, our own ideas from certain positions and we add things here and there. So I'm going to go over a lot of that with you guys today. Our LegLock system is based around building an asymmetry in leg positions. Okay. So a lot of people like to work from 50-50. They like to work from other various positions, which is great. But our whole thing is how can I keep my legs safe while I'm attacking my partner's legs? Okay. So instead of being in 50-50, it's an area like this where we both have access to our own legs. So I like to work from positions like outside ashi Garami, where she has limited access to our legs and I have access to hers. Or cross ashi Garami, where she has limited access to my legs and I have access to hers. Okay. So our whole entire LegLocking system is built around creating an asymmetry in the leg positions where I can attack her, but she has very little attacks on me. Okay. So the first thing we're going to look at is how to control the leg. All right. We can't do anything until we can control a leg. And our method of controlling our partner's leg is through our ashi Garami, whether it be cross ashi, whether it be an Irimi ashi, whether it be a 50-50, whatever the case is, we first have to learn how to control a leg. So the ashi Garami is going to be the most important thing. The driving factor of being able to LegLock your partner is going to be how tight and secure your ashi Garami is and how you can follow your partner or follow a strong, defensively sound partner through transitions, control the leg, follow a leg, and then ultimately break a leg. So we're going to control our partner's leg. We're going to follow our partner through defensive reactions, and then we're going to eventually go into breaking mechanics and finishing our partner. Okay. And we're going to work through all the LegLocks from all various positions. We're going to look at outside heel hooks. We're going to look at inside heel hooks. We're going to look at toe holds. We're going to look at knee bars. We're going to look at Achilles locks. We're going to look at all submissions, a full repertoire of attacks from all different various positions, outside ashi, cross ashi, 50-50, Rimi ashi. We're going to go through all the different ashi Garamis, and we're going to look at why we would use certain ashi Garamis in certain positions versus in other situations. So we're going to look at not only the how to do these, to do things, but why would I use one ashi Garami or one gripping sequence versus another? And that's super, super important. Okay. That's just a general breakdown on how we're going to move, and now we're going to go into an overview of how we're actually going to structure things. All right. So now we're just going to look at a little overview of how we're going to structure this. And keep in mind, these are just the basic positions. All these different positions will have slight different variations in light positions, gripping, things like that. But this is the general structure of how we're going to go. So first, we're going to start with a Rimi ashi Garami. And so I'm not going to focus on a lot of knockdowns because in my open guard instructional, we did a seated or Sumpine, we focus on entering into ashi Garamis and then knocking your partner down to their butt using sweeps and various things. So we're not going to cover knocking our partner down. We're just going to focus on once my partner's on their butt, transitioning from ashi Garami to ashi Garami and going for leg locks. If you want to look at how to sit your partner down from these positions, there's Sumpine and seated guard where I cover all of this. But we're going to look first at a Rimi ashi Garami, which just means entering in the initial ashi Garami, where from here we go in, we lock up, we have our initial ashi Garami where we can go in and start to expose outside heel hooks on our partner. Once we go through a Rimi ashi Garami, we're going to make a transition to outside ashi Garami, like so, where our feet are locked on the outside, we're attacking an outside heel hook on our partner. Then we'll move into cross ashi Garami, like so. I've crossed ashi Garami, whether I have control of my partner's secondary leg or not, we can go into cross ashi and then we can start going into attacks on inverted heel hooks from this scenario. Then we're going to make a transition to inside ashi Garami, where I have my feet in the same position, but I make a pass of my partner's foot to the outside of my hip and now we have an inside ashi Garami, where I have a cross ashi Garami leg position, but I have an outside heel hook position. I'm sure most of you know this from my ADCC finals match, where I hit an outside heel hook from inside ashi. Then we're going to go into 50-50, like so. We all know 50-50, where now she can attack an inverted heel hook on me, I can attack an inverted heel hook on her. And then we're going to finally go into Mitsuwa ashi, which is basically the 50-50 of outside heel hooks, where I can have the ability to attack an outside heel hook on her and she can put an outside heel hook in on me. We're going to go through imiri ashi Garami, we'll start with outside heel hooks, go imiri, outside ashi, we'll go cross ashi Garami, inside ashi Garami, 50-50, and Mitsuwa ashi. The whole thing is not just to learn the positions, but learn how to transfer ourselves in a fluid manner from ashi Garami to ashi Garami to control our partner for long amounts of time in order to eventually break through and get to a submission. It's not just about the positions, it's about how to move from an ashi Garami to an ashi Garami and why I would use one ashi Garami versus another in given circumstances. That's going to be our general breakdown, and then we're going to look to tie these all together to move from one to the other in coherent sequences that would actually make sense against a talented and resisting opponent. All right, so just talking a little bit of theory, and I mentioned about this before. First, when we're going to go into leg locking attacks, our whole thing is to fight from asymmetrical leg positions. Now, many people have different approaches to leg locks, and a lot of people favor 50-50 because it's a pretty easy position to enter into, and you have the most powerful heel hook, which is an inverted heel hook to work from. There's no back exposure. There's a lot of positives to 50-50, which we'll talk about later. But when you're in a position that's symmetrical, hence 50-50, you have to know more than your partner. It's not a position where you have an advantage over your partner. Just whoever knows more is going to have the advantage versus when you're in a position like an outside ashi Garami or a cross ashi Garami. You have an inherent advantage because of the asymmetry in your leg positions where you can attack their leg with strong attacks, and they have very limited attacks on your legs. So just as far as theory goes and a little bit of strategy and tactics talk here, whenever I'm attacking my partner's legs, I in general, and we'll talk about strategy later and why I would use one ashi Garami versus another, but I in general am always looking to fight into asymmetrical leg positions where I have very strong attacks on my partner, and she's very weak and limited attacks on my legs. Now this isn't to say that you can't be successful from a 50-50 or positions where you both have access to one another's legs, but in general, you're always looking to hide your legs the best you can while exposing your partner's legs the best that you can. Okay, so our entire leg locking system is based around asymmetry in leg positions where you have the opportunity to attack your partner and they don't have the opportunity to attack you. So just as far as theory goes, our entire system is built around fighting to these positions where we can attack our partner and they have limited attacks on us. All right, so we're talking about heel hooks. It is super, super important that you have proper breaking mechanics for both inside and outside heel hooks. If you look at many people, they're either good at one or the other. They've strong inside mechanics, which inside heel hooks are much easier to get good at because they're mechanically stronger than outside heel hooks. So you either have good inside mechanics or they have good outside mechanics, and they don't have both. It is so, so important that you're able to finish and legitimately break someone's leg, both from inside and outside heel hooking positions. If your partner knows that you can only finish an inside heel hook and you end up in an outside ashi garami, that immediately takes weight off their shoulders. They immediately know that, oh man, he's an outside ashi garami. He can only outside heel hook me. His mechanics don't work. He doesn't have great mechanics from here. So your partner knows now that there's no threat of submission and they can start to go into all their attacks. They can counter leg lock you. They can guard pass. They can do back takes. They can do all kinds of things. So it's super, super important for you as a leg locker that you have strong breaking mechanics from both inside and outside heel hooking positions. I cannot stress this enough. If I get an outside or an arini ashi garami on my partner, the only thing my partner should be worried about from here is, oh shit, if I make one wrong move, my leg's going to break. If she has no, if that is not running through her head and she says, even if I get a strong outside heel hook and I just can't, she knows that I'm not going to be able to break it from here. Her whole thing is going to be not, man, I got to really, I got to work to get out of this position and I have to make sure that I don't mess up. Otherwise my legs didn't get broken. If she's not thinking that, she's thinking, how can I attack this guy? How can I come forward and crush him? How can I take his back? How can I counter attack him? The second we land in any leg locking exchange, whether it's inside or outside heel hook, your opponent should be thinking one thing, fuck, if I don't do something to get out of here, this guy's going to break my leg. The second we land in this position, I should already be exposing my partner's leg. And now, but even without my hand being locked, she's thinking, oh my God, I'm one second away from getting broken from here. Okay. And this is what your, this is what your goal should be. Okay. And this is so, so important, just as just talking about technique, about anything you must be able to create legitimate attacks from any position, whether it's inside or outside heel hooks. If you can't, you're going to limit yourself by a factor of, of a, of about 50%. If you can only finish inside heel hooks, you're limiting your attacks and your partner's legs with heel hooks by 50%. You don't want that. So you want to be able to finish inside and outside heel hooks just as equally and be dangerous from any given leg position, whether you have inside or outside heel hooks. It's super, super important. I feel like I just repeat this in every instructional because it's so, so important and it's applicable to almost everything. Whoever wins the battle for inside position is going to win the leg locking exchanges. If I can keep my feet under my knees, inside my partner's feet and knees, you're going to have the advantage in the leg locks. My partner's seated and she has her legs inside mine. She has two feet and her two knees inside mine. She can go to leg locks. If I have my feet inside my partner's knees, my knees inside my partner's knees, meaning my foot is physically inside my partner's foot. My knee is physically inside my partner's knee. I can go to my partner's legs. If we both have one foot inside like so, or now she has one foot, I have one foot. Now she can go into a leg lock on me. I can go into a leg lock on her. Whoever wins the battle for the inside position is going to dominate the leg lock exchanges. This is a simple rule you can always follow and it makes it easier for you when you're first getting into your leg locks to think, okay, what do I need to leg lock this guy? The first thing I need is the inside position with my feet. If she's standing, if I'm here and I'm playing guard, she can go in, she can spin my legs, she can sit back, she can do all kinds of things where now my feet are exposed. If she goes to walk forward, my feet are in the inside position. When she goes to attack my legs, she can't do it. The first thing she has to do is pommel. Now we both have a foot inside, now she can attack me, but I can also attack her. If my two feet are in the inside and she goes to attack me, I'm the only one who has the attacks. If she's standing once again and she has a right foot forward, my feet are in the inside, she cannot attack me, but I can attack her. The person who dominates the inside foot position will dominate the leg locking exchanges, will dominate the ashi garamis. This is a very simple rule that makes all the difference. If you can keep your feet inside, you're going to have access to your partner's legs, she will not have access to yours. If you both have one leg inside, you can both attack each other. If your partner has two feet inside, she can attack you. My whole thing, for a close guard for example, she stands up, my legs open. Right now, from here, she has the inside position. It looks like her knees are physically outside of my knees, but it's an illusion. She still has the inside position. If she goes to attack me from here and she sits back, she has access to both of my legs because she has the inside position. The second she stands up, if I invert my knee, now I have my left knee on the inside position. I have my left foot inside my partner's hip. Now from here, the only thing left to do is to get my right foot inside. Now when she goes to attack me from here, I have all the inside position. She has no attacks. Only I have the attacks now. The whole battle for when you have leg-locking exchanges is to get your feet and your knees to the inside position relative to your partner's feet and knees. If you can do this, you're always going to be in offense, your feet are going to be safe, and your partner won't be able to attack your legs with counterattacks. You're looking to always get your feet and ankles to the inside position to dominate the ashi garamis and to dominate the leg-locking exchanges. This is a simple, it all comes back to the simple battle for inside position. All right, so let's talk some strategy now with imiri and outside ashi garami. imiri and outside ashi garami kind of go hand in hand. When I have an imiri ashi garami, why would I use one versus the other? We'll talk about this in depth more, but I just want to give you a little overview so you know what we're looking at as far as what I'm thinking and I'm in a match and I'm looking to use one ashi garami versus another. With an imiri ashi garami, you have an inside leg. This gives you the ability to control your partner's second leg and second hip much better than in an outside ashi garami. The problem is because you don't have two feet behind your partner's hips, it's much harder to actually break your partner catastrophically in an outside heel lock. When I have a leg inside, like so, it's much harder for my partner to heel slip because of the fact that I can point my partner's knees away from me and I can control that far leg with my inside right leg. My partner tries to come towards me. I have an expert leg locker, for example, and she's very good at heel slipping. She tries to hide her heel from here. It's a pretty easy thing for me to expose that heel and then go in and start to get good bites on my partner's heel. If I have a good guard passer who is very good at coming up towards me and putting pressure on me, it's very good to start with an imiri ashi garami because now it's much harder for her to come forward and crush me. There's also no back exposure. If I have someone who's very good at countering with back attacks and she tries to slip the knee and take my back, there's no back exposure here because I have an inside foot and leg position. An imiri ashi garami makes it much harder for your partner to come forward and pressure you with passes. It makes it much harder for them to attack your back in any fashion. It makes it much harder for your partner to heel slip and counter leg lock you from here. The disadvantage is that you have feet in front of your partner's hips rather than behind your partner's hips pulling the hips towards you to actually break your partner's leg. An imiri ashi garami, as far as strategy, will make it easy to initially expose your partner's heel like so. Then I traditionally will transfer outside to an outside ashi garami to control my partner's hips so that when I actually go to break, I can pull my partner's butt in towards me with a back heel and I can pinch my knees together much stronger. Now from here, I have a good ability to break my partner's leg with a catastrophic break if I have to. My problem is if I don't have my partner's heel exposed, I don't have control of that second leg now. It's much easier for her to come forward towards me. It's much easier for her to heel slip. It's much easier for her to come in and get her knee to the floor and start pressure passing me. It's much easier for her to stand up and start creating back exposure. As far as strategy goes, in general, I'm not saying you can't start with outside ashi garami and expose your partner's heel, but it's much harder. In general, when I'm working with an imiri ashi garami versus an outside ashi garami, I use the imiri ashi garami first to protect myself from counter locks, from back kicks, and from guard passes. I use it to expose my partner's heel and then when it's time to break my partner's leg, I transition to an outside ashi garami and then go into strong breaks from an outside ashi garami. Just as far as strategy goes, in general, against good, good guys, I start with some kind of an imiri ashi garami. When she goes to come forward and heel slip or crush me, try to hide the heel, I can always easily expose my partner's heel. One way or another, I make a transition to an outside ashi garami where now from here I can pull my partner's heels, my partner's hips towards me. I can pull my partner's hips towards me. I can get strong breaking positions where now from the outside heel hook position, I don't have to worry about a heel slip because the grip's set. I don't have to worry about a pressure pass because she comes forward now, she breaks her own legs. I don't have to worry about a back take. There's no back takes from here. The heel hook's set. Once I actually have the grip, now we go in. We lock up the hands and now we're ready to go in and break our partner with a strong outside ashi garami. As far as general strategy goes, I use an initial irimi ashi garami to expose my partner's heel and to protect myself from back takes, from heel slips, from guard passes, from all the stuff that we associate with leg locks. Then once I actually have the grip, I'll transfer to an outside ashi garami to get much stronger breaking mechanics. Now we're going to go into the relationship between cross ashi and inside ashi. Now let's look at the relationship between cross ashi and inside ashi. First cross ashi, like so, and then inside ashi when our foot's on the other side. With cross ashi, I have the ability to control both of my partner's legs with double trouble. This is a very good holding position and I can, to some degree, attack both my partner's legs. The primary leg here with heel hooks and the secondary leg with achilles locks, reverse figure four achilles locks. We can do leg laces, we can do all kinds of things from here. Very good attacking position, but a good person knows that at some point I have to release his secondary leg to get off a strong attack on the primary leg. This will lead them into rolls where they roll, roll, roll, and they either create back exposure like what famously happened to me twice against Felipe where he hit the misdirectional and he took my back, or I'll just roll until they're out of bounds and you feel like you just can never get a grip on this leg. So in general, I'll use a cross ashi garami if I feel the guy is good, but not good enough to avoid me exposing his heel in any kind of way. There's many different ways we can expose the heel and we can use this position very effectively. If I deal with a person who I know is going to give me an issue exposing the heel and they start, as I go to expose the heel, I start turning in this direction, I'll make a transition where I pass the leg across and I go to inside ashi, like so. This is why it's so important to have good outside and inside breaking mechanics because now from here, when she goes to roll in this direction, she exposes her own heel. I can go in, I can lock up my grip, I can start rolling through and we can finish on the other side with a strong outside heel hook. In addition, like in my finals match with ADCC, if she tries to start transferring back in this direction and slipping the heel, because of my leg configuration and orientation, it's very, very difficult for her to slip the heel because now my feet are on the inside of my partner's legs, triangled. When she goes to point her knee in this direction, I have two knees pointing in the opposite direction and that makes it the easiest thing in the world to expose my partner's heel. In general, just as far as strategy goes, I'll control my partner's legs in this position and if I can get my partner to the correct hip, in this case her left hip, I'm attacking her left leg, I want her on her left hip. If I can keep her on the left hip and I can either go in and expose my partner's heel or I can pass the leg across and expose my partner's heel, I'll attack my partner right from cross ashi. If my partner starts transferring herself to the wrong hip, the correct hip for her escape, then from here I'll make transfers from cross ashi to inside ashi where now from here we can go in, we can expose our partner's heel, we can bring everything up and we can start putting everything in tight and going in for finishes. If my partner realizes that if she keeps rolling, she exposes her own heel and she elects to move back in the direction she came from, it's too late now because now when she goes to slip the heel, I can always point my two knees across, we can go in and expose our partner's heel from here. As a general strategy, and this goes much deeper, this is just general talk and we'll move into this obviously as we move to the instructional. I'll control both my partner's legs from cross ashi. If I can keep her on the same hip as the leg that I'm attacking, left versus left like so, whether it be just with simple double treble, whether I pass the arm across, whether I have this tombstone or double dracula grip that John calls it. By the way, John changes the names for all these positions all the time and doesn't tell anybody and then looks at us like idiots when he calls something out and we don't know what he's talking about. He's like, yeah, I've been calling something different for six months. I'm just like, well, yeah, he never told us. So if there's any difference in nomenclatures from this instructional versus John's in like 2018 or 17, it's because we maybe changed some of the names in different positions and we're not all up to date on them yet, but it's going to be pretty similar. So I'm sorry about that in advance. But from here, whether I can keep my partner on the correct hip, I can go in and expose the heel and I can get good solid heel exposure. I'll use cross Ashi. But the second I feel I'm a day late and a dollar short, it's too late. She's already moving in this direction. I'm going to lose the heel from here. Whenever I see this, I'll transfer to inside Ashi and now from here we'll go and expose the heel and either roll through and follow or if she moves back, I can always expose the heel a second time. Then we can go in, we can lock up, we can break our partner. Okay. This is a general strategy. Cross Ashi versus inside Ashi will depend on what hip your partner's on and whether or not you can expose the heel from one position or the other. All right, so we're going to go into 50 50 strategy. First of all, I'm sorry, I apologize in advance if I'm like scratching like my head or like my face or my nose or my beard or like my arms through this. We're in Boston and it's freezing cold. I'm not used to it. I just came from Vegas and it was also freezing cold there. So my Vegas is so dry. My skin is so overly dry. I'm just itchy everywhere. So if I look like a crackhead during this instructional, it's just cause I'm so itchy. Like my nose is itchy. My scalp is itchy. Everything's just itchy on me. So if I'm like itchy myself between like talking, um, just cause my skin's really dry because I'm not used to the cold anymore. I like got soft living in Texas and it's like the coldest it gets is like 50 degrees usually. Um, so sorry about that in advance. Um, but so what 50 50 is interesting because, uh, it's a symmetrical position. So if you're dealing with a strong leg locker in general, I don't use that position because you are in danger. 50 50 I like to use against mostly like big spazzy guys. Um, it works really well in wrestlers and people who don't have a lot of knowledge on leg locks because there's no real danger of you being counterlocked by someone who like is a strong wrestler. For example, 50 50 is very hard to spaz out of because what everyone tries to do when they're at 50 50 the legs are locked. They try to do is they unlock their legs. They try to push their knees and move away, push on my knees and move away. And then from here they just expose their end of exposing their own heel as they straighten and unlock the legs and then you can go and you can, you can submit them pretty easily. So what happens is you have 50 50 you're playing around, maybe you separate their legs, they extend their leg and try to push away, but the leg gets caught. And now from here as they're extending, you just go in, lock up a heel hook and you can finish them. Okay. In addition to that, and they try to come forward and crush you. Even if she gets her knee all the way to the ground, she can't put any pressure on you. Okay. Once you get the pass, even if she gets a head and arm from here, she can't pass. She's locked into the leg, the leg configuration stopped it. She's a wedge going across her hips. They want you guys to pass and put pressure on me from here. The figure four will always allow me to make space, fight back to the inside and I start off balancing her in one way or the other and sit her back down. So there's no pressure passing from here. There's no back taking from here. If your partner's knee is trapped. And in addition to that, uh, it's very hard for her to clear the legs. Um, provided there's not grease involved, uh, without exposing her own legs. If, uh, if your legs are still connected, if she just tries to aggressively explode straight out and away from here, she always gets caught. And now because the feet are unlocked, the heels exposed, we can go in and start trapping our partner. So general strategy against a good blood locker. I won't end up in a shootout here, but against a big spazzy explosive guy, like wrestlers are perfect example. Um, who don't know much about leg locks and are just trying to come forward and pressure pass you, uh, pressure pass you or explosively move out of leg locking positions. 50 50 is a great option. Okay. So I'm going to go against for 50 50, but against a talented, uh, leg locker, the Jiu Jitsu player, I generally don't like to be in a shootout shootout where I have access to her legs, but she also has access to mine. So just general strategy. 50 50 is great for spastic low level as far as knowledge, um, opponents because they will counter leg lock you. That's very hard for them to pressure you or to, uh, to just explode out of the position and clear the leg position altogether. So mutual Ashi, I won't really use much because you're in a shootout. Um, usually when you're mutual Ashi and you both have outside, he looks, it's just because one of your leg positions was off or your pummeling legs and you just ended up there. It's not because you put yourself there purposely. Um, but the general strategy when I played mutual Ashi is to go second. Okay. And this is the reason why normally we're in a position like this. We have mutual Ashi. She's looking to go down to her shoulder to expose my heel. Okay. But once she goes down to her shoulders, try to expose my heel, she exposes her own heel. Okay. So the person who goes first is usually the person who loses. So if you end up in this position, my general strategy is we end up here, right? We're both going for attacks. I wait for my partner to go. Okay. Because now as my partner goes to move down to her shoulder, she tried to expose my heel. I can hide my heel to some degree and she exposes her own heel to some degree. And then we can go in, like you start putting heat on her and she has to roll through. Then we can make a transition moves outside Ashi and then eventually break my partner. So this strategy, because we're in a shootout, like 50 50, I generally don't play this position. Um, if I do end up in this position, I'll usually use it against people who are, uh, who are pretty inexperienced compared to myself in leg locks because everyone gets overzealous. They see a foot in front of them. They're like, Oh man, I'm going to submit this guy. They go down to their shoulder to expose the heel and then boom, they get counter leg locked and now they're getting broken on the back end because they, they went too soon and exposed their own heel and didn't hide their feet while they're attacking you. So just general strategy playing there. I don't usually play in that position on purpose. We usually kind of just end up there because the, the pumbling was, someone was lazy with the pumbling. Um, but if I am there, I usually always go second because that's my, my partner usually will fall to a shoulder in general, expose her heel as she's trying to expose mine and then I can start my offense moving to outside Ashi and then getting to a break. Okay, so let's look at our general directions of our opponent's escape. When I have any kind of leg locking position, whether it's I read the Ashi like so, whether it's cross Ashi like so it doesn't make a difference. So you can, your partner can move in these directions from whatever Ashi ground. They can just straight up back away from you. They can post on your knees like so, and they can just scoot straight back and pull the knee free. This is true from outside Ashi. She can dump post, just scoot back and away. She can do it from a Rimi Ashi garami or from here she can go in and she can start just scooting back and away. She can strip my, usually she'll strip my heel, my foot off the hip like so, and then she can just back straight up and away or she can go over the leg first and then back away. So your partner can back straight up and thumb post or post your hamstring with her foot and then just back straight up and clear the knee from within my knee line. Okay, so this is my knee line. This is a knee. I need to keep her knee trapped within my knee line in order to actually attack her legs. The second her knee goes beyond my knee line, now she's out. The second her knee, cross Ashi, moves within my knee line, outside of my knee line, now she's gone. Okay, so she has to clear her knee from outside my knee line. If she can do that, then she's out. She can do this by backing up and backing away. Okay, another way that she can stifle me here is she can come forward towards me. Now this again, doesn't apply with 50-50 in some Ashi garamis. So 50-50 does still apply, she can't pass me or take my back, but she can stifle me and stop me from attacking her right then and there. But I can always set her back down and go into attacks. But she can come forward, get her knee in the floor for example, make some kind of upper body connection, and now she can go if the pass is her back takes her over the cases. She can do this from cross Ashi. She can do this from outside Ashi. Or she can come forward, she can get her knee to the floor, and then I can start running into trouble from here. Okay, she can even do it from a Rimi Ashi garami like we talked about before. If my foot isn't properly placed and my partner's far leg, and I'm here, she can come forward, she can get her knee to the floor, and from here she can start to give me problems. Now I can counter this by rolling through and doing all kinds of things, but she can come forward and she can at least give me issues. Even if we're in 50-50. Here I can heel hook her, she can come forward, put her knee in the floor. She can't give me any problems with passing or back takes from here, but she can put some amount of pressure on me and I can't heel hook her right away. I can always rock back and forth and I can always sit her down or invert and then go back into attacks, but she always has the option to come forward and generate some kind of pressure. So she can move backwards in a way, she can move forwards and towards me. Another thing she can do is she can turn. Whether I try to go in and I grab a grip of my partner's heel, and she goes to heel slip by turning right, like so. Or whether I get a strong grip on and she goes to rotate out and start a rolling sequence, or she turns in the opposite direction. Same thing from cross-ashi. She can heel slip and turn right, or she can try to roll out and turn left. Same thing from 50-50. All these different positions. You can always turn. You can turn to heel slip, or you can turn and start trying to go into a roll. Your partner can move backwards, your partner can come forwards into you, your partner can turn left or right depending on a given situation, and then finally your partner can look to re-pommel legs and start to go into attacks on you. So I have cross-ashi for example. My partner can pommel her legs and stay in the pocket, and now she has attacks where she can go in and start attacking my feet. We're in 50-50. We can go and she can separate my legs, and now she can either go for heel hooks, or she can pommel and start passing my leg across and go in for outside-ashi attacks. She can start passing her legs across and transitioning to her own cross-ashi, and now she can go into attacks. Okay, so there's four major directions your partner can look to move in, and we have to have reactions for all four of those. We have to stop our partner from moving straight back and away and clearing her knee from within my knee line. We have to stop our partner from coming forward and pressuring us. We have to stop our partner from turning in either direction or following a turn. We have to stop our partner from re-pommeling and getting into a situation where she can attack my legs, but I can't attack hers anymore. The idea of double trouble is controlling two of your partner's legs whenever you can, and this is especially true when you're trying to sit someone down from an ashi garami, and when they're standing over you. I went through that in the swim pine, I believe, or seated instructional, or both of them. It's especially true when you're going for knee bars. When you have a knee bar controlled, your partner can easily high-leg and rotate internally inside of the ashi garami, so to control both of your partner's legs is very important. Same for cross-ashi. There's a multitude of situations that you can find yourself in where controlling both of your partner's legs is very, very important. I was at a Dean Lister seminar one time, and he made a joke, and he said, having two legs is like having two chicks. Two is always better than one. I was like, okay, I'm never going to forget that. Whenever possible, whenever I have the ability to control two of my partner's legs rather than one, it's always going to be better. If I'm in cross-ashi, and I have the ability to initially control two of my partner's legs, it's always better. If I'm in a situation where I'm in an orimi ashi garami, like so, and I can control my partner's second leg with my leg versus just one of my partner's legs, it's always going to be better. If I'm in a tapo shiro position, where I go in, I got to spin my partner's leg. Whenever I can control my partner's second leg, it's always going to be better than one. Two is always better than one. Whenever I can, if my partner's standing over me, for example, and again, not going too far into this, but if I have an orimi ashi garami, and I bop my partner forward, and I get to the second leg, whenever I can control the second leg, it's always better than controlling just one of my partner's legs. Because now that she goes to get up, I control two legs, and I can sit my partner down nice and easy. If I'm in a 50-50, she's standing over me, whenever I can get to my partner's second leg and control that second leg, it makes it easy for me to start inverting, sitting my partner down, going into backside 50-50, controlling my partner's legs, and going into attacks on my partner. I can invert into backside 50-50. Let's rotate so they can see this leg. No, no, just this leg. Rotate. There we go. Whenever I can control two of my partner's legs versus one, it's always going to be better. You'll see this idea of double trouble coming up as we go through, but controlling two legs is always better than one. Whenever we have the opportunity, double trouble is always what we're looking for. Control two of your partner's legs when we can, and eventually switching off if we have to, to one leg control to dig for my partner's heel. Just as far as a control element, when you have both of your partner's legs, it's going to be very hard for them to do anything offensively to you. We need to get this idea in our head that we need to be able to follow a resisting, sometimes spastic and explosive opponent through transitions and follow their leg as they're rolling through. For example, if I get an outside heel hook and my partner goes to explosively roll through, I have to be able to follow my partner's leg through, finish on the other side with control, and then go right into a break. I have to be able to follow my partner through transitions and carry on into my attack. If I have a cross ashi, for example, and I'm going for a heel hook, and I'm digging for a heel, and she goes to roll, I have to be able to follow the leg through and emerge on the other side with situations where I can go in and either catch a heel as I roll through or follow my partner through. There's going to be some times where you roll two, three, four, five, six times. You have to follow that leg through the roll, through the transition, whether it be with an Achilles grip or some kind of other grip where you can follow your partner's leg, stay attached through the ashi garami, and then get to a situation where you can expose the heel or whatever you're trying to do, and then get to a finish. This is what I was talking about, how the ashi garami is the foundation of you being able to control your partner. First, we need to work on good ashi garami mechanics, good controlling positions, good wedging with the ashi garami so we can follow a leg because you're always going to have defensive reactions where people try to roll and explode away from you. That's the most common reaction with people who are afraid of leg locks and people who don't do leg locks, which is a lot of people. So being able to follow a leg through transitions against a talented, resisting, explosive, spazzy, sometimes greased opponent is super important. On the flip side of that coin, being able to follow a leg, you have to be able to switch legs. So when you see you're attacking one of your partner's legs and they pull a leg out, you have to be able to quickly switch from one leg to the other and then go into attacking your partner's opposite leg. For example, I have a cross ashi garami, like so. I'm attacking my partner's primary leg, which is her left leg. If I go in for an attack on my partner's left leg, I'm trying to set up a situation where I can attack it, and for whatever reason, her knee slips past my knee line, and she pulls her leg out, that's the perfect time to transition to an outside ashi garami or a re-mi ashi garami on the far leg and switch and go into attacks on my partner's legs. Same thing from here. If I have an a re-mi ashi garami, for example, and I see that for whatever reason, my partner's coming forward and she's giving me problems where she peels a foot off the hip, she goes forward, she goes to come in and crush me, from here I find myself in a situation like so. I can go and I can go from attacking my partner's right leg to an inversion, where now I'm attacking my partner's left leg as a primary leg. If she slips that leg out and away, I'm back to attacking my partner's right leg. I can control, follow, and then ultimately switch legs if I lose the ashi garami, where she pulls one leg out, leaves the other leg behind, and now I'm attacking my partner's opposite leg. You have to be able to control legs, you have to be able to follow legs as your partner's spinning out defensively, and if you lose a leg, you have to be able to switch legs and go into attacks on your partner's other leg, or if both of the legs are out and away, switch to upper body grips and then go into other attacks and have the strengths of other systems take over the weaknesses of the leg lock system, where if you lose the legs completely, you make a transition to a sumigeshi, or you go to a triangle, or you do whatever other attacks you're going to attempt on the upper body. All right, so there's a couple of basic ashi garami drills that we can do. Some of them are positional, some of them are working on actual bite, getting bites in the heel, getting lock and shortening Achilles grips. We're just going to run through some of the drills that John used to have us do when we first started leg locks. The first is a standing ashi switch. This is from a rimi ashi garami, where my partner stands with square feet and we're between the legs like so. From here, I'm just going to throw my legs up, so my whole thing is to create this concave position with my shoulders, where my body mimics the shape of a rocking chair or a banana like so, so that I can rock back and forth very easily and not use any energy. If your shoulders are flat and your head's in the ground, it's extremely difficult to bring your legs up without using a ton of energy. I want to create this effect where... Step off real quick. Where I'm here and I switch sides every time I rock forwards and backwards. She's on top of me. We just grab our partner's legs like so. We throw up an initial ashi garami. When I throw up the initial ashi garami, I'm looking to thrust my hips forward and create as much connection between myself and my partner's leg as possible. When I fire my legs up, my partner should be off balance. You should see as little daylight as possible through here when I actually make a connection. This... You see all this space here? This is no good. I just throw my legs up here. This is nothing. When I throw my legs up into position, this is what you should see. Now there's no daylight coming through like so and your partner has to take a step. My heel and my knee connect like so and I monitor my partner's far leg. I throw my legs up. Every time you lock into an ashi garami, your partner should be initially off balance a little bit. When you feel him starting to step, you just release the lock. We should go back and forth from leg to leg. We usually do about 10 reps each and then we set our partner down. We go through 1, 2, 3 and then at 10, we set our partner down to the floor and we just get used to throwing the ashi garami up into place, creating that strong connection and then switching legs. Realistically, when I throw myself into position, my partner strips the heel off and switch legs and then we can go into our off balances. We also have the cross ashi drill. We're from here. We grab our partner's leg like so. Maybe my partner hits a toriando for example. Go here. Maybe he hits a toriando for example and tries to move into either side control or north south. I go and I take my partner's two legs and I just fire my leg up like so. I use this to pull myself in. My hips come forward towards my partner and I want to slide myself into my partner's knee. That's no good. My hips come forward as they rise towards my partner's hips and legs and I just chop my knee down behind my partner's knee and I leave my legs open here. If I figure for my legs, it seems tighter. It's not. She pushes the legs down and I lose the position. When I throw my legs up, I scissor my legs instead. I keep my feet open. She has to push my legs down now. Push her. Legs don't move anywhere. Now from here, we're going to start sitting our partner back down. We come back here. Take our foot out. Now we fire the opposite leg across like so. We pull our hips up with the back heel. We thrust our hips forward and then we chop down behind our partner's knee like so. Now we take our shoelaces to our partner's hip. We push ourself forward. We reset. We come up, forward, we chop down behind our partner's knee. She has to explode out from here. It's just not going to happen. She has to push my knee down. It's just not going to happen. We take our shoelaces in front of our partner's hip. We push ourself back and then we take ourself up to the opposite side. We just go back and forth and then we start catching. The second our partner in front goes to toriando, she shoots herself through. Immediately we throw ourselves up. Now we're in cross ashi. Now we can look to go in. Start sitting our partner down. We can look to go in and start inverting. Bring your partner's hands to the floor. Making transitions to heel hooks. Switching to double 50. Going into attacks here. We practice this cross ashi drill. Again, the whole thing is my hips rise. I create that strong connection to my partner's hips with my, or my partner's legs with my hips. Sorry, come back up. And I create an angle. I create an angle. Okay? So we can do standing drills, both with straight ashi garami and inverted drills with imiri ashi garami. We can also do seated leg pommeling drills. Where from here, I have a leg inside. We start in, we have both hands on each other's legs like so. And now from here, we just play a game where I look to pommel inside and she looks to pommel. Similar to the standing drill that you see people do all the time, where we both go to pommel underhooks in. You see stuff like this. And then if I can eventually get to two underhooks, I win. Same thing here. We're trying to, we still both start with one leg inside, one leg on the outside. Now when we say go, go ahead. It's all about pommeling legs inside. She tries to pommel in, I'm always just pommeling legs, the inside. Until one of us can go in, control two legs in the inside position, now we can slide in, go into an imiri ashi garami, and let's just start going in and attacking our partner from here. We can just play a seated leg drill over here. We have hands on the floor, we have hands on our partner's ankles, doesn't make a difference. The second you say go, we go in. She goes to pommel, I make it hard. I use my leg to stop her. You can see, when she goes to pommel, I follow the leg, I bow my knee out. So I have a push on one side, from the back, a pull on the other. When she goes to pommel, it's hard. Now I stop her, she goes to stop me from pommeling, I play a game with my leg, where I push her knee in first. I move the leg around, so when she goes to stop me from pommeling, it's hard. Now my legs are inside, when she goes to pommel inside, I'm sticky, it's difficult for her to pommel. She pommels the leg inside, now when she goes to beat me, go ahead. Now we're ready to go. So we play a drill, we both start with the leg inside, and we play that pommeling game until one of us gets two legs to the inside, and I can move into an irimi ashigarami. And you can always do things where you switch legs, like we talked about before, where I have control over one of my partner's legs for any given position, and from here, whatever reason, I feel the leg slips out. As the leg slips out, we can go in, we can switch into a tatsuna partner's opposite leg. I can always switch legs as my partner pulls and extracts legs. Maybe I lose her from 50-50, she pulls the knee out, we go in, and then we go into an outside ashi. We make a transition, we go to a cross ashi. We can just transition to and from various ashigaramis, and just get used to going through the drill here, where whenever we lose a leg, we gain the opposite leg. She pulls the leg out, and we get used to switching constantly, going from leg to leg. She goes to roll through, and we can transition to a cross ashi. We transition to an inside ashi. She goes to roll through from here, I sit up, she goes to pull the leg out, and we can transition. We pass over to 50-50, pull everything through. From here, she goes to start standing up on me. I feel like 50-50 is not going to be an option. We go, we put our hands on the floor. From here, we switch in. We pull our partner in, and we switch to cross ashi on the other side. She pull her legs out, we go in, we feed across, and we get a cross ashi on the other side. We go to backside or double 50. We just transition from leg to leg as our partner pulls legs out, then repommels, we transition into positions where we can attack our partner's legs, she can attack ours, and we should get used to moving, controlling legs, following legs, and switching legs. These drills, five, 10 minutes a day, when you're first starting out, even when you're more advanced, make a big, big difference. All right, so there's two different forms of Achilles grips. One is for control, one's for finishing. If we're looking to control an Achilles grip, we just grab anywhere below the knee. We have controlling Achilles grip. When we're looking to actually finish our partner, from here, we're going to look to make an adjustment where we practice on biting, getting a strong bite at the long end of the lever on the Achilles grip. Whether you're in a seated position, whether you're in an ashi-grami, doesn't make a difference. From here, we're going to go in, we have an initial control on the Achilles. We're going to take our opposite hand, and we're going to switch through just to control our partner's leg. She has to pull the knee out and extract it. Even if the ashi-grami is weak, but she has to pull her leg out from here, she won't be able to. If I'm just starting off, my partner's very experienced, has good timing, is very, very slippery, and I go to make a transition where I loosen the control of the Achilles, and I go to move it, and the ashi-grami is loose, she can pull her leg free. What I'm doing, I punch this hand in place, this gives me extra control so I can loosen the Achilles grip so that she doesn't have to pull her leg out and away. It's just not going to happen from here. Now from here, I roll my shoulders forward into a concave position, and I look to get my wrist as close to my partner's heel as possible. My shoulders come in concave and move into this position. As my shoulders come concave, there's two goals we're trying to accomplish. Getting my wrist as close to my partner's heel as possible, the long end of the lever, and getting my chin as close to the front of my partner's ankle as possible. This means my hands will be high. Now from here, once we're in position, we close the elbow. The closer the elbow is to my ribs, the more pressure your partner feels. And I have a variety of grips that we can use. Whether we go in like so, with our traditional grip here, whether we go figure four like so, whether we grab our own hand, it doesn't make a difference. The main thing is getting to this position. That even without locking my hands, your partner feels an incredible amount of pressure with the high hand position, the long end of the lever, and that elbow coming in towards the rib cage. Okay? So just practicing going from a controlling Achilles to a finishing Achilles. We come in here, we catch. Now the whole thing is, the second I move into this position, it's all about elbow to ribs. And that puts pressure on. Now before I'm even locking hands, she's already on breaking point. And you can do this from a seated position. You can do this from Ashi Garami, it doesn't make a difference. Initial control, I catch. You loosen just enough so you can slide, but have the confidence your partner's foot will get caught like a knot at the end of a rope. You always hear John reference. That's the idea here. So from here, she has to pull the foot out, gets caught. And now we're in perfect position to go in and start going in for strong Achilles locks. Okay? So concave shoulders, our wrist moves down to the ankle, at the longest end of the lever possible and chin moves as close as possible to your hands in the front of your partner's ankle. Now we're ready to go. Okay? So you can practice this moving from a control Achilles to an actual breaking Achilles grip where you can go in, control your partner initially, and then quickly switch where you pummel a hand in, make a strong switch, and then go into Achilles ready to go. We call this a cowboy drill because it looks like a draw. If you're a cowboy. Okay? Where we're in an Ashi Garami, you want to expose our partner's heel. The best way to do this, you can both practice it, is doing it from a mutual Ashi where we both have a grip on our partner's heel like so. Or just in like so, we have a grip. We have a grip on our partner's knee and we want to expose our partner's heel. The key here is that when I reach, I don't want my forearm aligned with my partner's shin bone. If I do this, you always have heel slippage. I want my forearm aligned with my partner's foot. So that when I catch, I want this. Not this. If I just try to catch the heel and I just bring my elbow straight back, you catch, but when your partner goes to slip, she slips. So I go back and I cut a corner so that my forearm and my partner's foot align. So now when she goes to heel slip, which is not going to happen. And now from here we can lock up. We just start in and we just practice. One. I'll go first. Just one, two, three. You can do as many as you want. You lock. When she goes to heel slip, it's just not going to happen. Now she does it on me. She catches. She catches. You just go back and forth practicing catching your partner's heel. You can do this from various different situations. You can do it from outside heel hooking positions. You can do it from inside heel hooking positions. Over here, same concept applies. I don't have my forearm and my partner's shinbone aligned. My catch here is sloppy. She heel slips, she's gone. I go back and I come around the corner so that my forearm aligns with my partner's foot. She goes to heel slip, not going to happen. It's much, much harder from here. She goes on me. She catches. She catches. She catches. Do the same thing from cross-arching. If I'm sitting up, you can get a little bit more advanced. We have different grips. And now from here I have to do a sit up first, a forward shift. And then I catch. She goes to heel slip, not going to happen. Now from here, we're ready to break. We're getting in this habit of catching your partner's heel properly. Then when you're in ashi dorami, you have the control, it's time to break. Boom. We draw. We draw. We draw. And it's right there. The second you lock the hands, you're ready to instantly go into a break and get the fetish. All right. So now just some very basic, very general concepts on Achilles locks. So as we spoke about, there are two different kinds of Achilles locks. There are control, basic Achilles locks where I'm just looking to control my partner's legs and climb up the leg and pull my partner back in towards me. And then there's a second kind of Achilles where I'm actually looking to go in and finish my partner. So just as far as we spoke about moving from a control Achilles, biting up the leg to an actual attacking Achilles. Okay. So just understand that there are conceptually two different kinds of Achilles. There's control and there's actual finishing Achilles, which we already looked at. When we look at most Achilles locks, we look to go in and start finishing. From here, when I go in for Achilles locks like so, and I put my feet onto my partner's hips and I'm looking to go in and finish. As I go to finish, I'm actually looking to move my hips away from my partner like so. So that from here I can move back and away and I can drag my partner's foot out towards me out and along the mat. Okay. When I'm going for heel hooks, my hips are coming in towards my partner. When I go for Achilles locks, if my hips come forward towards my partner, you see how my hands and my chin start to come away from one another. This is not what I want. You get a good pressure, but the real finish with the Achilles, the strongest finish we're looking at from here is if I have feet onto my partner's hips like so, even if my hands are low and from here, my hips move away from my partner. That puts additional pressure where from here I bridge my hips forward and in, but they sag back and away from my partner's hips. With heel hooks, it's the exact opposite. I'm coming forward and bridging into my partner's leg. With Achilles locks, if my hips come forwards and you extend your body, you'll always push your hands and your chin further away from one another. If from here my hips move away from my partner, this is where I get strong breaking mechanics because it puts additional tension on my partner's foot and it pulls the foot further away from the leg. Essentially what I'm trying to do is this. As my hips move away, it takes the slack out of my partner's joint and then the actual mechanics finish the Achilles lock. Whenever I have various forms of Achilles locks from here, let's say my partner gets a step over my leg, we switch in, we move to Achilles locks like so, my whole thing is I lock up, my hips move away. My hips come in, you get good pressure, which will tell you it's much tighter as the hips move away. Just conceptually, with most Achilles locks, hips are moving away from my partner rather than in towards my partner. There's exceptions to this, obviously, if you go belly down, I'm opening my knees and bridging into my partner's legs, but in general, when we're facing belly up, many times from here my hips are moving away from my partner. There are exceptions, but in general, when you finish standard Achilles locks like everyone sees, it's the hips moving away and the chin coming down, which gives you strong breaking mechanics. There's an obvious dilemma game, conceptually, between Achilles locks and heel hooks. When I go for an Achilles lock, I'm looking to start taking my partner's toes down and away from her shin in this fashion here. One of the easiest ways she can defend this is by booting her foot and pulling her toes back towards her own shin, which will make an Achilles lock much harder. The more she boots the leg, the more heel exposure there is. The more she points the toes to defend the heel exposure, the better Achilles lock I have. Now from here, we can go in and we can finish our partner. There's a basic dilemma game here. If my partner boots the foot, Achilles lock will be hard, heel exposure will be easy. If she points the toes, heel exposure will be hard, Achilles lock will be easy. Just conceptually, the dilemma game between heel exposure, heel hooks, and Achilles locks, depending on where my partner's toes are pointed. Just some concepts, some basic ideas as far as Achilles locks go. Now we'll move on to knee bars. We're going into knee bars. Understand that if you don't have double tremble, it's pretty easy for your partner to roll out. If I had a standard knee bar, like so, and I fall into this position, if your partner comes forward and tries to open up the knees, which a lot of times they can, they can change the angle, but if they can't open the knees, all I have to do from here is just high leg over and rotate. From here, they change the angle and they internally rotate inside the osteodermy and now the knee bar's gone. There's a couple of ways to deal with this. The main thing is whenever I can, I have double trouble. Whenever I go in for a knee bar, I want to be in a situation where I control both of my partner's legs, like so. Now my partner goes to high leg through or roll out, she can't. Now from here we can go in and we can start extending our partner's leg with knee bars in various fashions. Whenever I can, I like to have double trouble and control both my partner's legs as I'm going for the knee bar. If I can't control both my partner's legs and double trouble's out of the question, I move into lat knee bars whenever I can. Double trouble is my first choice. If I can control both legs when I'm attacking a knee bar, I will. If I can't have double trouble and I can get to a situation where I can go into a lat knee bar, like so, number one, mechanically it's much stronger. You have much better breaking mechanics from this position, where now from here you can easily shred someone's leg right in half. In addition, it's much tighter and much more friction throughout the leg, much more tension as well. When your partner goes to high leg over and rotate out, you can follow the leg much better and still end up in situations where you can break your partner. Because there's a lot more connection of your partner's leg to your body, like so. Here it's just my hand holding my partner's leg. When she goes to rotate, she can change the angle pretty easy from here. I have a full lat knee bar, like so. Now I physically place my hand on my partner's calf. I take my knee, my elbow tight like so. There's much more friction between her leg and my body, and there's a lot more tension running through her leg. When she goes to move the leg, first of all she doesn't even want to because she feels like it's going to break. When she goes to high leg over, she goes to rotate. It's the easiest thing in the world for me to follow, and I can finish with a lat knee bar. Now a lat knee bar is a lot harder to get to because you have to transition and actually make the transition. As you're doing that, she's probably spinning. If you can't control both legs and you can switch to a lat knee bar, do it because it's much mechanically stronger for breaking, and you have a lot better tension and control as your partner goes to spin out. Finally, if you feel like lat knee bar's not working, double treble's not working, heel knee bars are great options too. Where you go for an outside heel hook or even an inside heel hook, your partner goes to roll, she gets about halfway through, and from this position we go into a heel knee bar where we have the breaking mechanics of a knee bar, but we have a heel hook grip because this mimics double treble position. It's not as good, but it mimics double treble position because your partner... Normally if I just have a knee bar like so, if she falls down to this hip, I can follow her and I can still break her. What she will do is she'll turn back in the opposite direction and she'll just change the angle, and now she's out. For the heel knee bar from here, if my partner goes to fall to her left hip, I can just stay in the heel knee bar and I can break her, or I can switch to karate if I have to. If my partner goes to turn back in the opposite direction, she turns back into a heel hook and she breaks her own leg. It limits your partner's ability to spin in the direction she needs to in order to escape. Number one is double treble is best. If I can't get double treble, I use a lat knee bar, or if the opportunity presents itself, I use a heel knee bar because now I know which direction my partner has to go and she can't toss and turn from side to side. She has to go to one side, and as she goes, I can either follow her through or I can make a transition to either a lat knee bar on this side or a full cross ashi as she goes around, and now I can start going in for heel hooks. Using double treble is best. Using lat knee bars is good. Using heel knee bars is good. What I want to try to avoid on good people, I'm not saying it can't work, what I want to try to avoid on good people is just holding your partner's heel and your partner's Achilles and trying to just go for a knee bar with only one leg controlled. It's pretty easy for them to escape. It can work, but against good guys, it's difficult. Those are some just basic general concepts surrounding knee bars. Now talking about toe holds, toe holds and heel hooks are very similar. All right, the first and most obvious, this goes a little bit into strategy as well, is toe hold pressure will always come on faster than heel hook pressure, because when I have a toe hold, my hands are doing the work. The hands are a lot faster to move than the full body is. If you're in a shootout, for example, we're in a mutuashi and she goes to put on a heel hook and I go to put on a toe hold, she's going to have a stronger break mechanically, but many times she won't be able to actually enact those mechanics because she's going to be getting broken sooner from the toe hold, and then she'll have to go into a defensive role and then I'll switch my position into whatever I want as far as attacks go. If you're in a shootout and you have a choice between toe hold and heel hook, understand toe hold pressure is always going to get... toe holds will always get pressure, breaking pressure on your partner before heel hooks will, but they ultimately won't be mechanically as strong as heel hooks because of the fact that your hands are applying the lock rather than having your partner's leg connected to your full body, where now your body is doing the breaking. The toe hold pressure comes on first, but it's not mechanically as strong as a heel hook. Just going into mechanics and a little bit of strategy there, there's a famous... not a famous match, but a match between Yuri Samoez and John Blank in a combat jiu-jitsu match where John Blank goes for a heel hook, he has a heel hook on Yuri, but Yuri uses the toe hold to actually get him to roll and ends up submitting him with it. You can see various examples of this pretty much everywhere, across the board in all different rule sets. Toe holds come on faster, but they're not mechanically as strong as heel hooks. When I'm breaking with a toe hold, I'm looking for a shearing force, a coupled force, two forces in two directions. It's like John always references, if I asked you to rip a piece of paper with one hand, you wouldn't be able to do it. You need one force in one direction and an opposing force in the opposite direction to actually tear the paper. Same is true with toe holds. If I just push my partner's toes to her butt, you see this in competition all the time, people lock up toe holds, they're cranking on the toe hold, the toes go into the butt, and they see nothing. It's because they're only going in one direction. If I just push my partner's toes down, she feels nothing. If I just pull the heel up, she feels very little. But when I take the toes down and I pull the heel up, you get incredibly strong breaking pressure right from the beginning. That coupled force of the toes come down, the heel comes up, that's what gives you breaking force and the ability to actually break your partner's leg. You need that coupled force, that shearing motion of the toes coming down as the heel is coming up like so. Those are your main points with toe holds. As far as the strategy goes, toe holds will always give you pressure first, but won't be mechanically as strong to break your partner's legs as heel hooks. If you're in a shootout and your partner's going for a heel hook and you go for a toe hold, many times you'll be able to get a defensive reaction from them first with a toe hold, and then you can go for the move that you actually wanted. Maybe you stay with a toe hold, maybe you move to a heel hook, or whatever the case is, depending on the scenario. In addition, you need those opposing forces of toes coming down towards your partner's butt and heel being pulled up towards your partner's chin. That rotational force with two opposing directions to actually get a good break on your partner's legs. The heel hook concept is pretty much the same as toe holds. Obviously, the same coupled force applies. You need toes going down, heel coming up. The heel hook obviously will be better for mechanical breaks, but won't come on as fast. The pressure won't come on as fast as toe holds. The only thing to add to heel hooks is that you will always have an inherently stronger break with inverted heel hooks or inside heel hooks than you will with outside heel hooks. It's just the nature of the mechanics. We pretty much went over everything in the toe hold section, but just the only thing to add is that if you have a choice between an outside heel hook and an inside heel hook, choose the inside heel hook. That's going to be mechanically stronger, number one. Number two, you can do a lot wrong on an inside heel hook and still get a very good break, whereas if you have an outside heel hook, you've got to do a lot of things right to get a catastrophic break on your partner's leg. Given the choice, always choose inside versus outside, but be able to break someone's leg from both inside and outside heel hooking positions.
