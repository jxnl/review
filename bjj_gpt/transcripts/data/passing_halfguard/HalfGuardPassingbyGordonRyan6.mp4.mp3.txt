 So now we can play a game where we get to this far foot grab and we play a leg riding game to kind of move at our own pace instead of just back stepping right away or taking a big step over into mount. We can start leg riding knee to knee with my opponent from inside the half guard. So again, there's so many different leg riding positions you can use. I'm going to probably eventually do a full systematized leg riding instructional when I get leg riding. Right now I just have leg riding positions. I don't really have a system for it yet because I suck at Jiu Jitsu obviously. So I'm not going to talk too much about it now, but eventually I'm going to put all my thoughts into one systematized leg riding instructional. But for right now, we can go in and we can start taking this far foot grab like so. Now from here, I play a game where I start pulling my partner's foot up and I start pushing my partner's leg down with my right elbow like so. So from here, we just go in and we just catch, lock up into half guard. I just go in and I just catch over my partner's knee like so. And now I start putting weight down over my partner's knee. This will force my partner to do is start to turn her lower body towards me. And now from here, we play a game where I start controlling my partner's leg. Now depending on how flexible your partner is, sometimes you'll be able to put your partner's knee all the way on the floor like so. Many people, you won't be able to do that. So what will happen a lot of times is as you got to bring that knee down to the floor, your partner will just aggressively kick the knee forwards. And from here, they'll either one, allow you to slide into three quarter mounts like so, or two, as the knee comes forward, you'll slide into this position here, where now you can pinch your partner's knee to the bus by pinching your two knees together. Now when she has to move around, you can't use that butterfly hook to extend me anywhere. And from here, it's a pretty easy thing at your pace now to work to an under hook and then to just slide that knee straight up. She's in a very uncomfortable position from here. So if she wants to do anything to free her leg and start to off balance me. So as I go to slide my leg up, she gets her leg free. I get my leg free. Now we're both in a comfortable position, but I'm in top mount with an arm above her head. So from here, we go in, we get to this far leg, this far foot grab like so, we start pulling her partner's far leg towards us and we step over our partner's knee like so. As we go back, we pull the foot towards us. And from here, if my partner is resisting by bringing the knee outwards, we push it down with our elbow and we step into this position. So many times, one of two things will happen. One, from here, it shall extend the foot. As that happens, you just bring knee to elbow. And now when she has to bring the knee back up to trap you, she can. We slide the three quarter mount, we start to pass. Or we go in, we step over, we start to knee ride like so, or I start to leg ride like so. And now I just step over my partner's leg like so. I take my knee to the bottom of my partner's ankle and I just pinch my knees together. When she goes to extend me away, she can't. When she goes to bridge, she only has one leg to do so. And now from here, I take my time to go in and control like so. Because she only has one leg to move me around or bridge, it's not an easy thing to move around from here. When she goes to explosively extend her leg, move me around, very subtle, but it's very controlling. And then when you're ready, we slide the leg up, we slide the leg up, and we're ready to start passing. So, a little bit of leg riding there for you. When we get to that far foot grab, we don't want to pass right away. We want to kind of stay trapped in our partner's legs, making them think they can escape, or just moving at our own pace, a slower pace, and moving into a mounted position. All right, so now, what is the actual use of this far foot grab? Obviously, if we get to this far foot grab, and we get our partner's leg into this position, we can pretty much easily pass our partner at any given point when we have this unique grip. The problem is, you do this to someone, or someone even feels pressure on their leg, and the second you go to pull their leg and they freak out, they straighten their foot and they extend their leg away, so you can't pull their foot up to the hip line, and you can't connect their heel to their butt. So, you're like, okay, well, now what do I do? Whatever I see, I attempt to get to this foot grab. If my partner from here allows me to get it, it's going to be an issue. So, what everyone does is they feel me reaching for the leg, they go to palm on butterfly hook in, they feel me reaching for the leg, and take it out. And from here, when they feel me going to pull the foot up, they aggressively extend the leg away, and now from here, I can't get to the grip. This does two things. Number one, it makes your partner more cognizant and more timid when pummeling the butterfly hook in. If they know that if you get to the far foot and you pull it up, it's going to be pretty easy to pass, they're going to be very wary about trying to pummel a butterfly hook into place. So, their attempts at trying to pummel butterfly hooks in to then off balance you will usually decrease. So, they'll be more timid to pummel a butterfly hook in. In addition, what it does is it exposes my partner's far hip. When I'm in this position and my partner has a leg up high, it's a hard thing to get my elbow inside my partner's knee and use it effectively to walk my knee out to the floor and free my knee. So, what happens is I go to grab my partner's leg. The only way that she can hide that foot is by extending her leg out in the way. And that makes it easy now for me to expose the hip and bring my knee across. So, the real utility of this foot grab is a great pass in and of itself, but a lot of times you can't get to the grip, especially if you start to hit it two, three, four, five times on the people you're training with. They start to get used to it and they're like, no, I'm not giving you the foot. That's fine, but you can always expose the far hip now. So, the second my partner would start pummeling, I go to start taking this far foot. Now she goes to extend. The second I see this, I just take it forearm across my partner's thigh and immediately expose my partner's far knee or far hip like so with my knee. And now from here, I take my knee to the floor. We step back on our partner's legs and we start going into our passes from three quarter mount. So, the second I see my partner denied me the far foot grab, the only way she can deny the far foot grab is by exposing the far hip by extending her leg away from it. So, the second she's trying to pummel, pummel, pummel, I go to start grabbing. She goes to start extending. And now from here, we go in, we have three quarter mount, we can dominate the far hip and start passing from there. So, this is the real utility, the dilemma game between getting to the far foot grab. If they allow you to have it, you pass. You leg ride, you backstep, you step over to mount and you pass pretty easily from there. And if they deny it, which most times, especially people who know it's coming, most times they will deny it, but then they expose the far hip. You can take the inside elbow and slide right across the three quarter mount and pass from there. All right, so now, once our partner actually pummels the butterfly hook in, so we looked at as my partner's trying to pummel a butterfly hook in, we looked at going into some passes right away. We looked at grabbing our partner's foot as they're trying to repeatedly pummel a butterfly hook in. And now we're going to look at they pummel a butterfly hook in, I have a cross face, and let me start to pass from here. Now again, you can at any point switch to an underhook and a cross face and go into a high tripod and start to pass from here. This is another option that you have. So with the cross face, and my partner has a butterfly half guard, we're going to start passing to mount with that same knee direction dilemma we looked at before. Where if my partner tries to off balance me to one side and the knee points towards me, we're going to start to step over and go into a step over into mount. And if our partner starts to off balance me in the opposite direction away from her, over the far shoulder, then we're going to go into the inside elbow position. So very similar to what we did before. This time, instead of using an over back grip, we're going to have a cross face. So now we're going to be down. We're going to have a cross face. And again, I want to have my head close to her on the floor on this side. I want to have proper leg position with my lower body so that my partner can immediately off balance me. If I have a cross face and she has a butterfly hook, even if my head's in the floor and my hips are square from here, it's a pretty easy thing for her to start moving around and getting me off balance. I want to have a strong scissoring of my legs. I want to have a strong pinching of my knees. I want to have head on the floor. So now when she goes to off balance me over either shoulder, it's a very difficult thing to do from here. Now, she's going to be trying to start rocking in one direction or the other. So she's going to go right shoulder. She's going to go left shoulder. She's going to go right shoulder, left shoulder. And I have to stop her. If she can create enough momentum, eventually she's going to start to rock me around and then either get off balance this way or off balance me that way. So one of those times I have to make a choice on whether I'm going to use a post and step over or whether I'm going to go inside elbow. Both are very good. It just depends on where you catch your partner, when you feel comfortable going and what direction your partner's knee is pointing. So if your partner's knee, butterfly hook, your partner's knee points towards you and she goes to off balance you over the right shoulder, I just take a post hand like so and take a big step up and over and I pass right into a mounted position. Now more likely from here, she'll try to do everything she can to take that hand and post to my knee. I just take a hand right in here like so. And now she goes to start posting. We go in, we put an underhook in place. Or she takes a hand, she goes to start posting, take a hand down to the floor, we punch an underhook in. Or her hand's out here somewhere, we take a hand right down there ready to intercept. As she goes to post, we take that hand up and we start passing. So the knee points towards us. She's a sticky butterfly hook in place. Our partner points the knee towards us, goes to off balance me. We go in and we pass. This time our partner rocks towards us. She goes to off balance right, then she goes to off balance left. We take that knee through, we go three quarter mount and we start passing right from there. So we play a game where she goes to rock, I have tension, tension, tension. Then on one of those rocks, we make our transition. We go either into three quarter mount with an inside elbow or a big step over with a post on the knee. So we use that same dilemma we looked at before with the direction of our partner's knees. This time instead of using from an over back grip, we use it from cross face or chest to chest with our partner flattened out. So now let's look at inserting an underhook from either, when my partner has a butterfly half guard or a regular half guard. Let's look at how we can move between cross face and top head and arm. A big reason why people are so afraid to take the underhook out is because they say, okay, well what if I take the underhook out and I try to go in and post a knee, I can't free my leg and then I can't put an underhook back in and I just gave up the underhook and now I can't reinsert the underhook. So there's a specific way and a dilemma we have to create to go from just a cross face to getting an underhook back in place. Maybe you force half guard and maybe you end up, maybe you don't start with an underhook and a cross face or a top head and arm and you just start with the cross face and you want to put an underhook in place. You have to be able to move from locked hands to unlocked hands and from unlocked hands to locked hands and you have to know how to do this. So obviously if we're moving from a top head and arm to a cross face, we just unlock our hands and then go to a cross face. Now let's say we have just a cross face and for whatever reason we want to move back to an underhook. It's going to be hard from here to start going in and just punching an underhook. A lot of times from here my partner has her elbow in like so and I can't punch an underhook in, I can't get to an inside bicep tie and it's a difficult thing to do. If at any point I can get to the inside bicep tie, then we just go into our series where we lock our hands and we open up the elbow. Many times you can't even do that. So whenever I see whether my partner has a butterfly hook, whether my partner has a traditional half guard with locked legs, it doesn't make a difference. I'm going to look to start attempting to free my knee. So I play a game where I put the cross face in place and now from here I go in and I look to start freeing my knee like so. Or she has a butterfly hook in and I look to start freeing my knee like so. Your partner has a choice. She can accept three quarter mount and fight from there, which you're in the driver's seat when you're in three quarter mount, or she can stop you from freeing the knee by posting on your knee physically with her hand and stopping it from coming out and dominating the far head. So she can stop me from taking a knee out by posting on my leg and shoving it back into half guard. Okay. So now I can't drive the three quarter mount, but whenever she posts to my knee, she will always expose this hand to being this arm to being under hooked. So this is the dilemma we play. We move from a cross face to an under hook and we can move from a top head and arm just to a cross face by unlocking our hands. We can move back and forth now between the two instead of relinquishing the under hook and then not being able to insert it again. Whenever I want to punch an under hook in, I just post either on my partner's knee or inside my partner's hip and I threaten driving the three quarter mount. If your partner accepts this and you just pass them three quarter mount, if your partner doesn't accept this and they, the only way they can stop this is by posting on the knee. That's your time for an under hook. So we go in, I try to punch an under hook in, I just feel like it's just not there. So from here we take the inside elbow, we start walking, walking, walking, slide the knee through. She goes to punch that knee through, I blade my hand and we just take a hand in like so. Now we let her push it back down and as she does, we just open the elbow up and now from here we go in, we lock our hands, we go forward and we start going into high tripod positions. So we play a dilemma game between posting on the knee or using an inside elbow to get my knee down to the floor in three quarter mount. If your partner accepts that you pass, if your partner denies you that by posting on the leg, you will always be able to expose an under hook. I don't care how tight she keeps this elbow, I can always blade my hand and now she has to turn her hips in order to put me back in half guard. So she pushes, she turns the hips and she will always expose this under hook for me to go in and start going into high tripod passing with a top hand and arm. So basic but very important dilemma between three quarter mount and forcing an under hook and moving back to a top head and arm. Alright, so everything we've been doing so far has been built around using a cross face or using a top head and arm and assuming that my partner was just trying to fight me at the lower body and put my legs inside. There's always going to be a person out there who understands that if they use a near side hip post, they can off balance you as you go into a high tripod. And we have to, this is super important, we have to understand this. The purpose of a high tripod is to create a disconnection between my hips and my partner's hips. So if I'm in bottom position and she goes into a high tripod, it's hard for me to off balance her with a bridge, even though she's much smaller than me, if I just bridge, I can't off balance my partner because there's no hip to hip contact. If she's directly hip to hip and her knees are on the floor, now every time I go to bridge, I'm going to get big off balances. So to combat this, especially if there's a huge size difference, she goes into a high tripod where now she's inherently less stable because her knees are off the floor and her center of gravity is much higher. So she's inherently less stable, but I also have much less ability to off balance my partner. Okay. Now, if I use a near hip post, I don't have hip to hip contact, but I have hand to hip contact. So now when I bridge, I can transfer the energy of the bridge through my hand and into my partner's hips. And because my partner is inherently less stable with the hips higher than they were, it's an incredibly easy thing to use this hip post in conjunction with a bridge to start getting my partner off balance the second she goes into a high tripod. I can off balance my partner in either direction. She goes into a high tripod and from here, we're bringing the inside. She goes into a high tripod and she goes to start facing out. She just doesn't want me to take her over. We take our partner over and we start severely off balancing my partner. So you have to understand that the whole advantage of using a high tripod is to create separation in the hips. But when I go hand to hip, it's almost just as good and I can transfer the energy of the bridge into my partner's hips. And because the fact that she's inherently less stable because the center of gravity is higher, it makes it much easier for me to off balance her. So the job is yours from top position to understand where your partner's hands are. If your partner uses a post on the hips, you cannot go into a high tripod if your partner posts on the hip like so and they're halfway decent. You're going to get off balance and they're going to recover. So whenever I see a hip post comes into place from here, I have to address this before I go into a high tripod. And that's what we're going to start looking at now. All right. So now we're dealing with a pretty skilled opponent and whether she has a regular half guard or whether she has a butterfly half guard, it doesn't really make a difference. She has that near side hip post and she's looking to off balance me as I go into a high tripod. Whenever I see this, I don't move to a high tripod. I keep my hips low. So I'm more stable with a lower center of gravity. So the hip post doesn't really affect me as much. You still have to worry about the bridge because now you are hip to hip. So even though the cross hip or the near hip side hip post won't off balance you, the bridge can still off balance you. So just understand that. We're going to look to transition now from an under hook and a cross face, a top head and arm into a head block with an under hook. And how do we do this? So we go into a top head and arm and we feel that hand post is right on our hip. So we know now the second I go to high tripod, we're going to get off balanced. From this position, the first thing I look to do is I again look to start turning my hips out in this position like so and walking my partner's legs away from us. I had that proper lower body position where it's hard for her knee lever and also hard for her to insert a butterfly hook. Now from here, I go in and I just cut my partner's shoulder with my right hand. I pull myself forward. So if at any point she goes to paddle her left hand back to the inside position, she can't do it. Now I just block my partner's head. And now from here in one motion, I just take my head and I switch it across to the other side and I post my forehead on the floor and I go in ear to ear. Once I have this ear to ear position, we just go through, we catch our partner's neck and trap like so, and we control our partner in this fashion. And now from here, we have a situation where we have the luxury of the wedging of the cross face with my head position using this head block, but I have a free hand to work with and a much wider base of support. So from here, we got to transition from a top head and arm into a head block. From this position, we pull ourself in nice and tight like so. If possible, if you can get your partner's arm up high enough, I can make a transition early on right to the far trap. Many times from here, your partner will be pulling the elbow down, so it's hard to get to the far track right away. If the elbow is up high, I can get to the far track. I just lift my elbow and I make a transition to the far track. Many times we start by cupping the shoulder if the elbow is low, and now from here, we post the head. Now we block our partner's head like so. She goes to start moving around from here and I take my head to the opposite side and I wedge the head in place. Now from here, I have a post hand and I have an under hook and essentially a cross face. From here, we start playing a game. We look to start working as my partner goes to move around, bridge me around, we push with the head, we bring the head out and away from us so that my partner's far ear and shoulder connect. That now will allow me to take my hand through, walk my hand through, and get to this far trap grip. Now I have this tight wedge around my partner's upper body, head, and shoulders, and now we can start to go in and work to pass from this position with various passes from here. Making a transition from a top head and arm into a head block and an under hook. Now once we move our head across this head block position, we're going to look to convert it up to over-unders. You can pass if your partner doesn't have a hip post. You can willingly just take your head from one side to the other and relinquish the cross face and put a head block in place and pass from there. It gives you a wider base of support. Even if your partner doesn't have a post on your hip and you just want a wider base of support because you're afraid of a bridge or off balance or whatever the case is, it's always a good choice to take your head from one side with the top head and arm to the other side with the head block and then it gives you wider base of support while still having good wedging with your partner's head and shoulders trapped. Now when I move to the over hook side, or when I move my head to the opposite side, I have to be able to clear my partner's hip post. There's a certain way that we do this. The first thing you have to understand is why my partner can't hit a knee lever when I turn my hip and I put my opposite hip down. When I take my head across my partner's far shoulder, I have to have my hips turned in this direction slightly so that my left hip is lower than my right hip. If at any point my left hip is higher than my right hip and my right knee is down, she can knee lever me. This is because of the fact that my head is across the center line towards the far shoulder in the direction that she wants to knee lever. If my head is on the opposite side in any position and she goes to knee lever, there's too much weight on the wrong side of the center line for the knee lever. So my head's in the floor over here, I can take my left knee all the way off the floor. When she goes to knee lever me, it's just not going to happen. So I play a game now where I want to clear this hip post and if my left hip is down, it's hard for me to clear this hip post because now I'm pulling my partner's hand directly into my hip. So I put my right knee down like so and I turn my hips in the wrong, the opposite direction. So that now from here, when she goes to knee lever me, she can't do it because my head's on the wrong side. And because I'm turning my left hip up, the hand now will always slip off of the hip. When she goes to keep a strong hip post, I just put right here, there's no way I can clear the post. So I go in, I try to, I'm going to put my right knee down, she goes to knee lever and simultaneously keep the hip post, she can't do it either. Now from here I can either play with a grip here on my partner's tricep or we can go in elbow to elbow and play and start passing here. Both are very good, I don't prefer one or the other, you can use both of them. You can play around with which one works for you, but I don't prefer either one. And now from here, when I start to go in and pass, only the upper body grips change. The purpose of the upper body grip change where my head comes from one side to the other and I switch to over under versus double under. The reason why I do this is to stop my partner from posting in my hip and off balancing me when I go into a high tripod. That's the why. Why I would use under over versus top head and arm is to deal with this hip post. Now when I have this over under position, all the passes remain the same. All the lower body leg pommeling will remain the same. I look to insert a butterfly hook if I can't and block my partner's hip. I can go across and I can control my partner's far hip. I can use top pommels, I can use front pommels, I can do all the exact same lower body pommels as I did before, but now my partner has no ability to off balance me with this near hip post. So once I actually have control of this arm, now I can go into a high tripod. I don't go into a high tripod before I clear the arm. So she posts on the hip, I make the transfer of the head, now I clear my partner's hand like so. Now from this position we go in and we start posting the head on the floor. Now I start building to a high tripod. When she goes to post to my hip and off balance me, she can't. When she goes to start bridging and off balancing me, she can't. And now from here I play a game. I pommel on side and I pass. Then I move to my cross face. I play a game where I insert a knee. Butterfly hook comes in and now from here we go in and we pass. I play a game where I can go in, I can dominate the far hip with the knee, I can shoot a leg free, I can go in and I can pass. She's a butterfly hook, same idea. I go in, I top pommel, I start passing. I can go in, I can front pommel, I can start passing. I can go in, I can dominate the far hip, and I can start passing. So all of my lower body pommels remain the same. The reason why I'm transferring from a top head and arm into a head block and then to double over hooks is simple. Sorry, over hook, under hook is simple. It's to stop someone from off balancing me in a high tripod position with a hip post. So now we're going to look to convert to double unders. Double unders is the best passing position we can be in in half guard for a couple of reasons. Number one, most of the time with the head block position you're blocking your partner's field of vision so they can't actually see what you're doing and you're just beating them in a leg pommeling battle. Number two, they have almost no ability to start posting. They can't post on your hip at all. They have no ability to start posting on your knees to stop you from passing them and recovering into any kind of half guard or full guard. They can't beat you in a pommeling battle. A lot of times with the over under, they bridge and they off balance. You can post a hand and they can bring their hand back inside, but with double unders it's just none of that. You can play with your head on both sides. And the head position is a really interesting thing because I've been working on it for a long time and I was thinking to myself a couple of months ago, why would I play with my head on one side versus the other side? So let's have a little discussion on that right now. And obviously this is all a work in progress for me too. Passing half guard is something that I've been working on for a long time and I feel like I'm still just not even halfway there with how good I can be with passing half guard. So this is something I've been thinking about a lot in these recent months. When I go to make a conversion to double underhooks, again, I don't want to be high tripod-ing off of the hip post because my partner can immediately off balance me. So I move to this head block, she posts a hip, and from here I turn my knee down, I turn my hip down, and from here I just take a hand inside like so. Now if at any point my partner has an elbow so close where I just can't get it inside, that's fine. We've got the outside of the elbow and now we just turn the hip and the knee down and we just go right to under hook. So that's our cue. If we see that our partner has an elbow that's flared out in a way, it's a pretty easy thing to go to double unders. If we see she's doing a good job of keeping the elbow tight, then a lot of times we can't get it or we have to work to get it and we can take our time to do it or we can just settle for over under. Both are very good and both will lead you into passing positions. But just a general rule, the tighter the elbow, the more chance you go to over under and the wider the elbow from the body, the more chance that you go to a double under. So we go in, this time, we see we can go in, we take an under hook like so, and now we just flare our elbow out as we turn the hip, the left hip up, the right hip down, and we just pop that hip post up. Now it won't slide completely off, she'll still be trying to post, but from here I just walk, walk, walk, walk my hip away and I put my forearm on the floor. She goes to start taking that hand down and from here I just walk, walk, walk the hand up. Now we can put our hands in one of two positions. I usually start with a cupping of the shoulders like so, so I can pull my hand up into a locked position. Right now, if I find her pulling her elbows down, it's a hard thing to go right to a locked to a 10 finger grip. So from here, the first thing I do is as my partner goes to pull the elbows down, I just lean forward, I cup the shoulders and I use that to pull my elbows back and propel my body forward. As I do so, the weight leaning forward and a combination of that and my elbows coming back to my hips will just inherently start to rise my partner's elbows. Even though my elbow's coming back towards my hips, when she goes to bring the elbows down, I'm pulling my body forward. So the elbows will come up a little bit. Now from here, I just start opening up my elbows and I just start walking forward like so. And now what I don't do is I don't try to lift my arms against her arms pulling down. It's not the idea here. The idea is to pull myself towards my partner and use body weight to elevate her elbows. Okay? So I'm not going to just jump right away to having her elbows way above her head and lock my hands. I play a time-based game where she goes to start pulling her elbows down. I first pull myself in. So she gets to pull the elbows down. Notice as I pull myself forward, the elbows rise a little bit. And now from here, she goes to start moving around. I just play a game where I just work my elbows up high over time by leaning my body weight forwards like so. And now when I get the chance, if I ever do, and you don't have to lock your hands, you can keep your hands in this position here. But if I ever do get the chance to lock my hands, I suggest locking with a 10 finger grip like so right underneath your partner's neck and leaning forward with the head down to the floor. Okay? So I look to go in and punch double underhooks in and I look to get my elbows, if I can, higher than my partner's shoulder line. It won't always be the case, but this is what we're looking to do. This is optimal right here. Now in terms of discussing head position, when I'm passing my partner's guard, you can pass to either side now because you have symmetrical hand positions on both sides. You have double underhooks. So whether you pass the side control on this side or side control on this side, you're going to have the same hand position in the upper body position. Your head will just be slightly further to one side than the other, and you can switch that pretty easily. So what I generally recommend is that your head stays in the near side here. If you're going to pass to this side and you're going to put two legs on this side of your partner's body, and I started in half guard on the right side, or if I'm going to pass to mount, I generally recommend keeping my head on the same side. It blocks your partner's line of sight and there's no reason for the extra movement to take your head across to the opposite side because the more movement you have, you're trying to negate movement from here. So the more you take your head from one side to the other, the more chance he has of bridging, off balancing you, taking your hands back to the inside position and messing you up from there. In addition, with your head on this side, it makes it harder for her to knee lever as we spoke about before. So in general, if I'm going to pass to the right side in this case or to mount in this case, I keep my head on that side. If I'm going to pass to side control on the opposite side and take my two feet across the body, then I'll generally transition my head to the other side somewhere during the pass. So the pommel is going to remain the same from here, just as we spoke about before, but my head position will change throughout the pass. So from here, I go in, I get to my head block, she posts to my hip. From here, she has a nice deep half guard, she'll have to start turning, sorry, not deep half guard, deep half guard with the legs. And from here we go in, we start turning like so, we go in and we punch the hand to the floor. Now, she goes to keep the hip post, I just walk my hips away and I open up the elbow. Keep your hand tight, Pence. I just open up the elbow and slide my elbow down to the floor. Now from here we go in, we take a cups, two cups on our partner's shoulders. She goes to start pulling the elbows down, I drive forward and that raises the elbows. Now from here, she goes to move, I just play a game where I just walk elbows up like so. Now if I can, I go and I start locking. Now your pommeling game again is the same right from here. We have nice high elbows and we play this pommeling game. As we go into a high tripod, she goes to start bridging, she can't. She goes to post in the hip, she can't. And now from here, we go in, we play the same pommeling game. I'm passing to this side or if I'm passing to mount, I generally keep my head right where it is. The only time I'll take my head to the opposite side is if I'm passing fully across the opposite side to side control. So for example, if I go in, I start high tripod-ing, walking, I go to start passing and taking my knee down to the floor. From here, a lot of times my partner's trying to turn back in the direction towards me. She's trying to turn her hips in this direction. So it's kind of awkward from here. So from here, I'll take my head across to the far side. Now more of my body weight's leaning in the side I want to pass to. Now when she has to turn towards me, it's much more difficult. So when I see my partner trying to defend a pass in this direction, by aggressively turning towards me, I'll lean more of my body weight over to the side that I want to pass to. So you can see the transfer of the head position as you go. If I go in here, I start trying to take my knee across. I feel my partner's not letting me get all the way across. She's pointing her knees towards me, and I feel like I'm getting kind of in an awkward off-balance state from here. So I drive my knee across, and from here I transfer my head position. So now when she has to start moving me in the opposite direction, it's not nearly as easy. So from here we can go in, we can pass with side control, and we can go in and get our top pin nice and strong right from there. Now again, this is just a general rule. I can start with a pass to this side, which if my partner's trying to face me, maybe I can't even get started if my head stays on the near side. So I go in, I walk towards my partner's hips, I take my head to the far side. Now I start driving across, I go to pass to this side, my partner tries to face me, she can't do it because all my weight's laying to the wrong side. Now maybe I shoot my leg free, and now maybe from here, instead of passing to this side, we go in, we pass to the same side that we were on, or maybe we pass to mount. So it's a very general rule, but rules are always made to be broken. So the general rule, if I'm passing, if I'm in my partner's right side half guard, and I'm passing to her right, or I'm passing to mount straight from there, I generally keep my head on the near side. If I have to start taking my knee across the hip to control my partner's hips, and I start passing across to the far side, and so I control on the opposite hip, then a lot of times I'll take my head from the near side to the far side to make it hard for my partner to start turning back into me, from driving everything across to the far side. And you can play between near side and far side, and start moving around as you're comfortable, and work from there to start passing your partner. Double underhooks are so, so strong as far as pinning your partner, and if you do pass into side control, it makes it almost impossible for your partner to recover with a side guard, because they can't bring the knee to the elbow. So it's very easy to move from double underhooks, pass into side control, and then immediately moving to mount without having the danger of them re-guarding as you go to move from side control to mount by locking a side guard and giving you issues. So before we move on to our opponent having an offensive underhook and looking to go in and start attacking us, we're going to look at the recap of this chest-to-chest passing. And really now we have pretty generalized rules as to why we would use one hand position versus another. First we look at our opponent's lower and upper body leg and hand positioning. We look at does our partner have legs locked in a triangle? Is our partner trying to knee lever us? Is our partner trying to go into butterfly hooks? And does our partner have a hip post at the near hip? Based around butterfly hooks or triangles, we pass in certain ways. And we can pass with a top-headed arm usually or just a cross face. And if my partner puts in a butterfly hook, generally before going to a high tripod, I generally stay with low hips and use a cross face to pass. But you can also go into a high tripod and use a top-headed arm to start passing against a butterfly hook. And in general, if I'm passing in a high tripod and my partner pommels a butterfly hook in, I try to just pommel my own butterfly hook in or dominate the hips in another way and go into a pass or hip switch pass and go into a pass and fight from there. Now more importantly, so we looked at tons of pommels from there, but more importantly than that, when I'm passing from half guard and I'm chest to chest, if my partner is using a near side hip post, this is when things get interesting. If your partner uses a near side hip post, we have to start transferring the head across from one side to the other, going from a cross face and under hook, a top-headed arm into a head block. And then off of the head block, we can start using under over hooks or double under hooks to start passing, clearing that post, that hip post, and then going into passes. You cannot high tripod when your partner has a hip post. You're going to get severely off balance. And a lot of times because your hands are locked and your base of support isn't that wide, you could take an over into bottom position and end up either in the bottom half guard or bottom side control. And then you did all that work to probably take your partner down, force them into a half guard, get past the top arm and top leg, and get them chest to chest. And then you just make a simple mistake like going into a high tripod with a hip post, and then you get rolled over into bottom position and you did all that work for nothing. So we looked at the whys of one hand position versus another. So in general, I'm passing from a top-headed arm. That's all fine and great. Top-headed arm is a great position. I usually go into most of my passes from there because most people don't post in the near hip. But if they do post in the near hip, that's the time to start changing our head position to a head block and going with over under or double under. And a great way to counteract my partner having a butterfly hook is by keeping my hips low and using a cross face, start walking my partner's legs away and start stepping over into mount and passing like that. And then we also looked at a unique technique that you really haven't seen in competition, which is the far foot grab as my partner goes to the pommel in, where we can go in and create a dilemma between pulling my partner's foot in and then going into passes from there. Or if they deny you that, taking the inside elbow or posting the knee and then sliding to three quarter mount. So a variety of different things and not only how to do things, but why you would use one grip versus another is super important for your understanding and your development as a student of these instructionals. So now we're going to move on to our opponent who comes up, gets to an under hook and looks to go into offense with either trying to come up into single legs and get up to tight waist and start taking her back or taking us down. And then combining that with rolling through and going into deep half guard and stuff like that. So now we're going to go into building into defenses from my opponent who comes up and gets to under hook like everybody likes to use. Now my partner is generally going to have a couple of different approaches from here. She can use an under hook with locked legs as a triangle, or she can use an under hook with a butterfly hook. So the goals will be a little bit different from each of these positions. If my partner comes up and gets to an under hook, and she builds up to an elbow like so, she's generally going to be trying to play a game where number one, she either comes up to her knees and goes in and tries to start wrestling me, whether she sticks to the tight waist, whether she moves my leg, whether she starts moving around and starts trying to take my back, whatever the case is, where she builds up to her knees and then goes into attacks from there. Or she'll play a game where she comes up to her knees, and now from here, as I go to start putting a strong wizard pressure in, she'll start rolling me through and then switching and then taking me over. Or she'll start to roll back into half guard and then start going into deep half guard and pulling me in and starting to off balance me and going into all of her deep half guard game. So she'll play a game where she either tries to build up to her knees. If she feels she can't build to her knees, she'll go back in the opposite direction and start scooping legs and rolling me through. Or she'll play a game where she's up on an elbow, and now from here, she goes in and starts trying to scoop my leg and just immediately start going in and start rolling me through from this position. And then from here, if I post my hand out and stop, then she'll have to come back up to her knees and start to go in on leg attacks or back attacks. So she'll play a basic dilemma game between trying to build to her knees and roll underneath me to get some kind of off balance to either enter into my legs, enter into deep half guard, or start building up and go get to leg attacks wrestling wise, or going to expose my back. From a situation where she has an under hook and she's a butterfly half guard, where she's a butterfly hook inserted, now things are going to be a little bit different from here. Because now she will come up to her knees from here, but she'll play a game where she starts trying to off balance me in a multitude of directions, whether it be from here, she goes in and she starts to off balance me with sumigeshi over to her right side, and then she looks to start going into inversions and entering into my legs, like so. So she'll look to go into sumigeshi with a half butterfly guard and start to off balance me from here, or what she'll start to do is she'll off balance me in one direction, as I get a push back she'll scoop inside my legs, and I'll actually go into some kind of deep half guard, or actually grab me on the far side, and start playing a game going into attacks from there. So there's always going to be this pull push dilemma game where your partner tries to push into you, and then if there's success, then she gets her attack off. If you push back into her too far, then she uses the momentum to go back in the opposite direction and starts to off balance you. So in general, when your partner's playing with an underhook and they have legs triangled in a traditional half guard, it's a fight between them coming up to their knees and going into attacks, or rolling through, getting underneath you and going into attacks. When they have butterfly hooks in place, they generally won't be coming up towards you, they'll be looking to off balance you over one shoulder, and then as you get a push back, they'll switch directions and off balance you under the second shoulder to get underneath you, control your center of gravity, and then go into their attacks from there. So just a little intro to what they're going to be doing from this underhook position. Now let's look at stopping my partner from initially pommeling an underhook in place. So first she's going to be down with this half guard in place, and the first thing, this basic elbow position, we're going to keep our elbows inside. She's usually going to have a cross shoulder post and some kind of knee shield from here, and now from here she's going to look to try to play a game where she kicks the knee shield out, she brings the elbow forward, and then she moves to an underhook. Just very basic elbow position here. The second my partner goes to start kicking this through, I just take my elbow and I just tuck it in like so. At any point she goes to tuck an elbow inside, it's a difficult thing to do. It seems simple, but it's worth mentioning. She's obviously trying to get the elbow inside my elbow, get the inside position, so if I keep my elbow connected to my ribcage, it's going to be a hard thing to do. So I play a game where she goes in, and the second I see my partner going to punch under her again, I just move back and away, and I cover my partner's far shoulder with my head position. So when she goes to start coming towards me and punching the underhook in, I just monitor that far shoulder, and instead of crashing the far shoulder and coming forward, I just move backwards and I let the shoulder come to me. So she goes to start punching that underhook in, and we just block that shoulder like so, and now from here we go in and we make sure we post on our partner's bottom leg. So she tries to recover to a full open guard from here, again we force that leg back down, and we can start going in and stepping over the knee. Now as my partner goes to punch the underhook in, I can always go in and immediately take a reverse crossface. Ultimately, what she needs to do is she needs to get a connection of her shoulder, my armpit, and her head underneath my chest in order to put an effective underhook in place. So the second I see this happening, she goes to come forward, and I just take an initial reverse crossface like so. So now she can never form that shoulder to armpit connection, and she can never get her head underneath my chest. And now when she goes to start coming forward towards me, we can either one, take an underhook where my hand swims inside first, and we punch in an underhook, and now from here when my underhook comes in, now when she goes to start taking her arm back inside and pummeling in, we can go in, crash her far shoulder, and get to a top-headed arm a lot of the times. So she goes to start coming in, we block with a reverse crossface, we take our hand to the inside position, and now from here we come forward. Now from this position we come forward, I look to go in, and look to start flattening our partner out with this initial top-headed arm. We can also go elbow first. So I go in, I feel like my hand's not going to be enough, I won't be able to get inside, so from here this time we can take our elbow to the inside position. And now, instead of pummeling my whole hand in, we just go to an inside bicep tuck. Now when she goes to come forward, we just dive forward, we switch to a crossface, which we can always do because my partner's elbow is occupied on the floor. But now we use this inside bicep tuck and crossface to crash her far shoulder, she goes to start coming forward, we drive our partner down, then we use that ten-finger grip that we love so much to start exposing underhooks on our partner. So we play a game where she goes to start coming forward, I get head position at first and I stop her from getting the underhook. If she gets in deep where the underhook comes into place, we use a reverse crossface. Now from here, we're either one, pummel a hand inside, and we move right to a top-headed arm, or two, from here we take an elbow inside first, like so, and then as she goes to repummel and sit back, we just follow her. Follow, follow, follow, follow, and then we flatten her out. So we can go hand first and go to an underhook, or if we feel like the hand isn't going to have space to come in, maybe she's here and I feel like the hand can't get in there, then from here I'll just move out and away and the elbow will come inside. Now if she tries to repummel and beat me, we just go in, we crash her far shoulder, we start putting that far shoulder on the floor. There's just a couple ways, a couple basic ways to not only avoid an initial underhook from her part, but also to repummel quickly as she goes to punch an underhook in before she's really established the underhook, using that reverse crossface to pummel either a hand or an elbow inside and crash the far shoulder into an offensive chest-to-chest position. All right, so now let's say our partner actually gets to an underhook, they have good position, they have that shoulder-to-armpit connection, they have their head underneath my chest, and we want to pummel back to an underhook initially. How can we do this? There's a couple of grips we can use from this position once you get to an underhook. We can use a whizzer like so, so my partner can't get to my back obviously, we can't have no grip at all because now my partner just bumped me forward and gets to my back. So we put a whizzer in place so it's hard for her to start moving towards my back, or we could use a V-grip like so. Now when I use the V-grip, I have to make sure that I get my head, my chin, over my partner's elbow. If I use the V-grip and my partner manages to bump me forward, the V-grip doesn't do anything, it slips out, and then you end up with your back taken anyways. So I either use a tight whizzer like so, or I use a V-grip if I can get my chin over my partner's elbow, or at least moving towards my partner's elbow. So if I see my partner has a deep underhook and it's very high up in place, and from here I feel like the V-grip's not going to be working, then I stick with the whizzer. If not, and it's relatively low down towards my waist or even on my leg, then I can use a V-grip. Now I want to go ahead and start pummeling back into my own underhook, and she has a good underhook in place, I just sit back towards my heels and I look to start taking my chin over my partner's elbow, like so, and crushing the underhook down, whether it be with a whizzer or with this V-grip. And now from here, we're in a situation where my partner no longer has that shoulder to armpit connection, she no longer has a deep underhook, and she no longer has her head underneath my chest. And now we just go right back to the same position where we go in, we put the reverse crossface, we pummel back inside. Or from the V-grip, same thing, we put the reverse crossface, we pummel back inside, like so. And now we can move from a situation where she has a deep underhook, she's threatening me from this position, we go in, we look to start leaning towards our partner's far hip. The reason why I do this is to take weight off my left hand. She has weight on my left hand, I can never put that reverse crossface in place. So from this position, I start leaning my body and turning my body, then as she gets to put weight on my left hand, I move to this position first. Now I have a weightless left hand, we can put our hand in position, pummel inside. She gets to start off-balancing me, I have weight off my left hand, we can pummel the hand in, take our hand inside, go in, and start flattening our partner out and going into all of our passes. So this time our partner actually gets to a strong underhook, and we use a series of hand pummeling to get back to the position that we want, and we can start to go in and flatten our partner out and go into our passing from there. This time, our partner gets to an underhook, and we can of course just sit to our overback grip. So now, our partner moves to an underhook, and she gets to start putting this underhook in place. At any time I want to start going in, I can just take my hand, my elbow, up and over my partner's back like so. As I do this, I block my partner's hip with my right hand. What I don't want is to try to sit to an overback grip, and she throws the underhook up high, and I get thrown to the floor. So from here, I take my body into that same position where I angle my body out, my head moves down towards my partner's far hip, so I can get my chin over my partner's elbow the best I can, and I drop my hand down to the floor like so. Now we go in, and we just reach over our partner's back. Now from this position, I just start leaning towards my partner's far shoulder. She can start backing up her elbow and walking with me, but it's only a matter of time until I eventually can flatten my partner out. From this position, she goes to start walking backwards with this elbow, and I just walk, walk, walk. I flatten my partner out, and now we're in the same overback grip that we were in before, and I can start working pretty intelligently and effectively from this position. So I can always convert her underhook into my overback grip. Because she's bringing herself towards me, it makes it easy to get control over my partner's head with an overback grip. She's never going to be using this knee shield in conjunction with an underhook. The knee shield is looked to maintain distance between my chest and her chest, and the underhook is made to close distance between the two of us. So she's willingly bringing her head towards me so she can go into attacks, but because she's coming towards me, it makes the overback grip easy to sit into. So we go in, she gets to her underhook, and from this position, we just move to this angle here. The second she goes to punch it in, I move into this position. Now we go in, and we just reach over our partner's back. Now as my partner goes to start keeping me from knocking her over, I just lean and start circling. I just walk with her. I'm not actually walking a circle in this direction. I just walk with her as I start leaning towards the far shoulder. She can walk as much as she wants. She can do it one, two, three, four, five times, but eventually she's going to end up flattened out. We're going to end up in this overback grip, and I'm ready to start working right from here. So we sit to an overback grip and start working. If at any point my partner denies the overback grip, and she's like, oh man, this is not good, I go to sit to this overback grip, and she goes to aggressively pull everything back. Now that hand that was on the hip right here just paddles right to an inside bicep tuck. So if she's like, oh man, I don't want this overback grip, she has to kind of force into the overback grip because at least the overback grip is better than being flattened out. So she has a choice of either being flattened in the overback grip or controlled in the overback grip or flattened out chest to chest. So if at any point she's like, oh man, this is no good, and pulls herself back and away, and I just transition from the overback grip to a cross face, I take my hand inside, we use this inside bicep tuck to start going in and flattening our partner out. We play a dilemma game between sitting to an overback and flattening our partner out if they deny the overback. So she's in underhook, we go in, we sit to this overback grip. From here she has to stay in her elbow. It's not an easy thing. Even if she walks aggressively backwards away from me, she's going to get beat from here. Now from this position, we go in, we try to sit to this overback grip. She aggressively pulls away and moves here. She goes to start taking everything out and away, and we take a backhand frame on her own head and flatten her partner out. What this backhand frame allows us to do, Dylan, is that if she goes halfway and now she tries to come back towards me, the backhand frame will not allow her to. I don't go into an inside bicep tuck here because now it's my hand pushing against her ability to come forward. I'm basically trying to tricep press her down to the floor. When she goes to sit up, she's going to win this battle. So instead I use a backhand frame where now it's the weight of my body crashing the far shoulder. If she goes halfway and then tries to get back up, there's no way she can. And now from here, we go in, we lock our hands and we can. We start playing a game now where we can fight to the inside position. We play a basic overback dilemma where if our partner allows us to get to the overback, then we just sit to the overback grip from her underhook, or if she pulls away and we use an inside bicep tuck to flatten my partner out and work from chest to chest. And now that we looked at crushing our partner's underhook and moving into positional games, we can also look at going into submissions. So from here, this time she punches in an underhook and now we're creating this angle where we start crushing our partner's underhook like so. Now from this position, I play a combination of a darse with an overback. So initially I'm going to sit over my partner's head like so, but I'm not going to sit all the way to my hip this time with the intention of flattening my partner out. I'm just going to sit to this overback grip and I'm going to keep my hips square. If I turn my hips towards my partner's hips, it's because I'm trying to sit to an overback and flatten my partner out for a positional game. This time I'm going to turn my hips in the opposite direction slightly. I'm going to drop my right shoulder into the pocket of my partner's hip like so. And now I'm going to use this overback to initially control my partner. So when she goes to move away from me from here, it's not an easy thing. Now from here, we just come in and we catch a 10 finger grip like so. Once we have this 10 finger grip, this is all we need. My partner goes to start moving around now, which is going to be a difficult thing from here. And now we just focus on putting that back down to the floor. Now as always, we come in and we look to start taking an ear to our partner's back. So when she goes to start putting the back to the floor, it's not going to be an easy thing. Now from here we go in, we lock our darse up, and now we can go in and start finishing and playing all the darse finishers that we looked at before. So we use the threat of a darse to start attacking when our partner punches an underhook in. The first thing is we have a whizzer or we have a V grip in our partner's armpit. She has to start punching the armpit in. My whole thing is to take the angle away from her. She wants me facing her in the same direction as her so that our bodies are aligned. So now if she goes to come up, it's a pretty easy thing. I go to the floor, go back. If she goes to roll through, our bodies are aligned and I have a limited base of support. So instead, I start creating an angle which forms this T between our two bodies. So now if she goes to start coming up towards me, it's hard to even pull her leg out. She can't use the underhook. If she goes to start rolling, I can sit back towards my heels. I can post a hand on the floor. I have much more balance from here and I'm in a much better position. So I start creating this angle like so. And now from here, I sit to this over back grip but I don't switch my hips. I pull my partner's head in with this over back grip the best I can. I shoot a hand through. And now from here we go in and we lock 10 fingers. From here, we just start leaning towards our partner's far shoulder and we put that shoulder on the floor. We wedge the back in place. She goes to pull the back to the floor. She can't do it. Then we go in, we lock up and of course we go through our tightening and we can go in and start finishing our partner from there. So she punches an underhook and we just immediately go in, threaten a dark strangle because there's extension of the arm and we can go in and take advantage of that extension, feed a dark string, then go into either submissions or attacks right from there. Okay, so now we're going to talk about our opponent goes to an underhook. We try to go to a dorsal. They defend the dorsal by bringing the chin away from the chest. Now understand from here as always, she goes to come in, she put the underhook in place. I go for the dorsal. I'm trying to crunch her chin to her chest. So right from here, as I go to crunch her chin to her chest, she aggressively goes to throw her back, back to the floor and pull away from me and that chin will naturally move away from her chest. So from here, the second I see that my partner goes to pull out and away from me, I just follow her down to the floor and I immediately take my hand inside my partner's bicep. So from here, as she goes to pull away, she goes to pull away from me, she exposes herself to the cross face. Now from here, I take my hand inside my partner's bicep and I put that backhand frame in place. She goes to pull her back to the floor and she ends up flattened out in a situation where I can go in and start attacking from chest to chest. As always, if my partner goes halfway and then she's like, oh man, I don't want to get flattened out, this backhand frame prevents her from coming back in the direction she just came from. So when she goes to start aggressively turning towards me now, the backhand frame will always flatten her out and then move into a cross face. And now I play a game where I just wait until her elbow comes to the outside position and now we get to that 10-finger grip. So we play a game where I play dilemma between threatening a dorsal and flattening my partner out. Now the dilemma is so powerful because of the fact that my partner has an underhook, her head is underneath my chest. So there's no ability to expose a cross face from here. My hand's on the floor and even if I create an angle, it's hard to create a cross face. She has her head buried way inside. It's hard to get a strong cross face from here. So I have to do something to expose her jaw to a cross face. So I go in, I take this dorsal grip like so. Now she willingly brings her chin away from her chest and moves aggressively away from me. I just loop around the other side of her head and a strong cross face comes into place now. There's a cross face exposure and I can expose her jaw and get a deep bite in the cross face. She goes to pull herself back down to the floor. We take this backhand frame and we start crashing the far shoulder. As the elbow comes out, we go in, we lock up. We play a great dilemma game between threatening a dorsal. If the chin stays crunched to the chest, the dorsal is inevitable. If my partner aggressively moves back and away, then she exposed herself to the cross face and we can easily flatten them out and go in from work chest to chest. Now another great submission that we can start threatening when my partner moves to underhook is the arm and gi team. When my partner moves to this underhook, we have the ability to start going in and going to this arm and gi team like so. Now obviously, like we talked about before, if my partner does manage to come on top of me because of the fact that I have my feet inside, I can use a sumi gechi to start returning my partner to bottom position and I can go into the previous series that we looked at before. Another great option we have once we go into this gi team is that from here, we go into the gi team and now we can start leaning over our partner's far shoulder. Now as we go to lean over our partner's far shoulder, from here, I take my chest and I cover my partner's far shoulder like so. So that now from here, as I'm going to lean towards my partner's far shoulder, she goes to start backing up with her elbow. It's a pretty easy thing to start leaning, leaning, leaning and then from here, I put my head down on the floor. Now in order to avoid smashing your face into the floor, because it's slightly terrifying to go to bring your head down towards the floor and if your partner rolls that direction, you spike your head into the floor. So when I go to put my head down on the floor, the first thing I do is I take my elbow and I flare it out. So the first thing to make contact is not my head, it's my elbow. So my elbow goes down first, my head goes down second and this will help break your fall a little bit so you get a good head post instead of just smashing your face into the floor. And worst case scenario, you can always, if your partner goes to roll you through, you can post your hand on the floor. She goes to aggressively roll, I can post my hand on the floor and now from here I can go back to the arm in and I can start to go into attacks. Now when I go into this arm in guillotine, we can start to go into passes from here. My partner is going to have to take her hands up provided the threat of the guillotine is actually strangling her. She's going to have to start hand fighting. So from here, I slap my partner out, I start putting heat on the guillotine and the hands come up defensively. Now once the hands come up defensively, I like to start going into a tripod from here. Like so. She's a high half guard. And now from here, we play a game where I just start going in and pommeling my feet in the same way that I normally would if I had a top head and arm. But the whole time, I'm strangling my partner with the guillotine. So I play a leg pommeling game similar to the one that I looked at when I have my legs trapped in a traditional half guard or even with a butterfly half guard, but we do it with some upper body grips. Or some different upper body grips. So from here, we go in, we use this guillotine, start putting our partner's far shoulder down on the floor. We go in, we take our head out over the far shoulder, she goes to start defending the guillotine, we go into a high tripod. She has to keep me trapped. From here we play a game where we come through and we use the guillotine grips to use the same leg pommeling methods we've been using this whole time, but with a thread of a guillotine controlling our partner the whole time. Then when she goes to out pommel me from here, we can pommel past our partner's legs relatively easily from here. We use the thread of the guillotine to get our partner's hands occupied, up hand fighting against the guillotine, and then from there we can go in and start playing a game where we can pommel our legs in the same fashion and pass our partner and get either side control or go into mounted positions. Just like with the D'Arce, with the guillotine, my whole thing with the strangle is to get chin to chest action to start threatening a strangle and then playing a leg pommeling game to get past my partner's guard. Now the D'Arce and the guillotine are a little bit different because if you lock a D'Arce your partner has to disengage the half guard and then they can start to work from there. They basically have to give you a pass or at least let you pass the legs in order to not get strangled. Whereas with the guillotine, they can kind of keep their legs locked, keep you locked in the half guard and you have to use the previous leg pommeling sequences to get past. So it's a little bit different, but as far as them pulling away from you and you trying to crunch the chin to the chest, you'll have the same initial reaction. So we're in a half guard and my partner tries to start pulling out and away from me from the guillotine. Whenever I see this, we again just transition from that control of the head, the guillotine to a cross face. We crash the far shoulder. From here we go in and start passing from chest to chest. So the same thing as we did with the D'Arce, we can also do with the guillotine. So she comes forward and now from here we go in, we try to start putting our far shoulder on the floor. We try to start finishing from here and now as she goes to start pulling away, she says, oh no, this is not good. This guy has a good guillotine. She goes to pull away and we go in, we start flattening our partner out and we get success putting the far shoulder on the floor and we play a dilemma game between threatening a guillotine and putting a strong guillotine in place and her having her move out and away to deny me control of the head and then as she goes to move out and away, we crash the far shoulder and work from chest to chest. All right, so now let's look at a dilemma that we can play as far as attacking goes with this guillotine and this D'Arce triangle. So usually what I like to do from here is I always love to start by going into a D'Arce. So from here as my partner goes to not only will she start taking her back to the floor, but what she can also start doing is start pulling her elbow back towards her hip because ultimately what I need for a D'Arce is I need this position here where her ear and her bicep are almost connected or connected. So I go for this D'Arce, she'll pull everything back and now from here, this allows me to start taking the guillotine through and getting my hands into position where I can get them up high by my partner's shoulder. The issue is if I go for a guillotine from here and my partner's arm is too close to her, too close to her shoulder, I can't actually get a guillotine into place. So a lot of times I start going in, I start trying to play with a guillotine and my partner will take her hands in defensively and she'll start trying to put a thumb inside and she'll stop me from going in and putting a guillotine in place and she'll put her primary defensive hand in here like so. So if I go in for a guillotine, I feel like it's not there, I start shooting this hand through and now from here we can go in for a D'Arce. Now as my partner goes to pull the arm back, now it's going to be difficult to lock my hands into D'Arce, but I can drag my hands back through and I can go in and start locking high up with guillotines and now my hands can connect to my partner's far shoulder right in front of the front delta right here. So I play this dilemma game between going in for guillotine and going in for D'Arce. Usually my opening game will be to threaten D'Arce like so. The second you go in for a D'Arce, you know your partner is going to be looking to pull the elbow back towards the head and as they do that, they pull you into a guillotine. Or you can do either or first. You can drape the head first, you try to start locking guillotine, they take the underhook out, they start defending and as they put defensive hands in place, you shoot this hand through and you go in and you start locking and now you play the D'Arce game. She defends, now you play the guillotine game. So you can play guillotine D'Arce dilemma, not really half guard passing, but you're doing it from half guard and you can play this dilemma together between D'Arce guillotine and then the trilemma of flattening your partner out if they so choose to move out and away from you and put their back on the floor. So playing the D'Arce, guillotine and chest to chest trilemma. All right, so now we're going to look at someone who tries to come up towards us with his underhook and start moving to their knees. Now there's two ways that a partner can look to start building to their knees. They can do it in a more explosive way where they kind of just get to a tight waist and they try to heist out of the half guard where from here they just physically pull their leg out and they try to go in or they can use a lower leg shifting method, which we'll look at in a little while, but from here they physically take the knee to the inside hip and now they control their partner's leg as they go into a scissoring of the legs and a heist up and go into a tight waist or single leg or whatever the case is. So what we're going to look at is a situation where my partner is down with an underhook and from here she goes to start heisting up towards me. Now the first thing we're going to look at is one where she just tries to pull the leg out. So as I see my partner going to start heisting, you can always tell because she's trying to extract the leg and her hips are rising off the floor. Whenever I see this, I first put a V grip in place like so and I start creating that angle that we like so much. Now as I see my partner go to heist, I take my hand and I quickly pose to my partner's hip. Now I can't leave my hand on my partner's hip for any amount of time. I have to stay with either a V grip like so or a whizzer for my partner not to eventually bump my hand forward and expose my back. But I can go from a whizzer or a V grip quickly to the hip. So as my partner goes to open the knees and start building up, I just take my knee and I just put it on my partner's far hip like so. So now as my partner goes to start moving up and getting to her knees, I just put weight over the far hip. So as she goes to start scooting away and heisting, it's not an easy thing from here. I actually saw this, a similar situation to this in the Jacob Couch match when he went to go heist up off the initial wrestling takedown and I ended up flattening him out and then going into passes from there where I dominated the far hip as he went to go heist. So a couple of options that we have from here is once I go with my knee to my partner's far hip, now I can take the whizzer out because now my partner has no ability to actually expose my back from here. If my knee is trapped between my partner's legs or on the bottom hip, my partner can start to use the underhook to scoot to my back. But from here, when I post my hands on the floor, she goes to scoot towards my back, she can't do it because her hips are controlled through this knee wedge. So a couple of great options I have from here is from here I post my hand on the floor and as my partner goes to start moving out and up like so, I just palm my foot outside of my partner's legs. Because of the fact that her legs are naturally coming apart, her knees are opening, she's trying to pull that bottom leg free, we just put our hands on the floor, we palm our leg through to a neon belly position, where now from here when she goes to start heisting, I can just go in and start flattening my partner out. So I can just palm my leg through and I can move immediately to a neon belly and look to beat my partner as she goes to heist, we can flatten my partner out. Another thing we can do is from here we attempt to pummel the neon belly like so, where my partner for whatever reason tries to start taking a hand down to my leg, moving my knee out of position, then she goes with the single legs and starts to off balance me from here. So whenever I see my partner either create so much of an angle where she uses the underhook to walk down in this direction, like so and starts to scoot around me, and from here it's hard to follow the hip, she has to move so fast and maybe I'm a little bit late, I feel like I'm going to get beat from here, or she physically tries to move my leg out of the way, whenever I see this we just move into a shin pin, where I move from an initial neon belly and now I have control over my partner's hips but her legs are free to move. Whenever I see her going to scoot I just take my knee and I point it between my partner's legs and now from here we just drop our knee right down like so and now we have a butterfly hook above our partner's knee. Now my partner goes to scoot out and start moving around, the bottom leg is pinned now, and now from here we can go in, we can start playing a game where we go through, we use either a cross face or a near side underhook, we flatten our partner out and we can start working from there. So I play this game where I go neon belly first, if I feel like I have to negate my partner's movement more, then we move to a shin pin, where from here we can flatten our partner out, we can go into near side underhook passes, we can flatten our partner out, we can go into cross faces, and now we can play that same game we looked at, I believe, when we went for body lock passing, where from here we can go inside elbow, we'll take our knee across, or we can just go in and start blocking our partner's hips and start walking around to side control, north-south, and go into top pins like that because of the fact that my partner doesn't have control over my ankle, I have my knee trapped almost like a pseudo half guard, my knee is between my partner's legs controlling her legs, but she has no real control of my ankle and no real way to attack me and use half guard effectively. So we look at neon belly, where she goes to start scooting, I post my partner's hip, the reason I post my partner's hip is so I can quickly free my knee, maybe it's not all the way out yet, but I just post on the hip, I free my knee, and I take my knee to my partner's hip. Now we try to initially palm on neon belly, we feel like it's failing for whatever reason, we just take our knee and we can lay it between our partner's knees and legs like so. And now from here we can easily go in, go up to the governor's knee, side under hook, cross face, whatever the case is, flattening our partner out, and that's a pretty easy thing to start going in and working to get into passes from here. Another great option that we have is the second we dominate the far hip, we can immediately start sliding our knee across and forcing our partner into a three-quarter mount where she has to fall all the way to the opposite side and trap my ankle to avoid getting passed into mount. So whenever I see, I'm in this situation like so, from here I just quickly scurry towards my partner's legs. Then as she goes to build up, I just put pressure, pressure, pressure towards my partner's far hip, and I physically pin her hip down towards the floor. So now as she goes to move, I pin the hip, if she doesn't react by turning away from me, I just slide the leg over and I move right into a mounted position, which just can happen sometimes, but more than likely what's going to happen is as she feels the ankle go to escape, she'll turn in the opposite direction from hip to hip, and now from here I'll sit back into my partner's legs in a three-quarter mount and look to start going in and passing. So I play a game where I threaten mount on the opposite side, if she continues to scoot up from here and try to get up, we just flip the leg over and end up mounted on our partner. So what everyone does is as they feel the ankle coming free, they fall to the opposite side, we backstep through, and now from here we go in and cover our partner's legs. And last but not least, we have the overback and chest to chest dilemma, where we dominate our partner's far hip with this knee position, and now right from here, my partner realizes that for whatever reason, she's not happy with this, she doesn't want my knee on the hip. So what she does is the second I go knee to hip, she immediately takes the underhook and she addresses my knee position. Where instead of using the underhook, she goes to push my knee down. Now she has to push my knee down, we use that time to just go into an overback grip from here, and now from here we go in and we flatten our partner out. We switch to an overback grip, or as my partner goes to start pushing my knee down, we go to switch to an overback, and from here she goes to flatten out, and then we switch to that cross face, and we go in and start flattening our partner out with the cross face over chest to chest. And of course, if at any point you can expose an underhook, which you usually can, we're working with the same dilemma of threatening a three-quarter mount and going into an underhook and a cross face and getting a top head and arm. The same dilemma, go back down, to your back. The same dilemma we talked about, where if I'm trying to punch an underhook in, I take an inside elbow or post my partner's leg, I threaten a three-quarter mount, she goes to post to my leg and I punch an underhook in, same dilemma here. This time just from a slightly different position. But from here, I go in, I try to slide a three-quarter mount, or my knee just on my partner's hip, whatever the case is, she freaks out and she's like, I don't want that there. She takes her hand and puts it on my knee. Now from here, we just go in, I allow her to push me back into half guard, but now instead of her having an underhook and going into attacks, now I get my top head and arm, I'm chest to chest and I can start passing. So a multitude of different ways we can go from there, all by dominating my partner's far hip as I go to initially heist up. So she has an underhook, she goes to start building up, and my whole thing is as she goes to start heisting, I keep her down, I just dominate in that far hip. And now from here, when she goes to move, she feels like she can't. But most people, what they'll do is they'll start taking a hand and start posting on my knee. I allow her to push me back into half guard, I backtrack into my partner's legs. So I'm most of the way past, my knee's free from half guard, but I purposely put myself in a backtracking position back into her guard to control her further, but it's on my terms where we can go in and start getting chest to chest and passing with a top head and arm. Okay? So a variety of different options we have. My partner starts to build up to her knees, just quickly freeing our knee, dominating the far hip. And we have all this options we just looked at to start either flattening our partner out or passing right away. All right, so this time, my partner goes in to an underhook, tries to build up to her knees, we return to the floor with a three quarter Nelson, and then we can go into any of the series that we looked at. Usually a lot of times when you flatten someone out with this chin to chest motion, you can go three quarter Nelson right into dark strangles, but we'll look at some of the options we have here. So this time, my partner takes the underhook up high, and she tries to get her head underneath my chin like so. The second I see this, she goes to start building up, we're just going to take a hand to my partner's head like so, and we just go in and we lock hand to hand or wrist to wrist like so, where we take our hand up and over, we grab our own wrist, and we go in with our wrist right over on top of our own wrist. And now from here, she goes to start building up like so, it's a difficult thing. After she gets to her knees, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start taking her chin to her chest and forcing an action where her chin moves down to her chest and towards the near shoulder. This will force her into a front roll. So as she goes to start taking my back, I go into single legs, whatever the case is, we just roll the wrist forward and start bowing our head, and we return her back down to the floor like so. And if she builds all the way to her knees, it's a pretty easy thing to start passing into north south right from here. But more than likely what will happen is she has to start building up. From here I go into that three quarter Nelson, come back to seven. I go to start building, I start inserting that three quarter Nelson. From here she goes to start heisting, and as she goes to heist, she feels it coming into place. She knows if she gets up, she'll be rolled through. So as I start putting pressure on and tension running through the arms, she falls back down to a half guard and locks the half guard. And we end up in a situation like so. Where now from here we can make a transition to a darse. You just move in, we keep the hand behind the head, we switch that ten finger grip, we move to darse. Or of course we go in, we start moving to our over back grips, we start playing a game with our over back grip, or if our partner moves away, flatten your partner out and go chest to chest. So when my partner goes to initially start building up, I know she's going to be playing a heisting game up to her knees, we just duck her shoulder, we put a hand on. Now from here we go in, we get to the crown of our partner's head at the long end of the lever, and we just take our wrist to our own wrist. Now as she goes to start building up, we just take the chin down and make it hard for her to build up to top position. And now we can go into a variety of different attacks from here. Provided she does get all the way up, it's a pretty easy thing to start putting her back down to the floor. When she goes to start attacking me from here, her head has to rise. She wants to run to the other side, her head has to rise. If she wants to start going into single leg, she's moving her head down, gets to the leg, and now from here she has to start shelving the legs, pulling the leg up like so, and the head has to rise, the head has to move. So from here, we play a game where we bury the head. Then when she goes to move the head, she goes to bring the head up, it's a difficult thing, and now it's a pretty easy thing to start bowing, stepping the leg up, and start using that wizard pressure, start taking your partner down to the floor, and put her in the bottom position. So using three quarter Nelson, now my partner goes to build up, sit them back down, either into passing positions or into half guard positions where we're either into an overback submissions or chest to chest. So now this time my partner actually gets up, gets into a situation where it's wizard versus underhook. She's not really in half guard anymore, but this is a transition off half guard, so we're just going to cover it real quickly. She actually gets to an underhook, she builds all the way up to her knees, and we end up in a situation where wizard versus underhook, she pulled the leg out. There's a variety of different things from here I can teach for hours just in this wizard versus underhook position, but the quick defense that we have the second my partner goes to build up is we want to step a leg up and put wizard pressure on our partner. Where from here, we go to wizard our partner down, we put pressure towards our partner's far arm and the head, and now from here we just take a quick sliding action where our right knee comes out like so, and then we look to start going in and facing our partner and going in and getting to a front headlock position. Now normally in wrestling, you don't want anyone to access your legs, so of course you're always going to be here with feet, or knees off the floor. But in our sport, it's a little bit different. A lot of times you want someone going through your legs so that they don't have defensive hands in place and they can't avoid strangles from here. So just be cognizant of the difference in rule change when you're going with someone in wrestling versus someone in our sport. A lot of times in our sport, if I want to geek team someone, I have one primary defensive hand or one attacking hand, one strangle hand, and she has two defensive hands. A primary hand with a thumb inside and a secondary hand that stops me from strangling her. In wrestling, you don't have to deal with this. Your partner's just trying to get to your legs and get to your waist. So for us, a lot of times, when I get to a front head, I'll deny my partner one leg, but I'll give them access to a second. So now she goes to latch onto my leg, she has no defensive hands, and now geeking's come into place where I can go in and start threatening submission. So just understand that when you see jiu-jitsu guys on their knees in front of people, in front of headlocks, don't immediately criticize them because their knees are on the floor. There is a technique and a tactic to this. So when my partner gets up, and we're wrestling versus underhook, they go, and we're playing a game, we're jousting for knee position. I have my left leg up, she usually has her right leg up, and we're jousting for knee and hip position. I'm trying to get my knee in front, she's trying to get her knee in front, and from this position we go in, we get a quick whizzer, we put weight on our partner's hand. From here, we just slide our knee forward and we keep weight over our partner's far hand. So I have my body weight on her, she's carrying my body weight, and I can slow her movement down as far as her reactions go. So from here, we just slide our knee forward, and we start turning an angle like so, we're going to drape our hand over our partner's head like so, and we turn and face our partner. Now we can either go in and keep weight on our partner, and take our knees off the floor. Or from here, we can have her go in and grab my leg, thinking she's going to make a recovery, and then we can go in and start sitting into all of our knee-kicking attacks and other front headlock strangles, kumaras, things like that. Your partner actually builds up to a whizzer versus underhook scenario from the bottom half guard, we knee slide to a front head, and then go into your attacks from front headlock. This time, let's say maybe you're in a submission tournament, or points don't count, whatever the case is, or you just need a submission, you want a submission, or you're training and you want to get a submission, whatever the case is, your partner goes to build up and starts wrestling you, maybe they're a better wrestler, and instead of going into that whizzer versus underhook scenario, where you're confident and you're not going to win, we just roll right into our partner's legs. This is a great way to beat high-level wrestlers with jiu-jitsu in wrestling-type scenarios and scrambles. This time, she's going to be down bottom half guard. She goes to start heisting up. As she goes to start heisting up, she goes in and she makes a mistake of leaving her leg between my two legs. The second I see this, we just step a leg back like so. Our knee goes right next to her knee. Now from here, as our knee goes to her knee, we create an initial whizzer. An initial off balance towards my partner's left shoulder. To put it in a hard whizzer, she goes to base out, and as she goes to base out, we just take our hand free and we just go and we catch both of our partner's legs like so. We go in one, two, and we fold our head underneath our own hips, and now from here, we just hit a quick pendulum. We take our partner forward, we finish in a cross-hashi-gurami, and we go right into attacks on our partner's legs. The second my partner goes to build up, she goes to build up and her leg stays between mine. The second I see a leg between mine, that's when we go in and we start to roll. She goes to build up, the second I see this, we immediately post the hand. As the knee moves back, we whizzer. The second we put that whizzer and our knee's in position, hand comes out, grabs the legs, and now from here, we go in and we start tucking the head underneath us. We have a couple of choices from here. We can go in and we can look over our left shoulder, or from here, we go in, as we look, we go in and we catch. Or we can play a game where we reach back, we catch both our partner's legs, and we look to the inside shoulder, and now from here, we can roll our partner through. So usually, if from here, I'm going to grab both legs first, now it's hard to go over your outside shoulder. If I grab both legs, we go inside shoulder. Or I start to roll outside shoulder, then I make a connection and I get my head underneath my hips, and now from here, we get a quick pendulum. We take our partner forward, we end up in a good cross-hachi-grami, ready to go into all of our follow-ups with leg attacks off of that. Our partner goes to build up from a half guard, thinking she's going to sweep us or take our back, whatever the case is, and we just roll right into the legs and stay in our offensive cycle. All right, so now, we're going to look at our partner who's a little bit more advanced, and this time, before heisting up, they move into a lower leg shifting position. All right, now, what is a lower leg shift? A lower leg shift is a situation where I have my partner's knee trapped in a half guard, like so, and from this position, before we go to heist, we pull our partner's knee through to our inside hip. So from here, she wants to be dominating her inside hip most of the time, where she can go in and pass, but things are different now. I have the upper body inside position, not her. If she had the upper body inside position, with the cross face and underhook, this would be a disaster for me. Because I have the upper body inside position, and now, her knee's in my inside hip, now, I'm in the driver's seat. So from bottom position, she's looking to have knee connected to the bottom hip, like so, the inside hip. She's looking to have knees pinched together, so that my partner now can't take her knee to my outside hip. We saw what happens from here. If my partner is able to take her knee to my far hip and start dominating me, it's not a good thing from here. So instead of just going in, go back in after, instead of just going in and just trying to heist up right away and just pulling the legs out and having my partner just shoot the knee to the far hip, an intelligent person will make a lower leg shift first. Where from here, before they go to do anything, they'll bump their partner forwards with the thigh, perform a lower leg shift, and now from here, they'll go in and they'll either, one, usually start scooping their partner's far leg, or if the far leg sprawls away, now from here, they'll build up to an elbow, they'll start heisting and playing a game, or now from here, they can go in and start going into attacks. So a much better, more intelligent way to start heisting from bottom position is by using a lower leg shift. This usually gives you access to a scoop grip, and even if you can't get to a scoop grip, it gives you much more control over your partner's leg through the whole heist up to your knees, but your partner now can't dominate the far hip and start to go to all their counterattacks. If you go against anybody good and you got to just heist up from bottom half guard, like you're taught in Jiu-Jitsu 101, and someone dominates the top hip, you're going to find yourself in a lot of trouble. So a much better way to start building to your knees from bottom half guard is to first perform a lower leg shift, force the knee to the inside hip, and then build at your pace up to your knees and go into attacks from there. So dealing with the lower leg shift from top position is going to be a little bit more tricky than just having a partner who just tries to get up to their knees in any random way. All right, so now my partner makes this lower leg shift, and she's going to be looking to either build up to her knees or to go into a scoop grip. So the danger is that my partner takes a scoop grip and then uses it to start off-balancing me. So the first thing we're going to look at preventing is my partner going into a scoop grip. She's down, she makes this lower leg shift, and she wants to take a scoop grip. The first thing I do whenever I see this is from here we go in, she has her underhooks like so. We go in and look to start stepping a leg up and getting out and away with our forelegs. When she goes to scoop, it's not going to be an easy thing from here. The closer my legs and knees come together, the easier it is for her to start dominating me and rolling me through and off-balancing me. So we play a game where the second we move into this position, we go in and we take the leg away. And now we're going to look to go in and we can start back-stepping right from here. Let's just start first with preventing a scoop grip and peeling it if my partner gets it. So the first thing I want to do is take my leg out and away, and then from here we just have to go defensive reaction and start to work from here. If my partner does scoop my leg, I want to play a game where I look to start sitting back and away like so. So from here I test my partner. If from here I can take my knee to my partner's far hip, I just place my knee here to my partner's far hip like so. So if she tries to build up to her knees from here, I can pin the far hip and make it hard for her to move up to her knees. Even if she goes to rock me from one side to the other, and goes to come up, I take the wizard out. There's no back exposure from here because I can always control my partner's far hip. Once I'm in this position where I control my partner's far hip, now I can take my wizard out. Now I don't have to keep my right hand occupied anymore. So I can use my right hand for base now. I can lean my right hand onto the floor, and from here we can go and we can scoop, or we can catch our partner's knuckle line and peel the scoop grip. And now from this position, we just pop up to our left knee, off of our left knee, and we just start dominating our partner's far hip. Right now we play a game where we either start going in and putting our knee down and back stepping, or from here we can dominate the far hip and start going in and driving across to our partner's far hip and passing the three-quarter mount. So we play a game where she makes a lower leg shift. We prevent this scoop grip by taking the far leg out and away. She goes to scoop, I make it difficult. Now from here, she actually does get to scoop grip, and we're going to start running into some problems from here. The first thing I do is I test my partner's leg position. If I can dominate the far hip right away, I do so. Now I take my wizard out, and we go in, we'll start stripping our partner's scoop grip, and now we go in, we start backing the leg up so she can't get to the scoop grip anymore. I can even pin this hand down, and now we can start to work from here. Now if in the case that I actually can't dominate my partner's far hip, she goes into the scoop grip, I can't dominate my partner's far hip, now what do I do? I feel like my partner does a good job of pinching her knee down to the floor, her left knee's coming down to the floor, and I just can't get my right knee off the ground. What do I do from here? From this position, whenever I see this, I post my head on the floor. What I don't want is to use my hand to try to peel the scoop grip right away. She goes to roll me through, and now I get off balance. I just keep getting off balance every single time. So from here, I create the best angle I can, and I post my head down on the floor like so. So now when she goes to roll me through, she rolls into my base of support with the head position. And now from here, we go in, and we take a grip on our partner's knuckle line. She goes to keep that scoop, it's a difficult thing from here. Now, from this position, I quickly take my hand to my partner's hip. I can't keep it on my partner's hip because she can start to look to off balance me, but the angle is so drastic from here, she can't immediately expose my back. So I post a hand on my partner's hip, and from here, we go in, we dominate the far hip. Now from this position, we start building up. We come up off of our knee like so, and we go in, we peel that scoop grip, and we go to work. This time, I feel like I can't peel my partner's scoop grip, or I can't get to my partner's far hip and dominate the far hip. From here, we have a whizzer in place, and we put our head down on the floor like so. Now from here, we can either one, go in and start to go and dominate our partner's far hip right away, and then build up like so. That's a good option. Or two, we can go with the scoop grip first, or from here, we go in, we peel the scoop grip, and we start walking our leg away like so. But now when she goes to relock the scoop, it's a difficult thing to start pulling me back in. We're going to put our finger deep now, not wrist or elbow deep. And now from here, we start going in, dominating our partner's far hip, and working from there. So if I'm going to go knee first, I pose the head on the floor, she goes to whip up to her knee, she can't do it. She goes to start taking me down and rolling me through, she can't do it. And now from here, we quickly go in, we take our knee up. And for whatever reason, she's pinching the left knee down so tight that I just cannot take my knee up. And from here, I start playing a game where I'm base out, I start stripping the scoop grip like so. I just start walking my leg back as far as I can. Now from here, if she goes to reach towards me, we can put a blocker in. And when she goes to pull me in from here, she can't take her head in. If I'm here and she has long arms and she goes to start pulling herself in, she can take her head forward and she can take her hand backwards and pull my leg in. So I extend my leg and I put a blocker here as a temporary cross face. So she has to pull me in, it's her arm versus my leg. And now from here, we quickly go in, we take two hands to the floor and we just build back up. Can't stay here for long, I build back up and immediately she goes to start coming towards me. I put a wizard in place and now we start going in and working from this position. So it's a pretty tricky position. If your partner does get a scoop grip, we play between trying to peel the scoop grip and getting our knee from the near hip to the far hip, start dominating the far hip and moving from there. And we can do them in whichever order we want. We can address the knee position first, or we can address the scoop grip first. Then we go and either appeal to scoop grip or dominate the far hip next. All right, so by far and away, my favorite option when my partner goes into a lower leg shift to avoid getting the scoop grip altogether. Because once they get the scoop grip, it's a pretty difficult thing to deal with. So now let's take a look at back stepping right away, or either you back step right away, you peel a scoop grip and you back step. And then how we can pass an attack from a situation where we're sitting on top of our partner's hips. So this time, she goes into her lower leg shift. The second she makes a lower leg shift, I'm just going to take two hands to the floor and I'm going to start back stepping. Now I can't just stay with two hands on the floor obviously because my back's exposed. But the second she goes into that lower leg shift, I put two hands on the floor and now I can hit a back step. Now against someone naive who's going to keep their knees close together, I can take a big back step and I can just step right behind my partner like so. I think it's anybody good, and especially now people are cognizant of leg locks. When I do the back step, she opens up the knee, it makes it hard for me to actually back step and trap my partner's leg. So from here, the first thing I do, instead of taking a big giant back step, is I just palm of my shoelaces right behind my partner's hamstring like so. So now, let's rotate. Now when she has to open up her legs to stop me, it's a difficult thing. And now from here, I slide my knee behind the whole time wedging my partner's legs in place and now I can go in and figure four my legs. So a little bit more advanced way than just back stepping is to first take my two hands out and lean forward and I palm. She has to start opening up her knees, but she can't do it. And now from here, we go in, we figure four our legs, and now we have a choice of course of either rolling forward and to attack our partner's legs, gathering a secondary leg and sitting backwards, or going into our passing options from here. Now our passing options and attacking options will be contention upon where my partner's sitting with the upper body. Is she down on the floor with elbows tight? Is she up on an elbow? Or does she like to keep her underhook in, try to go into attacks from here. There's a bunch of different scenarios we can go into, the attacks we can go into depending on where my partner's sitting with her upper body as we go into the back step. Passing options. So now based on everything you've seen previously, you choose one to pass. That was it? I thought you were going to teach a technique. Me for example, I choose this one. I like this one the most. That's not the position we're in. We're back step. Oh, back step? Yeah. So you back step, off the lower leg shift, now how you pass from here. I don't know. Roll through and finish you. Why would I pass? Why would I pass if I can finish? Final passing options. Fine. That's it. That was it. That's it? Yeah. Thank you guys. Fuck it. Try a leg lock. All right. So we're going to do a leg lock. So hopefully you enjoyed that last clip there to break it up a little bit. Dunny's been asking me to teach a move every single clip for this entire instructional. So first was double leg. That just wasn't even part of the instructional in the first place. And now this is the second one where I was passing options and we just did leg lock. So right on par. What? You don't let me talk ever. I gave you a chance. I wasn't even listening. Maybe later, right? Maybe during beat pathway or something. Next video. Okay. All right. So now we're going to look at passing options from a multitude of different upper body positions from my opponent. And then we're going to look at some far wrist and kimura attacks as well. So now this time we're going to go in, we backstep through. And the hardest time to look to start passing my partner is when I backstep and just like, okay, well if I'm up on my elbow or my elbows are out of the way from my body, my partner can get control of my head and look to start passing. All right. A pretty common thing from here is for someone to go in and punch an underhook in and then go in and start passing. So a lot of times what people do is the second they feel the backstep coming in, like, okay, well let me just stop from here and protect my upper body from a guard pass. Because now they go in, they tuck everything in and it's hard to go into a guard pass. So the second I see this, I go in and I start fiddling around with my partner's feet. So I start creating some kind of distraction where I go in and I start either digging for a heel or I start going in and threatening an Achilles. And whatever the case, whatever attack I have, my partner will have no choice now but to come forward and try to fight my hand. If she doesn't, then she's going to get attacked from here. So what I'm going to do is I'll come forward and try to fight the hands. And now as your partner goes to come forward, now the elbows separate from the body. Now I can go in and punch underhooks in. So I go in, I start making it like I'm going to attack my partner's legs. She goes to come forward. And now from here, we go in and punch an underhook in. Or we go in and we lock our hands. This is a great way to create a distraction to get your partner to open herself up. You create danger at the lower body. So as your partner goes to come forward to counter you and hand fight you. And escape, you can come and start moving to the upper body. So when the upper body is not available, you go to the lower body. Then you go from the lower body to the upper body as we always speak about. All right. So this is a great way to go in and start creating that distraction. If your partner doesn't come forward, then you just go in and you start attacking your partner's legs. Or another great option is if your partner doesn't look to start going in and coming up towards you and opening up the elbows. From here, I just take a quick step out and around. And what I can do is I can force my knee back to the inside position. So I sit to an overback grip and I take my knee to my partner's top hip. So now I dominate my partner's far hip. If she stays in this position, there's no reason why I can't just push and kick my leg free. There's no reason why I can't drive across into three quarter now. Your partner now is going to have no choice but to start pushing your knee down and trapping it between her legs. And now you find yourself in the same overback grip that we looked at before. And we can start going into all of our options from here. So if you cannot get your partner to come off the back and come towards you, then you can just move to overback grips. By going from a backstepping position, you can come forward. And as you come forward, I post on the hip, I post my hand. And now from here, we just sit with our knee on our partner's far hip. Like so. And then from here, we just move to an overback grip. And now we're ready to go in and start attacking. We can also just go right to the overback. So I go right to the overback first. I put more of an emphasis on moving to the overback first. And my knee comes up. Or if my knee doesn't come up, and I post my partner's hip, I make space, I put my knee in that far hip, I start moving to go into my passes. She goes to push my knee down to stop me. And now from here, we're into that overback grip that we like so much. And we can start working from there. So if we can't put our partner's...if we can't take our partner's upper body up off the floor coming towards us, we can either go into our partner's legs, or we can switch to an overback grip. You can also pull your partner's legs towards you. You see this a lot. This gives your partner a little bit more space, and there's more danger of them recovering to an open guard. But you can do this. Where from here, I pull my partner's legs towards me. And from here, I put her legs down on the floor, and we switch to a three-quarter mount. I'm not going to say this is wrong to do this. You can do this. The main danger of this is that when you're going to pull your partner out in this direction, you can use a cross shoulder post with this hand. So as you're going to pull the legs down, she pulled the knee in. I can't get chest to chest from here, and now she brings the legs back inside. So I'm not going to say you can't switch your partner's knees, pull them across, and convert to a three-quarter mount. But...you see that? But there is a danger of your partner using a cross shoulder post and bringing limbs back inside. So I'm not going to say you can't go into a back step, pull your partner's legs in this direction, and then put pressure down, getting chest to chest and controlling your partner's upper body. But during that transition, your partner can switch you across shoulder post. Now I'm going to come forward, she brings the knee in, and I fall into my partner's frames and she recovers. So there is that danger, but you can do this move. You see it a lot, and it is an effective move. But against a good cross shoulder post there, it might be an issue. So those are your options when your partner is down in a very defensive posture with elbows inside. This time, your partner comes up to an elbow, and she doesn't have an underhook. She's here, and it's hard for me to get an underhook from this position. Whenever I see this, we can start going in and playing a game where we either one, again, use that over back grip. So I can't get an underhook on her, but she doesn't have an underhook on me. This time we go in and we can sit that same over back grip. Or from here, we just dive over our partner's back like so, and we take our knee to our partner's top hip. And now from here, we play that same game where either threaten slide the three quarter mount or she pushes the knee down and we have that same over back grip. So she sits up and I can't get to an underhook, she doesn't get to an underhook, we sit to that over back grip and we start working from there. We can also play a game where from here, we go in and we just lock our hands like so. We move into a body locking type scenario. Now the problem with this is if I don't have an underhook and I start passing across this side with the body lock, so I'm not really over my, I'm not really tracking my partner's opposite arm. If I start passing in this direction, my partner can use the underhook to off balance me as I go. So if I body lock and I don't have an underhook and I don't have control of my partner's forearm, I generally prefer to start moving across in the opposite direction. So from here, she goes to come up, I go over the arm, but from here, I don't have the ability to start passing in this direction. Whenever I see this, I back my left leg up. This will give my partner space for her leg to move out in this direction. So I body lock my partner like so, from here I back my left knee up and now I just lift my left knee off the floor and I drive my right knee down. We end up chest to chest and half guard on the opposite side now with the underhook in the proper place. And now depending on how your partner pommels your legs, maybe you'll have a situation where you have a double split, where I have my partner's leg split, maybe she'll have a butterfly hook in, maybe from here your butterfly hook slips off and now you're passing half guard with the body lock on the opposite side and the underhook where you can move to stay with the body lock or you can move to a top patted arm and start passing from there. Another great option are from here, I back step like so, she comes up and I feel like I can't get to an underhook. So she has an underhook but I can't get to an underhook. From here whenever I see this we go in and we lock our partner's body. Now from this position I unlock my legs. From here I don't lean forwards and come driving forwards in this direction. If at any point my partner goes to start turning me in that direction, I unlock my hands and I post. I don't want to get taken in that direction because of the fact that my partner will come up with an underhook. So if I lock my hands and my partner off balances me, I just post my hands and I go back in and I restart from here. I don't just keep my hands locked once they're locked. I only keep my hands locked so I can take her in this direction. So from here we lock our hands like so, we back a leg up. As my leg comes up my knee comes off the floor and now I sprawl my right leg back so I can dominate my partner's left hip with my right knee. From here, and now from here best of all, is as my right knee comes down my left leg comes up and now I can have a double split of my partner's legs. This won't always happen though. Sometimes as you go to start falling down your partner will be able to pummel a butterfly hook in. Your partner will be able to clear this butterfly hook and maybe sometimes you'll end up in a butterfly half guard or a regular half guard with a body lock and your partner can start to give you some trouble. But you will be able to always use that body lock to start passing in the double split position but you can use the body lock to force your partner into a half guard on the opposite side, chest to chest and start passing from there. Now this time she's going to be down and this time I actually can go in, she comes up and I get my under hook. So this is preferred from here. She comes up and actually we'll go into her under hook first because we went defensive and defensively I couldn't get under hook. She gets her under hook and now from here she gets her under hook. She keeps the under hook from this position. Whenever I see this she has her own under hook. There's plenty of different attacks we can go into getting to our partner's far wrist, getting to Kimura's from here and starting to go into attacks. If I don't want my partner to put an under hook in place I just simply post on my partner's trap like so and I just push myself away. She has no ability to follow me with the under hook, she goes to keep a strong tight waist under hook. I just push my partner out and away, I move away and now I can pummel my hand back inside and convert to my own under hook or at the bare minimum clear her under hook. So if she puts an under hook in it's because you're allowing her to do it. It's not because she puts an under hook in and I can't clear. I just make space where I start clearing and now I can pummel my hand back to the inside position. Assuming you're allowing her to put an under hook in place we can start playing games where from here we can start going in and taking hands through in this position. So I put a whizzer into place. From this whizzer I look to take my leg out, I walk around and now I have the choice to either sit that same over back grip we just sat to or I have the choice to dip my shoulder down, come through and start locking hands in ten finger grips like so. Where now from here when she goes to start pulling out and away it's a pretty easy thing to start sliding my knee on through and threatening with darces from here. And of course if at any point she goes to pull herself back and away she will allow you to pass because of the fact that your knee is already in the inside hip. So she has to start staying up from there. She either allows you to pass by pulling out and away from you, then she flattens herself out. It's hard to keep control over my leg from here. So she has to flatten herself out and from here I just turn out and away. So I play this game where I threaten a darce, hand comes through I dip a shoulder. Now I step the leg back over like so and I start putting weight over my partner's head. Now we dip the shoulder and we go in, we lock ten finger. From this position I slide my knee out like so. And now from here we play a game where we can either go in and start attempting to go into darce strangles or from here she goes to start pulling out and away I just lean forward towards my partner, my knee comes out and now from here we go in and we start threatening with strangles or going into attacks with top pins. So going into darces is a great option as well. This time once again she's up, she has her underhook. Now we're going to go in and we're going to look to start pummeling back to the inside position and we're going to get our underhook. Whenever I see that she has her underhook, she's going into attacks from here, we can go in, we can go into body locks if we can crush the underhook enough. We can lock our hands, we can do things we've been looking at before. We can go into the darce, we can go to the far wrist which we'll do in a second. But another thing that we can do is we can just quickly peel that underhook in and if she allows me to get back underneath we just pummel our own underhook in like so. And now once we have our own underhook it's a pretty easy thing from here to start going in and passing. From this position a couple things we can do. One is I can take my leg back through and I can just dive to a top head and arm and crash my partner's far shoulder. So we can jump to a top head and arm, put my partner's back on the floor and now once again we dominate that inside knee, that inside hip with our knee and the pass becomes very easy from here. She can't block the top head and arm in the crossface because her elbow is on the floor. She's up on the elbow, she can't use her hand to block the crossface. She can't pummel, she can't beat me in a battle because this arm is occupied. So if I can punch an underhook in from here it's a pretty easy thing to move right to a top head and arm and because she made the lower leg shift I'm dominating the inside hip now with my knee. You can also start moving into positions where instead of going to a top head and arm we just go in and we just take our head to the opposite side. So I punch my underhook in and from here we just dive through, we put our head to this side and now instead of moving to a top head and arm we move to a head block like so and we can start passing from here. We can start going in, we can take our head to the opposite side and from here we can as our head comes through we dive our head in, we go in and we switch to double underhooks and we start passing from double underhooks. You can take your head to the top shoulder and you can go double underhooks. You can go top head and arm or you can just crash the far shoulder and you can go in and you can go to double underhooks and flatten your partner out here. So you can play now with a variety of these different hand positions when you're chest to chest but this time the only difference is because you backstep you're already starting with your knee free. Your knee is already dominating your partner's inside hip. So as I spoke about before, if you can dominate the inside hip and you're chest to chest you're going to pass people very easily. So from here if I can get my underhook this is always best. Where from here she has her underhook, I backstep from this position, we go in, we start making space. She goes to come forward towards me and I just move away from my partner. I'm not bench pressing my partner off me, I'm just posting on her head so she can't follow me and my body moves away from her. Now if I try to put my underhook in and she doesn't allow me to, she takes the elbow in, that's fine. Then we can just go in and we can start pulling that same body lock we looked at before. We get to our partner's far wrist, we can go to the other things we looked at. But if I can get my underhook, now from here it's a pretty easy thing to start going in. I take my leg up and over. We fall to the far shoulder, lock the top head and arm. We fall to a head block, we fall to double unders. And the whole time, the second I pommel this underhook in, she's going to be trying to re-pommel it. So as she goes to re-pommel that hand, I don't want the elbow to come back inside. So the second I punch my underhook in, my head either goes to one shoulder like so, so now she goes to pommel, she loses the battle. Or if I feel like I'm trying to go to the far shoulder and she goes to take her hand to the inside, I beat her and I go to the near shoulder. So the choice is yours as far as which shoulder you want to go to, assuming your partner doesn't try to pommel the hand inside. If your partner tries to pommel the hand inside, then it's a race to the shoulder. If she can get her hand inside before you can cover the shoulder, she's going to beat you. If you can get your head to the shoulder before she gets her hands inside, you're going to beat her. And if you try to get to the far shoulder, because I'm passing to this side, this is the far shoulder. If I'm trying to get to the far shoulder and I feel like I'm late and my partner's bringing the hand inside, go to the near shoulder. So I pommel an underhook in, she goes to start pommeling, I feel like I can't get to the near shoulder. So from here, go back. I'm losing the pommeling battle, go ahead. We just go to the near shoulder and then we start passing right from here so we don't lose the position completely and we keep the underhook. So the choice is yours as far as where you're going to pass. But if your partner starts pommeling this hand aggressively, you punch an underhook in, she goes to re-pommel, which in most cases this will happen, then it's about racing to the shoulder. If you go to the far shoulder and your partner pommels inside, then you have to go to the near shoulder midway through in order to beat her. So it's going to be this hand versus head pommeling battle you're going to have from here. So we looked at her being down with elbows inside. We looked at her being up with a tight elbow. We looked at her being up with her underhook and looked at the best of all, me, her being up with my underhook. Now let's look at some attacks we can get onto where we start going into getting to the far wrist and flattening our partner out. And then we'll go into a full Kimura sequence in the next clip after this one. When I backstep, understand my partner's far wrist is always available to grab. So when I go in and I backstep from this position, if I can get to this far wrist, I can start draining a load of problems for my partner from here. From this position, I can use the same method that I used when I went into the body lock by stepping my leg backwards and taking my partner to the opposite side. Only this time I'll have a hand trapped on the far side and half guard instead of a body lock. So from here I step my left leg back, I start extending my right leg and from here my right knee comes across and from here we fall across. She switches sides and we flatten our partner out and we get to this far wrist like so. And now when she has to free this far wrist, it's difficult. So I have the same luxury now of using an underhook because my partner's far arm is trapped. She can't use this as an underhook. She can't off balance me with this, but I have the free hand now. So I have a cross face, I have the same wedging as an underhook would have, but when she goes to move that hand she can't. And now from here I can use this free hand now to start going in and separating my partner's legs and bringing my knee on through. So from here we get to this far wrist. Right from this position we immediately control our partner's far wrist. If we can't get to it, that's too far away, I'm trying to reach, I just grab my partner's hand and I drag it on in. Now from here we can play a game where we immediately go to open up the knee or we can first put our partner on her shoulder. Both are good options. Now from here we just sprawl the legs back, we open up the knee. She goes to switch hips and from here we end up in a situation where I control my partner's far arm. And now we can go into a double split, she can have a butterfly hook or she can lock a half guard. However you end up pommeling your leg from here, it'll be a fight in the pommeling battle, but we end up in half guard on the opposite side in a situation where now from here we can control our partner's far wrist. And notice we can do this where we go over our partner's shoulder and get to the far wrist. We can also do this from an underhook type scenario. Notice the first time I did it, it was from over my partner's shoulder. We're going to flatten our partner out and we can do it from under our partner's armpit where we get to an underhook. Both are very good options. So we're in this back step here, we're sitting on our partner's hips, we come through, we get to this wrist like so. From this position, this time we're under our partner's arm, we can also go over our partner's arm like so. Now you have a choice of either one, just jumping across, where as your partner goes to switch hips, you end up in a situation like so. And now from here we can either pull the arm in or as she goes to extend it, we switch to an underhook. But on the other hand, you put your partner's shoulder on the floor first, now she won't be able to extend it. Where now from here my legs come back, knee comes through, she goes to extend the arm from here, she can't do it. Now we land in half guard and we make a good conversion to a chest to chest position now on the opposite side. So in general, if you're looking to use this far wrist grab, if you hop across to the opposite side and your partner's elbow's on the floor and the shoulder's still off the ground, your partner will most likely be able to extend the arm and you can switch to underhook and cross face. If you want to stay with the wrist, and you may be comfortable staying with the wrist, you may be comfortable, more comfortable moving to a top head and arm. If you want to stay on the wrist, put the shoulder on the ground first. That's passing in this direction. So if I want to stay on my partner's wrist, I first put the shoulder on the ground here. Now from here, when she tries to extend her arm away, there's weight over the arm. So when I go to take her to the opposite hip, she can't extend the arm. If however, I go into this pommel and the shoulder's off the floor, maybe it's hard to break my partner down, whatever the case is, it's hard to move my partner around, I can just jump to this opposite side, I extend, I walk everything back, I extend like so, we got to move across. This time, because my partner's shoulder's not on the floor, she has to extend the arm as we go through. If she goes to free that arm, we switch to an underhook instead. And whether we're under the arm, if we're under the arm, we end up with double underhooks. And if we're over the arm, we end up with a top head and arm, we can now go into passing. So in general, if my partner has the shoulder off the floor, we're going to convert to an underhook as we take her across. And if my partner has shoulder on the floor, we'll stay with the far wrist. And the choice is yours on whether, where you want to go to. And of course, you always have the choice of letting your partner extend the arm, even if they can't, you can let go. And as they extend, switch to a top head and arm or double underhooks as you transition to the opposite side. Okay. That's taking your partner across to the opposite side as we did when we went into a body lock. We can also pass to the near side. Where from here, we go in, and this time, once I get to the wrist, I'm going to pass to this side. The first thing I want to do is take my partner's shoulder to the floor. What I don't want to do is step in this direction. Now she's in an athletic stance up on her elbow, and so you can start pulling herself up and exposing my back. So from here, going over the arm like so, we put the shoulder on the floor first. Now, the second I come out into this position, I immediately step, I turn, and I dominate the far hip. When she goes to move from here, there's just nowhere she can go. Now that I dominate the far hip. And now I have a multitude of passing options. You can go in, you can insert butterfly hooks, free the leg. You can start stepping across and mount. There's triangle options here. You can do so many different attacks once you have this far wrist pinned. You can pass in this direction as well, but if you go over the arm, it's very, very important that right in the beginning, you get to the far hip with your knee and you dominate that far hip. If I go in over the shoulder and I pass, I first go in, I immediately put the shoulder down right from here. Now I come through, my knee plants, as my right knee rises, we dominate the far hip. She goes to start building up and moving around from here, there's just nowhere to go. And now from this position, it's a pretty easy thing to start pummeling my feet through and start going into attacks, whether it be taking my partner to side control, whether it be mounting, whether it be starting to go in with various upper body grips and taking my partner's back. There's a ton of different things that we can do from here that branches off from attacking or passing half guard. In addition, last but not least, we go into an underhook, we start passing in this side. Because we have an underhook this time, it's not so, so crucial that we dominate the far hip because of the underhook, there's no back exposure. So this time, we get to an underhook, we control that far wrist here, we feel like we can't get to it, whatever the case is, we go in and grab the hand, we pull the wrist towards us, we put the shoulder down on the floor. Now we go in and we step into this position. When she goes to start building up from here, exposing my back, she can't because of the fact that from here, there's no back exposure due to my underhook. And now we can play a game where we can either flip to start freeing our leg, where she goes to start moving around, I take my head down right next, close to hers, and it's difficult. If she takes the hand through, all the way through to this position, now when my legs do come free, there's a back kick. So normally what I like to do from here is I play a game. If I want to pin my partner, I cover my partner's far shoulder here. So now when she goes to pull the hand out, it's physically impossible. If I want to bait my partner into creating back exposure, I just put my head here next to hers. So now she fights to bring the hand through, the hand comes through, now when she has to bring it back, it's not easy. And now from here, once I free myself from inside my partner's legs, the hand's right there available to switch to claw grips, and now I can hop across and create back exposure on my partner. If the hand is trapped, and now I have control over my partner's far shoulder with my head, when she has to start turning towards me and avoiding the pin, the pin is a very easy thing from here. So I play this game based around what I want to do. If I want to make sure that I pin my partner, I block the hand from coming around by controlling the far shoulder. If I want to bait my partner, and I don't care where the hand goes, it can come in front, I put it right here by the head. Now she goes to come in front, it's a pretty easy thing now to start going in, taking claw grips, and creating back exposure. In addition to this, you always have the choice, once you flatten your partner out, of just immediately taking your knee to that top pin. So now when she goes to go anywhere, she's really screwed, and it's a pretty easy thing now for me to start going in and playing a game where I can start flattening my partner out, bringing my leg, and going into passes, back kicks, and dollop attacks from there. So I know this is a long clip, but these are all of the passing options that you have from this back stepping position. You have to look first at your partner's upper body position when they back step. Are they extended towards you, are they coming towards you, or are they very defensive down on their back? If they're very defensive down on their back, there's a couple things you can do. In general, you usually just either threaten rolling into their legs to get them to come forward and open up, or you actually go into leg attacks. As they come forward towards you to open up, then you can start punching in underhooks, you can start punching in top head and arm. Because of the fact that you're back step, if you get to a top head and arm, or double underhooks, or a head block, your knee is already dominating the inside hip, and it makes passing extremely easy from there. If you feel like passing to the near side isn't an option, then from there, we just take everything across back to the far side, and we start passing on the opposite side, half guard, chest to chest, and then going in from there. Then of course, if you can get to the far wrist and flatten your partner out, there's so many different passing options from one side to the other that you can use, and going right into submissions with that far wrist control. Then obviously, if you're looking to punch people, they're relevant here, but if you're looking to punch people, it makes a big difference. In general, when you're using the far wrist, if you're looking to take your partner across to the opposite side and pass in half guard, if you want to switch to a top head and arm, you just hop across, and you make a conversion as they extend the arm to a top head and arm, or double underhooks. If you want to make sure that you keep the far wrist, if you're a big fan of getting to that far wrist, you put the shoulder on the floor first, so that as you go to move out and over to the opposite side, it makes it hard for your partner to extend the arm because there's weight over the arm, and you can stay with the far wrist, and then you can pass from there, or make a conversion to an underhook. A lot of stuff there, but it's super important, and those are your passing options once you backstep and prevent the scoop grip from the lower leg shift. So now we're going to go into attacks with Kimura, and we're not particularly going into guard passes. Maybe we're falling into T-Kimura, maybe you are passing your partner's guard. Maybe we're falling into T-Kimura or going into other forms of attack with this Kimura grip. Also, before I go into this clip, I started teaching that last clip with passing options, and just so you guys know, halfway through, I realized that there were way more passing options than I remembered when I was planning the instructional, and then we ended up doing a half hour clip, so I'm sorry for just doing a half hour clip, but I'm sure if you guys need to rewind it, you can go rewind it. I probably should have broken it down into a few different sections, like passing versus an overly defensive opponent, standard upper body grip passing with top head and arm and double unders, and then probably with the body lock and far wrist passing and Darcy Kimura. But I just didn't do that because I just forgot that there were that many passing options, and then we just ended up doing a half hour clip, so I'm sorry about doing a long clip like that. We finished it, and she was like, Jesus, what are you on, cocaine or something? And I'm like, I don't know, there was more passing options than I thought from there, and Randy's like, yeah, it was a half hour long, and I was like, yeah, that probably was a little bit much, but I'm not reshooting that half hour clip because all the information is there. So I know it was a fast and a lot of information, so just rewind it and pause it if you have to, because that was definitely my bad, but nonetheless, all the information is there. Now let's look at attacking with Kimura from this position where we can back step on our partner's legs and stop them from coming up. So when I back step on my partner here, now instead of everything we looked at before with it, even with the attacks with Darcy's and everything, we looked at ways to actually pass my partner's guard. With Kimura, so she has an under hook, she sits up from here, and here we're going to go through, we're going to back step on our partner like so, and we're going to go in and we're going to start to move into a situation where I can lock Kimura. If you guys want to look at a match where I use this initial Kimura to start going into attacks, a great match is my match against Yuri Samoa at the side, it's on Flow, if you guys want to watch it. So from here, we go in and we look to start getting to my partner's far wrist. So I go in and I get to my partner's far wrist, I take my head over my partner's far elbow like so. And now from here, we just go in and we lock Kimura. If you try to do it out here somewhere, you'll never have arms long enough to actually reach Kimura. So I make sure I take my chin and I place it here over my partner's far elbow like so. And now from here, we go in and we start locking into Kimura. Now from this position, we're just going to go in and we're going to unlock our legs and we're just going to hop across into a Ki-Kimura position. Or from here, we just place an elbow down on the floor. And from here, we just dive into this Ki-Kimura position like so. And now from here, we're ready to go in and look to start to attack. And obviously, if my partner turns towards me and tries to come up on top, I get my partner's back. If my partner stays here, that's a pretty easy thing. So I'm scissoring my legs. And from here, we come up into a situation where we can go in and lock Kimura and get a top pin position and go in for the win. So we go in, we lock initial Kimura. And just because we start with Kimura doesn't mean we have to finish with a Ti-Kimura. We can go in, we can get to an initial Kimura. And from here, if we feel like maybe we don't want to jump to Ti-Kimura or whatever the case is, we can always convert to a wrist and put our partner's elbow or partner's shoulder on the floor. You don't have to go to Kimura. We can also go from that wrist. And then we can go in and we can lock Kimura later. Where now from here, we come in, we have Kimura grip and we just jump across up towards my partner's shoulder line into Ti-Kimura like so. If your partner's head slides out, you're in Ti-Kimura. If your partner's head stays in, you're in a backhand arm. And now from here, you can start going in and either attacking strangles, you can start building up, start taking your partner's back. There's plenty of different things you can do from here. We use this Ti-Kimura and start going in and start attacking with attacks in Kimura or back attacks or passes from there. We can also use this Kimura to go in and right from here, we can immediately, once we have this Kimura locked, we can immediately step through and we can start dominating our partner's far head from here. For now, because of the Kimura, even when she goes to use the underhook and come up towards me, it's a difficult thing because I'm dominating the far head. And now from here, we can play a game where I either put my partner's shoulder on the floor or because I have the Kimura grip now, I can always start to hop across to that far shoulder. Even if the underhook's in place, I just hop across to my partner's far shoulder. And from here, I have that Ti-Kimura in place. I'm ready to go in and start attacking our partner from here. All right, so we can play a game where we can pass now and start attacking from either side. I can jump right to a Ti-Kimura, which if I have the Kimura, it's usually a good option from there. But because you have the Kimura grip, you can also start to pass to the near side, dominate your partner's far head, and then jump to Ti-Kimura and threaten passing to one side and hop across to the other side. So we have versatility now with the Kimura grip moving around your partner's body and going either into submissions or getting your pins or back picks. All right, so now we've looked at getting our knee to our partner's far head. We looked at backstepping. Now let's look at a combination and dilemma between these two. Understand that when your partner goes into this lower leg shift, she's going to be trying to keep your knee connected to her inside hip by closing the top knee down to the floor. So from here, I got to open up my knee. It's a hard thing to do. So if I want to go into a backstep, it's a pretty easy thing to do. But a lot of times, the second I go to start going into a backstep, my partner immediately opens up the knee so that I can't even pommel my shoelaces behind. So I try to pommel my shoelaces behind, and the second she feels my weight transfer from my left knee to my right knee, she opens up her knees. Now I can't even pommel my hook in. Whenever I see this, I use a threat of a backstep, where as I go to start backstepping or pommeling my leg through, maybe I make it a big exaggerated backstep so my partner has to open up the knee nice and wide. Whenever I see this, I immediately take my knee from the inside hip to the outside hip, get a near hip to the far hip. Because of the fact that my partner now is opening up her knees, I can now move my knee freely. If her knees are pinched together, I can't move my knee around. So I fake a big backstep, I just lean my weight, and I go to backstep. I don't take my leg so far off the ground where now it will take time for me to replace my leg down and then transfer the weight. I just lean my weight like I'm going to backstep, like so. And now from here, I just take my left knee in, and I take my right knee up to my partner's far hip, and I start dominating that far hip. And now from here we go into the same series that we looked at before. So I play a dilemma game where I distract my partner, and I play with one or the other. Where from here, we go in, and we try to go to a backstep. My partner opens up the knee. The second I see this, we switch knees and we dominate the far hip. Or we can do it in the reverse order. This time, I'm trying to dominate my partner's far hip, but she keeps the top knee closed. Where I'm trying to get my knee out and try to move around, and from here I feel like I can't move my leg, no problem. We go in, and we go right into a backstep. We play a combination dilemma game between dominating the far hip and threatening a backstep. Alright, so now we can play a game between faking a backstep and as my partner opens up the knees, knee sliding through into front headlock scenarios. This time, my partner has an underhook, and she forms a lower leg shift. Now from here, I go in and I start making the backstep. If I just try to knee slide right from here, my partner just pinches her leg together and my ankle gets trapped. So from here, I go in, I go to backstep, my partner opens up her knees, and from this position I just take my knee slightly forward. My knee just comes right forward, like so, and as my shoelaces are still caught, I just swish my legs out to the side like so. And now from here, I immediately go in and I cover my partner's head and I start moving in to go into front headlock. Now once I'm in this position, my partner has a couple of choices. She can fall down to her back, I can follow with the guillotine. She can fall down to her back, and I can go and I can start cross-facing and looking to either one, keep my hand here so she can't use the underhook, or if I feel I have the time and the space, I can follow to an inside bicep tied underhook. Or what my partner can do, they try to chase me up and start coming up and trying to turtle and turn towards me and start coming up to her knees to wrestle. Whenever I see this, I just immediately dominate that far head. So now she has a turtle. It's not going to be impossible, but it's not going to be easy. And now from here, this gives us time to work at our own pace and negate our partner's movement. So we play a game where we try to go in and backstep off this lower leg shift. Backstep's not working. As we go to backstep, she opens up her knee. From here, we just slide our knee forward right to our partner's armpit, like so. Now we swish our legs out. If I have my knee on the hip and she goes to open up her knees, I can't swish my leg free if my ankle's still caught on her left leg. So I slide it just by her left leg, and then I swish her out. So from here, I go to backstep, she goes to open up the knees to stop me, and now from here, we're ready to go in, move to front headlock, and play our game from there. All right, and then at any point, if your partner's giving you trouble with one of these, we play a trilemma between all of them. Where from here, I try to dominate the far hip, maybe that fails. I go into a backstep, maybe it fails. As I go into a backstep, she opens up the knee. I try to knee slide forward, but she catches my ankle. And now from here, we go back into a backstep, where we open up the knee. We play a trilemma between knee sliding, backstepping, and dominating our partner's far hip. Where if one doesn't work, open up the leg. If one doesn't work, the other one works. And now from here, we go in and get to our pass, get to our attacks, and finish this from there. All right, so now let's say this time, your partner actually gets the scoop grip, and you feel like, okay, this is not going to be good for me from here. What am I going to look to start doing? I can't hit any of these previous options. So this time, from here, if I should get to a scoop grip, and I feel like, okay, it's going to be hard for me to peel the scoop up. I can't peel the scoop grip. I can't make any of this stuff happen. When I see this, I'm just going to post on my partner's hip like so, and I'm going to look to start attempting to flatten my partner's hip out by just pushing ever so slightly with my right hand, and then taking my knee up. As I'm going to take my knee up, I focus on taking my left leg and just sliding it underneath my partner's head and putting her back and her hips flat on the floor. So I play a game where I just post out on the hand, and from here, I just slide everything forward. My left knee comes forward. I sit into this position here, where now from here, I put my partner flat, and now she has to go into a situation where she has to play deep half guard, and now I can start to go in and either punch in my arm. I can punch in my own underhooks, or she has her underhook still, and I can look to start to attack and play from deep half guard. This time, we feel like our partner has a scoop grip. She's threatening to come up on top of me or roll me through. I feel like, okay, this is not good. Before my partner can look to roll me through, I force her into a deep half guard position. I take my knee into the proper position that I want, which is either on center line or better on my partner's far hip, and then we can use her initial scoop grip with the lower leg shift to force her into deep half guard and then go into our attacks or passes. She takes a scoop grip like so, and I feel like, oh man, this is not going to be good. I take my whizzer. I have it in place. As soon as I take the whizzer out, I post my partner's hip. Now, as she goes to start moving me around, I just force her into a situation where I slide my left knee underneath my partner's head. Now from here, we're in a deep half guard scenario. Even if she doesn't go completely flat, it's okay. Now she has to come up on top of me, she can't get on top. She can only get her rolling through and let's just start piling her legs and move into a deep half guard scenario. Or now I can force my partner into deep half and go into more attacking options, but I feel like the previous options may have just not worked or I'm just more comfortable fighting from deep half than I am lower leg shift and scoop grip. This time, instead of forcing my partner into deep half guard, this time she goes to a lower leg shift and she tries to roll me through. As my partner goes through this lower leg shift, she gets a scoop grip and tries to actually roll me through, we're going to make a conversion to deep half guard on her roll. The previous step, this previous move, we went into a deep half guard proactively where we forced our partner proactively into a deep half guard. This time we're going to do it reactively when she goes to roll through by just sitting back to one hip and taking my knee to the far hip. This time, the big problem from here is my partner has this lower leg shift and she goes to roll me through. If she goes to roll me through in one direction, I post the hand, she can come back in the opposite direction and if my knee is on the near hip, the inside hip, she just goes in and exposes my back. So from here, this time she goes to roll me through. As she goes to roll me through, I take a hand and I post it out here somewhere. So I take my left hand and I post in the direction she wants to take me. As she does that, this will slow the roll down. So she goes to start rolling me through, I post the hand. The second this happens, I'm looking to shelf my partner's head on my leg, I'm looking to take my knee to at least center line and preferably to my partner's far hip. So she goes to roll me through, we just shoot our knee underneath our partner's head like so. So now from here we have a base of support, we have our knee on our partner's hip and now even without the wizard, if she goes to whip back up, you can't because my knee dominates the far hip now. And now from here we can start working in this position where we can get into all of our attacks. For my partner, keep your head off the floor so I don't knee you in the head this time. My partner comes into this lower leg shift, this time she goes to shoot into the deep half guard. Now if I just go to post on my partner's hip, she just rolls me through because there's no base of support. So the first thing I do is I take my left hand and I move it out. I feel if she goes to roll me through, I create an angle like so. Now as she goes to roll me through, I just shoot my left leg forward like so and we end up in this deep half guard position. Now she goes to whip back up in the opposite direction and my knee dominates the far hip because she can't actually get up and come to chase my back or those single legs in wrestling exchanges. So this time it's a reactive thing. So my partner scoops the leg, goes to shoot into deep half with a scoop grip or take me over and then from there I force her into a deep half position where she can't play a multi-directional game and whip back up towards me and come to her knees and start wrestling. All right, so now let's take a look at how we can actually escape this position when we initially stop our partner rolling us through. So this time we come in, our partner initially tries to go and roll us through and from here we post like so, we post on the far hip and we get to a situation like so. Now from this position a lot of times what will happen is as your partner goes to come back up, they won't use an underhook, they'll take a grip here on your leg. So as they go to whip back up, they end up in a situation like so where now from here you have to reinsert the wizard. When your partner moves back to this position, understand now this is the game you're playing. Now I go in and again I look to start going in, posting my head, clearing the scoop grip and then playing from here. Or I look to start going in and dominating the far hip and playing from here. Whenever I see my partner tries to roll me through and it fails, be ready for a good person to use a hand assist, a good person will use a hand assist to put the knee back on the inside hip like so and now as she goes to whip up, I have to put a wizard back in place. Now as my wizard goes back in place, now we're just in the same game where we're trying to go in and peel the scoop grip, I'm posting my head on the floor, stripping the scoop, then beating her from here. Or if I can't do that, going in and dominating the far hip. Whenever I see my partner tries to take me over the far side, if it fails, she whips back in the same direction, now we're back into the same initial game that we were playing where she initially gets the scoop and we're trying to just peel that scoop grip off of our leg or dominate our partner's far hip. Now we come full circle where our partner goes in one direction, tries to come back in the opposite direction and we're back to square one where our partner initially got the scoop and we can start the fight from there. And of course, if at any point my partner now goes to start building up to her knees by taking her scoop out, the lower leg shift, she goes to start coming out, we can go into all of our three-quarter Nelson game. If my partner comes up, we can go into a situation where we roll into our partner's legs, we can go into every series, the whole series that we looked at, if our partner actually does come up towards us. Now we have kind of a full series here where our partner uses a lower leg shift, tries to roll us through. If it fails, we can force the path guard. If our partner whips back up, we peel the scoop grip, we dominate the far hip. We have kind of options now for wherever our partner goes, whether it's coming towards us and building up to her knees or trying to roll us through to the far side and sweep with the lower leg shift. All right, so now everything we've done so far has been based around my partner using an underhook and having a traditional lock of the legs and half guard. But now my partner gets a butterfly hook from this underhook position, which is a butterfly half guard with an underhook. We have to look to start dealing with my partner from these positions here. So she sits up to a power prop on her elbow, and now she has an underhook like so. Before I see this, the first thing I want to do is I can't start driving towards my partner. At any point I drive towards my partner, she just starts elevating me and getting her far leg behind my hamstring. It makes it hard for me to start sitting back, and then she can elevate me and start entering into my legs. So from here, the second I see this, I immediately sit back towards my heels, and I immediately look to start either putting a V grip or at the very least a whizzer into place and start creating this angle like so. Now the second I see this, we just go in and we sit to this over back grip here. Now from this position, we make sure that when we go to flatten our partner out, we have that proper leg position. What I can't do is just randomly drive towards my partner's far shoulder. She goes to go with me and elevate me left shoulder, and then from here, we end up in a situation where we get exposed and go into Hashi Gorom. So when I sit to this over back grip, I want to flatten my partner out. I make sure I do so in a very specific way. I immediately take my left knee to my partner's hip. I scissor my legs and I kick my right leg back as I pinch my two knees together. So as my upper body drives forward, my right leg shoots backwards. When she goes to elevate me left shoulder, she can't do it. And now from this position, we're in the same over back series we looked at before, but from here we can go into Kimuras, we can go into Gichins, we can start going into that knee direction, go up over, either step over or start playing in whatever fashion you want from there. So this time my partner gets to an under hook from the butterfly half guard. She sits up, punches in a butterfly hook, and either starts in a butterfly half or pummels her foot to the inside. We can sit to an over back and use the same over back series that we looked at in the beginning. All right, so a lot of times my partner moves into this under hook and has a butterfly half guard. She won't just try to elevate me over her far shoulder, but try to go into an attempted Tsumugi-shi and go near shoulder and you just start going into inversions or leg entrances or whatever the case is. Okay, so the first thing we're going to look at is my partner goes to start off balancing me from here, goes to start going into a Tsumugi-shi. The first thing we're going to do is immediately take our head and block our partner's far shoulder. Understand that for a Tsumugi-shi, she needs to start hiking the under hook up. As she goes to lift, she has to take this far shoulder down towards the floor towards me. Then from here, she goes to start falling down to her shoulder like so, and now as she goes to lift, she has to raise that far shoulder further and further off the floor and then eventually turn belly down to sweep me and everything starts at that far shoulder. So the second I see my partner goes to hit that Tsumugi-shi, we immediately put a V-grip in place. She gets to the under hook, she wants to start hiking the under hook up. So the second I see my partner start lifting, and you can always tell because there's always tension with your partner's leg and with the lifting action of the under hook. The second I see this, I sit back and I just block my partner's far shoulder. So the second she goes to starting a Tsumugi-shi action, we just move into this position here. And now as she gets started lifting out to her right, I just circle everything out to her left. And now from here, it's a pretty easy thing to make convergence either near side under hook like so, or body lock where we can go in and start flattening our partner and looking to pass with either locked hands or near side under hook, which we're going to look at later. So the second I see my partner starting to lift to my left, I walk to my right. Okay. It all starts at the far shoulder. If I can't block the far shoulder, if I just go to walk and my partner goes to start lifting, you get off balance every time. My whole thing is I sit back and I block the shoulder first, like so. So now when she goes to start lifting, stop the initial lift. If I don't have that, she goes to lift and I get severely off balance. So I block the initial lift by covering the shoulder. Now when she goes to throw me, I just circle out in this direction, like so. I put her belly up. Now when she goes to move me around, it's a pretty easy thing to go in, start locking up and making strong connection to my partner, going in and flattening her out chest to chest. Okay. So the first thing I do is I block that far shoulder. Okay. Now, assuming I can't block the far shoulder, my partner goes into the sumigeshi, we're going to go to that same hip switching action that we looked at before. Because of the fact that my partner has a butterfly hook and is extending the butterfly hook toward me, it makes a hip switch pretty easy because my partner's extending herself so far. So whenever I see my partner goes into sumigeshi, the first thing I can't allow is for my partner to cover my arm and now I'll put a weight over my arm. Now I'm going to get taken over from here. So the first thing when I see my partner go in and start lifting sumigeshi is I take this hand off the floor. If I'm going to post it anywhere, I don't post it right in front of my partner and allow her to grab it. Okay. So if I'm going to post it anywhere, I let my partner take me a little bit further than I want to do. The instinct is always to base out and to stop your partner from moving you. But if you can block the shoulder, that's a good thing to do. But if she beats the shoulder, let's say the underhook gets punched up too high, she beats the shoulder, don't post the hand here because she'll grab it and then make it a pretty easy thing for her to take me over. So if I feel I'm being off balance, I base my knee out first. So as she goes to off balance me, my knee comes out. Now this gives me an extra half a second to switch either through like so or over to an over back grip. And now as that happens, I take my hand down to my partner's hip. When she goes to fall and catch my hand, she goes to fall to her shoulder. We go to an over back grip. And now as she goes to extend, we just hit that same hip twitch series that we looked at before. And now we can hip switch past our partner's sumigeshi and look to start going into passes to the side control or to north south. Okay. My first thing is to block my partner's far shoulder. She gets an under hook. She goes to off balance me. We block the far shoulder, making it hard for her to go into sumigeshi. This time we go in. I feel like she's going to fall to her shoulder and she's beaten me and I can't control my partner's far shoulder. Whenever I see this, we don't post the hand out and give her access to the hand. We base the knee out first, like so. As we base the knee, the hand comes down to the floor. Now she goes to fall to her shoulder and finish sumigeshi. We sit to the over back grip. As she goes to extend, I follow the extension, the hip switch on bai, and now from here, I'm ready to go in and start pinning our partner, side control, north south, whatever you want from there. Okay. So the first thing is, she goes under hook and puts a butterfly half guard in place. She goes to start lifting me over the near shoulder this time. I block the far shoulder and stop her from coming up. If I miss the far shoulder, as my partner falls to her shoulder, I never let her control my arm. I get to an over back grip, a hip switch past, and we go into our attacks from there. All right. So now, this time, my partner gets to that same under hook from the butterfly half guard, and this time, instead of trying to go sumigeshi or start coming up into attacks, my partner looks to start going into scoop grips and start elevating me into deep half guard, ashi grami type territory. Okay. So whenever I see my partner goes for under hook and then immediately goes into a scoop grip, she goes to start scooping, scooping, scooping, and she goes to start taking me out in this direction, like so. All right. Understand one thing. My partner, in order for her, in order for her to come up to my back in this position, she has to take her leg out. Okay. If she tries to take my back from here, she can't get to my back from this position. She has to take her left leg out. Now she can start coming up, scooting around the corner, start kaisting up, and now she can take my back. Okay. So my partner goes to shoot into a deep half guard type scenario from here, and she has a butterfly hook in place. You no longer have to worry about your partner whipping up and getting directly to your back, provided she has a butterfly hook. Okay. So it's okay for me to post my hands on the floor from here. Normally, she has an outside position with her leg. From here, I have to keep the wizard as she goes to start whipping me through, I'll just start leaning back, and now she goes to whip up and my back's exposed, so I have to keep the wizard in place. With a butterfly hook, I don't really have to worry about that immediately, but if my partner goes to take her leg back to the outside position from the initial butterfly hook, now I go and start reinserting my wizard. So just be cognizant of this. Okay. Now, once my partner actually gets to this situation, where now from here, she has a butterfly hook in place, and she has kind of an X guard type scenario, more than a D path guard type scenario, now she can switch between the two. She can go to D path if she wants to by triangling her legs on the outside or taking her foot to the outside position, or she can stay with the butterfly hook. Both are great options. Whenever I see this, what I don't want is for my partner to start using the butterfly hook to off-balance me by keeping the butterfly hook above my knee. So the second I see my partner switch me into this position, the big danger from here, she goes to forward shift me forwards and immediately starts going into either a leg attack or a heisting game where I lose position completely. All right. So I'm looking to flatten her out in half guard, and now she has all the inside position. So the second I see my partner goes to scoop and shoot into this position here, we just post on our partner's knee. When she goes to keep that butterfly hook locked above my knee, we just slide our knee through so that our knee now is above my partner's butterfly hook. When she goes to extend me down and away, she has no more relevant purchase now on my leg. In order for her to extend me away, she has to be above my knee. Now when she goes to extend me away, she moves me easy. So I always post my partner's knee and I clear my knee above the butterfly hook like so. Now when she goes to move me around, it's not nearly as strong. If at any point she uses her free hand to push my knee down and reinsert the butterfly hook, I post the knee and I clear the butterfly hook. We play this game from here, when wherever she goes to put a butterfly hook back in place, I always clear with the post of my partner's knee. And now from here, when she goes to start moving around, maybe she goes to push my knee down and I go in and I punch her underhook in place. I start lifting and we punch Kimura in place. And now from here, when I have my attacks, now it's much harder for her to start controlling me. When she goes to start forward shifting me, I can start going in and playing a game where I like to start pommeling my leg free and now we can start pommeling through here. Okay. So whenever I see my partner goes to scoop and shoot into an Ashi-Gurami X guard slash D book pass guard type scenario with that scoop grip, I always make sure I never allow my partner to put a butterfly hook in above my knee. I always want my knee free from the butterfly hook. So when she goes to move me around, it's not nearly as powerful. Then we play a basic to 11 game. Whenever my partner goes to post in my knee, to push it back into the proper position, we can go in, start underhooking, start attacking our partner from there with Kimura's underhooks and other attacks from there. Okay. Whenever she goes to shoot in deep, we always focus on a battle of the knee position. She wants her butterfly hook above my knee. I want her butterfly hook below my knee and it makes a big difference. So be disciplined with fighting and making sure that your knee is always in the correct position relative to your partner's butterfly hook.
