 All right, so finished North-South Strangles, now let's go into Back Crucifix with this Garat, a single arm rear naked. Now obviously, I don't think we've covered too much of going to Back Crucifix escapes, and I'm not going to go into the full positional escape, that's not really the idea of this, I'm just going to look at the strangle, but I'll give you guys a few escapes as well. First, just recognizing danger, putting defensive hands in, how to move our jaw when our partner is trying to strangle us, and then working through earlier escapes when the hand is under the jaw but it's not really set completely, and then try and go into late escapes when the hand is all the way behind the back set and your hands are trapped and trying to free the one hand or the other, peel the hand down and then go into your defensive reactions and escapes. Okay, so I'm not going to go into breaking down how to escape the full position in its entirety, but I'm going to look at some escapes and mostly strangle defenses from here. Take it easy, take it easy. No I'm not, it's the end of the day. I'm going to put so hard, I'm going to make this whole DVD sound like a total bullshit. This one is going to be really defensive. We're going to be in crucifix and we're going to look at back crucifix and our partner is looking to go from here into strangles. Most of the time she's going to have control over my right arm in this case, obviously with some kind of leg configuration, and most of the time she's going to have control over this hand usually at the actual hand itself rather than the wrist, and now it's going to be hard for me to go into defensive posture from here. Now in the event that my partner isn't this late into the stages here and she just has maybe a kimura like so, or maybe she has a backhanded arm like so, or she's getting close and she goes to switch or maybe she goes to switch from kimura to backhanded arm and goes to put a strangle in and I catch with my primary hand in place. This is always what I want, I want to have a primary hand in place. Now she's always going to be looking to strip that primary hand obviously and control it and then go in and strangle me, but if I can I want to have this primary hand in place here. Now as my partner goes to start strangling me, she controls the hand, she beats the primary hand, she has my other hand trapped, this is no good from here. From this position I have to play a game where I am moving my head and my jaw around so she can't get underneath. The first thing I do is I look towards my own shoulder and I just raise my shoulder ever so slightly to make it hard for her to get underneath my jawline. So when she goes to start strangling me from here, it's not an easy thing. Now there's always going to be times where she can start behind the ear, she can go down towards the chin, she can start turning my chin and now like oh man I'm getting my chin turned. From this position when she goes to start going underneath my neck, now for me what I can't have is this coming up. So right from this position I take my chin and I just glue it to my opposite side shoulder. Now she's underneath my jawline on the right side but not on the left side. And now from here when she goes to crawl across, I'm going to exploit the space that she hasn't covered yet with her upper forearm and elbow. What she needs is her elbow to be flush to my chin, like so. So I exploit the space on the opposite side. So when she goes to crawl across, I just quickly turn my chin and I go back inside my partner's forearm and this will force her to start over where now she goes in, she walks it across, maybe I'm here, maybe she can't even get it. Maybe she walks it across and from here it starts to get under my jaw so I glue it to the other side. Now she goes to walk it up. If I stay here, she slowly crawls underneath my chin and I get beat. So right from here she goes to crawl underneath and I quickly go up and down. I turn my head and I exploit the space that she hasn't taken up yet at the upper forearm and the crease of the elbow. So then she's going to start walking, walking, walking. If I stay here, I lose. If I move, I win. Now that brings me into my early defenses from here where now I can use a combination of a primary defensive hand and a combination of pommeling with my head, looking at my near shoulder, looking at my far shoulder, looking at my near shoulder, looking at my far shoulder, depending on how deep my partner is into the strangle, I can go into the early escapes before the strangle is actually set. All right, so now the strangle is actually set. This is no fun. Once the strangle is actually set and it's through like so, once the strangle is actually set and we're in like so, it's going to be very difficult for me now to start going in and looking to free my arms. There's two general approaches that I can look for. What you do and how you choose to operate is going to be situational based and it's going to be a lot of a sensitivity thing and just experience on whether or not you feel you can free this hand here or whether or not you can free this hand here. There's always going to be times where you feel like your partner's head is out of position, where you feel like you can free this hand, and you feel like you can start posting on your partner's head. The first thing we're going to look to do is from here we're going to look to move our partner's head position. She puts a garrotte in place and from here she has my hand trapped. From this position I'm going to clear this grip by rolling my wrist forward and punching my hand down towards my hips. I roll my wrist forward, I punch it down towards my hips. Now when she starts to apply the strangle I have to get my head out to the floor. I have to exploit the space between my partner's connected chin and the top of her hand. The way that I do this is by going in and posting on my partner's forehead here. When she goes to start strangling me I just push the head up and I just walk my head between that space. I exploit that space like so. Now once we're in this position it's the easiest thing, she has no control over me. I have to make sure she doesn't go back and control this hand. I just tuck this elbow right to my ribcage. When she goes to control me in the back crucifix once again she can't. Now I just pull this elbow free, post it on the knee, and we're out and about ready to go. The first option is from here she gets underneath my jaw, she locks everything in. I strip this grip like so. Now if I try to take my head out and her chin and her hand are connected she has a closed circle around my head. It can't do anything from here. The first thing I have to do is I have to pull the elbow down and post my partner's forehead. When she tries to keep that connection I can always push it out and away enough or I can turn towards my partner and I can use a thumb post to free my elbow and we're out and we're safe. There's always going to be a time when the strangle's in place and I feel like one, I can't even free this hand and I just can't get it out of there in time. Or two, I free the hand and I feel like I'm pushing the head but it's not going anywhere. I can't get the space I need and the time available. So whenever I see this she has her strangle in place. Now from here I have to start turning towards my partner's legs. From here I use my knee inside my partner's knee and I use that to pull my elbow free. She goes to lock up tight. This will not be easy but this is what you're looking to do. You need to get your elbow past your partner's knee line. So from here she goes to lock up tight. I take a grip in like so and I just push and I look to free my arm. Once I free my arm I use a thumb post on my partner's elbow. And now when she goes to strangle me because it's only one arm, it's not nearly as strong and she's not throwing her hips into it like she would be on my back if she had a girl. So there's no lower body engagement here. So from here when she goes to finish me I can easily thumb post and I can start walking and easily clear my head out and now from here we're out and away. So if I feel like I can't free my hand at all from here or I free the hand and I can't post on the head and she's strangling me and now from here I can't sit up, I can't come here and I can't post because she has that control. Whatever the case is I feel like I'm running out of time. Whenever I see this she has her legs pinched and from here I go and I look to start taking my knee to the inside of my partner's knee. If I feel that she's pointing her knee towards the ceiling like she is now and I can't get my knee to my partner's knee I have to walk my partner's bottom, my partner's near knee down to the floor by walking along the mat and pulling my right elbow down and then I take my knee inside. When she goes to hold on to that arm I use a shearing method to take that arm out and now from here I can either one, reach for the hand which if it's deep you won't be able to even reach it but I can try if it's not very well placed but the best of all is always from here I use a thumb post on my partner's elbow. When she continues to strangle I don't want to walk in this direction towards my partner's hips I want to walk out and away. So now from here I start looking towards my partner's head, she goes to start strangling me I can easily move out and away. So those are your two directions of escape. One is escaping to the left with the left hand, one is freeing the right hand and moving out and away. You'll be fighting to do these and it's a sensitivity thing you'll see which one's better at the time but ultimately you'll be looking to do these simultaneously. So she's strangling me, I should be looking to free this hand as I'm looking to free my right hand with my knee, so I'll be here. And I'll get one or the other, I'll be fighting to post on the forehead and I'll be fighting to free my bottom hand at the same time. So we can play with escapes of freeing the left hand, posting the head, freeing the right hand, freeing the elbow and then thumb posting on their elbow. So we can go in two different directions and in a live situation you'll be doing these both simultaneously trying to fight to see which one you get to first. Alright so our endgame here is again a time based thing. It's can I free my hand, can I free my elbow before my partner ends up strangling me and I have to tap or I go unconscious. So it all comes down to will I be able to free my hand fast enough to post my partner's head, get my head out of the way and alleviate strangling pressure or will I be able to insert my knee inside my partner's knee, free that elbow, thumb post and alleviate strangle pressure. If you can do either one of those before your partner strangles you, great. If you can't, you're going to get finished. So just understand it's a time based thing and you're trying to hit one of these two defenses before your partner actually enacts a strangle and you have to end up tapping. Alright so we have about five hours of strangle escapes here. The triangles were a big part of it. You know we went through all five triangles and then we went through a lot of front headlock guillotine, dar stuff. We went through pretty much all the strangles, all the high percentage strangles that I can think of besides rear nakeds because I had a whole section on that in the back escapes series. The reason why I specifically didn't go over buggy strangle defenses is because they're not highly effective and they don't work across a multitude of weight classes and age ranges and they rely completely on physical attributes. So I'm not even bothering with that because they're not really that high percentage. Maybe I'll do an Instagram breakdown on a buggy strangle defense just so people stop getting caught and I can stop hearing about them because I hate them because they just rely solely on physical attributes. So that's why I didn't do it. That's why I didn't add them in here. But yeah, hopefully you guys enjoyed that. I know it was a lot of content, about five hours of strangle escapes here. And I added some of the setups. Obviously there's so many setups that you can't put them all into one instructional and I can't even think of them all. Every single setup and combination that you have in Jiu Jitsu for all these strangles here. But I wanted to add some of the main setups so you can see the early defenses and just recognizing the danger and then go into the early escapes and the late escapes once we're actually in the strangle before we're actually getting finished. And then once we're actually deep in the strangle, our last ditch effort to try to escape. As well as that, I wanted to always include the dilemma games between triangles and strangles and arm locks where we have a tri-mora or triangle arm bar combination and fighting out of both of those at the same time and going through early and late escapes there. So other than that, hopefully you guys enjoyed it. Thank you FNAGS as always and Miss Sunny here. We haven't filmed in what, six months? You have something to say? How was it? It was a little rough. I was a little rusty in the beginning. Also I really have an injury on my wrist. It's a true story. She's had an injured wrist for a while. And then everything like to pose or like some movements, it really, really hurts but I can't show on camera so I definitely look stupid doing some stuff because I'm avoiding to do it because it hurts. But nothing. She still definitely doesn't know which side to jump to on the Geek Team. I hold that. I hold that. That's true. Okay, I have to post, right? To post and move. And I have to click the wrist because it's out sometimes. But he's a jerk, of course, you guys already know. So he doesn't care. That's not what she said yesterday. She said I couldn't move. I just couldn't move. She didn't say anything about her wrist yesterday. The story's changing. No, no, because it, listen, because if I say it too much, you're going to think, oh, you're a pussy, whatever. It's not, you know. So anyways, guys, I hope you guys enjoy. It was a really nice content. I learned a lot. And, you know, I'm being here since Blue Belt. So I'm allowed to make some mistakes sometimes. And now you're a brown belt though. I'm a brown belt. Maybe get your black belt before 50. Goodbye, guys. Thank you. Hopefully you enjoyed.
