 All right, so now we've looked at getting chest to chest or using the overback grip and passing from the overback grip versus a high knee shield with no real upper body frames, double shoulder post, and of course the most tricky to deal with, the cross shoulder post. Now we're going to do the same format for the look for the low knee shield, no real upper body grips, double shoulder post, cross shoulder post, and very similar of course once we get to the overback grip it's pretty much the same, but we need to get past this annoying low knee shield first. My partner plays with a low knee shield. Typically she has locked legs. If she has unlocked legs from here, it's a pretty easy thing to just go in and start playing a game where I start pushing the legs down and then switching to overback grips or stuffing the leg on by and moving my partner's leg around. It's a pretty easy thing to move my partner's leg around from here. So many times what you'll see is if your partner plays with unlocked legs, they'll have a low knee shield. The second you start to pressure them, they're always going to move to a high knee shield. Like if I start coming forward to crowd my partner and she has a cross shoulder post for example, she's not going to stay with a low knee shield because now if I beat the upper body frame, there's nothing stopping me really from getting to her. She can't really push me away sufficiently with this low knee shield here. So if I start moving towards my partner and there's unlocked legs and she stays with a low knee shield, normally what she's going to do is she's going to move to a high knee shield to dominate my upper body. And even if I do beat this shoulder post, I'm still running at the frames here and she has a high knee shield to stop me. So she'll move, if she has unlocked legs most of the time, she'll be playing with a low knee shield, but they're always going to move between high and low knee shield. If someone's playing a true low knee shield, they're most likely going to unlock their legs and put that knee right in your hip. So now I'm going to move the leg around, it's not going to happen. And then when I go to come forward towards my partner, it's hard because I can't really take my right knee off the floor and start driving weight into my partner because of the fact that she's using two legs now, locked legs to push me away. It's hard for me to get to that far shoulder. And this is a real annoying low knee shield, when a partner has locked legs, low knee shield, and of course with the most annoying upper body frame, the cross shoulder post. So this is going to be a real issue from here. So we're going to look at ways to get past our partner's low knee shield or force them into situations where they have to convert to a high knee shield. And then we go back into a high knee shield gambit and get to chest to chest or over back grip. All right, so we're going to start looking now at getting past this low knee shield with no shoulder post, and then we'll work through the rest of the upper body shoulder post with a double shoulder post and the cross shoulder post. All right, so whenever I see my partner has a low knee shield, the first thing I do is I test my partner's lock. I see how strong the lock is. And many times you'll be able to separate your partner's legs by using a simple sprawling method where we hip switch, we turn our inside hip down and we separate the legs and we crush the legs together. And crushing the legs together creates a dilemma. And we'll look at this in a second. The first thing I always look to do whenever I see this is we're on a low knee shield. The first thing I always look to do when our hands are going to be dealing with no shoulder post first, first thing I always look to do is I step a leg up like so, and I always make sure I monitor my partner's inside leg. If I have my knee down, I can cover my partner's inside leg from coming back in and recovering to a full guard. So when I step a leg up, I'm always again, posting that inside leg. And I want my partner just pulling her knee back in. And now she's in an open guard scenario and she faces me. And now I have to pass open guard. I'd rather be in half guard. So when I take my knee out of position, I step my leg up, I put my hand in place. And now from here, I just come forward towards my partner's far shoulder like so. And now I play a game where I hip switch and I sprawl my right leg back and I test the lock of my partner's legs. You won't always be able to open your partner's legs, but many times you will be able to. All right. So we're going to play a game where we test the lock of our partner's legs. She goes to lock up and I feel like it's not really that tight. We just drive forward towards our partner with the upper body. And then we sprawl and we turn our hips down. We separate our partner's legs like so. And from here, we crush them two legs together and we keep weight over our partner's legs. And from here, there's a variety of different pummeling options we're going to look at. We're going to have to start passing from here. And then if our partner defends by opening up the knees, then we go into a dilemma of flattening our partner out and working from there. Okay. So the first thing I always do, she moves from a high knee shield maybe to a low knee shield. So you put that low knee shield in place and I'm here. I play a game where I'm pulling, she goes to push, or I'm pushing, she goes to push, I play this game. And then from here, as she goes to push, I sprawl the legs back, I separate her legs, and now I have my legs sprawled back and away, hip turned down, and forward pressure into her while maintaining control of my partner's legs and hips. And that's where we're going to start all of our passing from right now. All right. So we initially cast our partner's lock and we can sprawl legs together. Now there's going to be a variety of passing options you're going to have from here, and it gets pretty intricate with leg pummeling and leg riding. But the first thing we're looking for is once I crush the legs together, can I make a transition from dealing with the legs to controlling the upper body in some way? So that's my question. So can I crush the legs together? And once I have the legs sprawled together, can I make a transition to an underhook? At least an underhook here. Okay. If I can get control of an underhook like so, what I want to make sure of is that my partner can't pummel the underhook back in. It's going to be hard to go right to a cross-facing underhook because you're kind of too extended from this position. So I generally just go in, I put an underhook in place, and then from here, I just take my forehead right to my partner's trap muscle like so, and I cover, I connect my ear and my shoulder like we did before so my partner can't pummel in between the space and take the hand back inside. When she goes to pummel the hand back in, she can't. When she tries to go way overhead, she can't. The only way that she can actually get the hand back inside is by turning so far that she gives me a claw grip, and this is no good. Now I can start going in and going into kata gatame and passing and even exposing her back. So she can't take the arm all the way around the head without giving me back exposure, so it doesn't make sense for her to do that. So I go in, I take a grip here, my partner's trap like so, I glue my forehead to her trap and I connect my ear and my shoulder. When she goes to bring that underhook back in now, it's not easy. And now from here, I play a game where I like to start going in and pummeling my leg behind my partner's like so. Now once my leg is behind my partner's leg, it's a pretty hard thing for her to trap me from here. If I don't pummel my leg behind my partner's leg, she can use a scissoring motion of her legs to follow me and make it hard for me to move my leg around. So the first thing I do if I can get to an underhook, or regardless of whether or not I get an underhook, is to pummel my ankle behind my partner's leg just like so. Now from this position, we can start to go into work from here. Assuming I can get to a crossface and an underhook or at least an underhook, I can pass to either side pretty easily from here. If I want to, I can start to run around behind my partner and I end up with a near side underhook, or I can run around in front of my partner and I end up with a far side underhook. So from this position, whenever I see I can start controlling my partner's leg and I have an underhook, we can come forward now and we can start going in and there's a variety of different things that we can do from here. The easiest is from here, we just go in and we post on our partner's leg and we quickly pop up, we take our hip to our partner's hip. From this position, we just take our knee and we just slide it right down to the floor like so. Now we have a choice of either going into an overhook like so, she's posting on my hip a lot of times like so, so I can't go in and pass. I take an overhook and I switch my head down to the floor like so. And now when she goes to recover from here, I just take my foot out and we can easily pass and get to a nice top pin into side control. Conversely, this time we go in, we post on my partner's leg, from here we take our hip up and now this time we go in and we can take a cross face. Both are very good options. I'm not going to say one's better than the other, they're both very good. And now from here, we go in with the cross face, we put our knee down to the floor and now we go to start passing from here. It's a pretty easy thing to take our legs out and over. In general, if I feel like I'm dealing with someone who's uber explosive, I usually generally go to an underhook and an overhook rather than a cross face. If someone's way bigger or stronger or way more explosive than you and you pass and you go to post and your partner posts the hip and your weight's loaded off, they can aggressively roll and bridge and take you over to the side. So if I feel like someone is way more explosive than me or just very explosive in general, then from here I go in, I post and now I block the head. So now she gets to post the hip, when she gets to bridge, there's no bridge now. All right, so both are very good. If I'm dealing with someone who's very, very explosive, I generally prefer overhook and underhook. But cross face and underhook are good as well. Now this time we go in and we move to an underhook on our partner like so. Now we don't want our following and off balancing with the legs. So the first order of operation is to expose the ankle. If we can't expose the ankle, she has a strong back heel, if you feel like it's hard to expose the ankle, from here I just walk my right knee up. Right now it's hard to get behind my partner's ankle. So I expose the ankle if I can't do it by walking my knee forwards. Now she has the back heel, we can always expose the ankle. The further you walk forwards, the more ankle exposure you have. Now I split the legs. Now when she goes to keep control of my leg, it's difficult. And now from here, we can start going in, passing in this direction like we just did. From this position we can also start posting on our partner's leg, and we can start walking around behind our partner. When she goes to follow, she can't follow me with that far leg. All I have to do is sprawl past this butterfly hook, and now from here it's a pretty easy thing to go in and start moving around and passing now with a near side underhook. And now from here, we can go in, punch a second underhook into place, and start passing from there. The worst case scenario is you start walking around behind your partner, and they aggressively straighten this leg as you go to walk around. They straighten this leg, and you end up trapped in half guard, chest to chest, with a near side underhook, where we can start passing with our partner flattened out on the opposite side. But you still have chest to chest contact, and you can start working from there. So if I can make good contact and get control of my partner's head and shoulders, whether it be with an underhook or a cross-facing underhook, or even sometimes double underhooks, this is more rare because your partner usually has his hand inside, his elbow inside. If I can make contact and get an underhook like so, first thing we do is we always go in, we split the legs. Now from this position, we can go in and we can start posting on our partner's leg like so. From here, we come up, we go hip to hip. From this position, we go in either one, right to a cross-face, or two, if we try to cross-face and she stops me, or she goes to post to my hip, we go in and we take an overhook like so. Now from here, when she goes to move, we just go knee to the floor. She goes to recover, we just walk back towards our partner's hip like we always do, going double underhooks, or going top head and arm. And then from here, we cover the hips first. We're ready to go in and get our top pin. If on the other hand, I see I'm not going to look to start to pass in that direction, then from here we can always pass behind our partner. So we have two passing directions. So we split the legs, this is number one. Now from this position, we post on our partner's leg. When she goes to start following me, it's a pretty hard thing for her to do from here. And now from here, we go in, she goes to start moving around, we shelf the leg, we move to a situation where we can control our partner and we can pass easily from there. If you feel like your partner goes to aggressively turn towards you and goes to bridge an off balance to you, just start tripping, you can either play a game where you backtrack and you step back into half guard. Now she goes to trap you, then you slide across the opposite side. Now she's 90% of the way towards an escape, and now we're in three quarter mount with a good underhook, and we can move to double underhooks and then start converting and going into passes from there. So you have many options from this position. That's assuming that we can crush our partner's two legs together, sprawl the knees together, they stay together, and we can get to an underhook. Okay? If I can get to an underhook and I can make a conversion to a cranial shift, you have a lot of good passing options here. So I sprawl the legs together from this position. The first thing I want is to make it hard for her to track my legs. So if I could try to do any of these passes and she has a strong back heel, it's hard to do any of that. So the first thing I do, if I can get to the underhook, good head position. Now I expose my partner's ankle. She has to follow me now. It's not easy. She has to follow me now. Not easy. And now from here, we can easily pass and go into all of our attacks from top pins. All right. So this time we crush our partner's legs together and we split the legs and we control the ankle, but we don't manage to actually get control of our partner's head and shoulders, whether it be through an underhook or through a cross-facing underhook. So here, we have pretty good control of our partner's upper body from here. When she has to move the upper body away, it's pretty difficult and I can always get to either over-under, double-under, or cross-facing underhook. But many times we find ourselves in a situation where we crush the legs together, my partner has tight elbows and I can't get control over my partner's upper body from here. Whenever I see this, I just put a wedge of my elbow right behind my partner's back. So when she has to shrimp away, it's a difficult thing to do. Now from this position, I keep weight over my partner's legs and again, I look to expose that ankle. If my partner's just relaxing and there's no tension, I just pummel behind. If she has a strong back heel, I can't pummel behind from here. If I walk that knee forward, I expose my partner's ankle and I walk the knee back. Now from this position, it's hard for me to start passing across into this direction because of the fact that now, if I go to pass, as I go to pass, and the fact that you can't do it, my partner can punch in an underhook and bum me forward and now she can go into attacks right off my pass and it creates movement and a lot of times your partner ends up escaping. So from this position, what I like to start doing is from here, I go in and I post. Now as I start to post, I attempt a couple of different things from here. Number one is I can pop up into this position. Instead of putting my knee on the floor and going into this position like so, I just go in and I put a shoelace behind my partner's leg right here. And now from here, I play a game where I start leg riding on my partner and I take two legs behind. My partner goes to move me around from here, her legs are crushed together, it's not an easy thing to do. And now from here, I can play a game where I can start putting my partner's hips between my two legs. And now when she goes to open up those legs, she does it on my terms, and as she goes to open up those legs, it's a pretty easy thing, we can start going in and passing the side control. Or as she goes to aggressively open the legs, I go in, I let her open the legs and I pass them out. And now I start with an initial leg ride and that gives me time to follow my partner's reactions. So instead of putting my knee on the floor and passing to this side, I have no control of the underhook, which means she can punch the underhook in. From here, I just split the legs and we just pop up, we go hip to hip and we just take our heel to our butt and pommel right behind like so. Now from here, when she goes to move around, I have weight over my partner's knees. I pommel two legs behind. And now from here, she goes to move, and we play a game like so. It doesn't look like you have much control, but your partner's legs are crushed together. So when she goes to move around from here, you can go in and start passing. It's a very reliable way to start passing your partner with leg riding transitions. Conversely, instead of passing in front of your partner, because I have no control of the upper body, I just post, I split the legs, and I just walk around in this direction like so. And now as your partner goes to face you, we just put an inside bicep tie in. As your partner goes to face you, I slide beneath the floor, so I'm looking to move into a leg drag situation. Right now from here, I have time. As my partner goes to shrimp away, I have time to go in and start punching in cross faces. I have time to go in and start punching in underhooks. And now as I go to start moving around from this position, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start passing in various ways. So anything that gets me either one, I don't have control of my partner's upper body with a cranial shift, with an underhook or various upper body grips. Anything that puts me on top of my partner's legs to start leg riding, moves me around behind my partner, is what I'm looking for. So I find myself in a position where I crush the legs together off this low knee shield, and we're here. We split the legs, we control my partner's hips, not letting them move away from me. And then everything from here starts with an initial post. Keep my partner's two legs together. I have a choice of either just running around to the side, she goes to follow me with a butterfly hook, makes it hard. Then we can go back in and start leg riding again if we want to. Or we can split the legs with a leg drag. Or we can let our partner face us. And as they do so, we go in, we work to get that inside bicep tie, and make our transition to top pins. Or we can play a game, where from here, we go in, and right away we start leg riding. My partner goes to move me around from here. You'll see it's not easy. My partner goes to push one leg down. Her best bet is to push exactly my legs down and bring her knees in. So from here, the second I see someone got a post in my leg, I just take it back and I split my legs, and I put her hips between my two legs. Now when she goes to push that knee down, she pushes me into a situation where we can come through and start moving into top pins regardless. So if I have control of my partner's upper body, you have the option to pass behind your partner or you have the option to start passing in front of your partner. If you have no control of the upper body, you don't make a cranial shift before you pass the legs, you're either leg riding or moving behind your partner. And you also have the option, when you have the cranial shift, I can come in from here, post my partner's legs. There's another reason why I can't start leg riding from here. Now my partner goes to move around, it's not easy. And now you have a variety of different leg riding options that you can look to go from here. And now from here, we can either go forward like we did, or my partner can open up the legs and go back to this side, double underhooks, you can start playing from here and working. So you can also go into leg riding scenarios if you have control of your partner's upper body. There's no real reason to do it. You can just do it if you're trying to fatigue your partner, like I said, you're playing a more tactical game. But if you have control of your partner's upper body, and the legs crushed together, it's pretty easy thing to just pass right away if you want to. But tactically, if you want to tire them out, you want to stay in their guard longer, but give them a give them a hope of recovering or attacking you. But it's not really one there because you have control of the situation. You can go into leg riding scenarios, but there's no real need to do it. So many times when we go to flat our partner's legs out and bring the two knees together, what happens is your partner obviously knows that the knees are getting crushed together, this is not good for them. So as I go to sprawl the leg back and crush your legs together, they'll extend the leg and try to reinsert a high knee shield. So what will happen is, and this happens very commonly, especially when I have a cross shoulder post in place, where I go to sprawl my partner's legs through, and the second I go to sprawl my partner's legs down like so, she extends the bottom leg, all the way, sorry, top leg, all the way through, through, through, through. And then from here, she goes to bring it back up and insert a high knee shield or a low knee shield and put her leg back in place. But she doesn't want to get her legs crushed in this position. So the second I go to sprawl, she'll immediately extend that bottom leg through and then reinsert the leg and split the knees as I'm trying to bring them together. So the second I go to crush my partner's legs together, and from here, I feel, if she goes to extend that leg through, I switch my hips back in the opposite direction. So as she goes to extend, I just throw my left knee in like so, she goes to extend and I take my right knee across my partner's far hip and I go into work from here. And now from here, we can either go into cross face, we can start moving to go to inside bicep tie, and we can work with the same pylon options we looked at before. So whenever I see I go in, I start to crush my partner's leg together. I feel her go to extend the leg. The second I see this, go ahead, I go in one, two. It's important, I chase my partner's far hip with my knee. I go in one, she goes to extend. As she goes to extend, if I just go in, I run into the knee shield. So I open up my hip, go ahead, and I chase my partner's far hip with my knee. So what this will look like, if she has no hands in place, and this is going to be very similar with the cross shoulder pose. We go in here, she has feet locked, we step the leg up. From here, I sprawl my legs through, she goes to extend, we flatten our partner out. And now from here, we start working at the waist, the upper body, we move into position to start passing. Okay? So she has a knee shield in place, having a hard time moving around from here. The second I feel I can separate her legs, I try to crush them together. She realized this and extends the leg and tries to reinsert a knee shield. And now as I feel that happen, we go in, we flatten our partner out, and we're ready to start working from chest to chest. All right, so now we're working low knee shield, no real upper body frames. Let's look at how we can beat this knee shield by quickly popping up and then getting to upper body chest to chest position. So this time, my partner has a low knee shield like so, and she has legs locked. All right, what we're going to look to do is first, we're going to look to start building up to our feet. So we go in, we block that bottom leg, we post the leg up, and then we start moving our knee up like so. Now from this position, we start moving out towards our partner's center line, and look to start pummeling our knee to the inside position. That is our elbow to the inside position. And now from here, as always, we open up that knee, we drive our right knee to our left hip, we take our left knee to our right hip, and now we're in chest to chest, where we can take our elbow now outside our partner's hip, and we can start crashing the far shoulder and going in. Okay, so this is a great way to work. Similarly, as we work from the high knee shield, where from here we feel like we can't get an elbow inside, and we go in, we start pinning our partner's leg, we start stepping up, and now from here, we start taking an elbow inside. We can also play a game where I start pushing into my partner like so, I block my partner's leg, and now we're going to quickly pop up, and instead of moving all the way up to our feet, we're just going to move our knee off the floor ever so slightly, and then we're just going to run in this direction and hip switch. So from here, I go to push, she pushes back, now from here, I just shoot my left knee towards my partner's hip, we just hip switch like so, and now we drop our right knee down towards our partner's far hip, and we cover the space, and we're chest to chest. This time, we go into a situation where we move not quite to a split squat, but we don't stay down on our knees either. So from here, I step a leg up, I cover my partner's leg, I start pushing towards my partner, she goes to push back, and now from here, I just hit a quick hip switch. And now from here, we can go in, cover our partner's hips, and get chest to chest. So we have one, where we go all the way up, go full split squat briefly, and two, where I just pose the hand on the hip. And now I play a game where I just quickly run my partner's knees towards the center line, I take my right knee to her left hip, my left knee to her right hip, and I hit a quick subtle hip switch. She goes to push towards me, and now from here, we're in, ready to go, and we fight for upper body grips from there. Okay, so rising up, either getting an elbow inside, or using like a half rise to a split squat, where from here, we can just hit a quick hip switch, beat our partner's knee that the slides on by our hips, and we end up with hips flat, chest to chest, and we're ready to go. All right, real quick, I'm going to run through this, because it's basically the same thing as the high knee shield. We're going to go into hip switching methods, which will get us to this over back grip, or the reverse under hook, where from here, she goes in, she locks her legs, and now from this position, I'm pushing into my partner, she goes to push back into me, and from here, we just shoot our left knee in, and we switch that over back grip, or now from here, she either has a choice of bringing in the inside, where I can go to my ankle scoop, or she can go and put her knee out and start bridging, and then we're into the same position we were in before, we have to go through all of our over back series passes right from there. So we go in, we start pushing into our partner, from here, she has a low knee shield, legs locked, as I feel my partner push back into me, I let her push, I create some separation, and from here, we just shoot into this over back grip, we're now ready to go in and start to play our game with all of our passes that we looked at before. So using a hip switch to get to an over back grip on our partner, and using the same series that we looked at before, it's the same thing with low knee shield and high knee shield when your partner has no upper body grips. Now let's go into a low knee shield when my partner has upper body frames with a double shoulder post. Now this is going to be very different because it's harder to move my partner's leg around when she's in a low knee shield. When she's in a high knee shield, it's a pretty easy thing to move and feint and twitch with my hand to move my partner's leg around, and then finally when I want to actually stuff it or move it into a different position, I hit one big movement and I get the leg out of the way, and then I come forward to go inside the arms. A big problem with this, when I try to do this with a low knee shield, is that I can't really get my partner's leg out of the way. So it's hard for me, even if I beat the upper body, I've got to come forward and I still run into the knee shield. So it's hard for me to move my partner's leg out of the way. So what I'm going to look to start to do from here is going to be a little bit different when my partner has a double shoulder post, and we're going to go into that now. You're not going to look at stuffing the leg, beating the leg like we normally would, and then coming forward and just easily getting to the inside position, and then getting chest to chest. So it's going to be a little bit different here. We're going to look at some ways to get past this double shoulder post with a variety of different pummels, and then we're going to move from there. Now we're going to look at using rising methods to quickly beat our partner's knee and get to the inside position versus a double shoulder post. Now understand that stuffing method, where I stuff the leg on by, and sprawling methods, which we looked at before, aren't going to work with a double shoulder post. And here's the reason why. Because there's so much range she has, and so much ability to push me far out and away. The second I go to sprawl, I can't stuff the leg by because her legs are locked. The second I use a sprawling method, like so, and I try to get close contact with her, she immediately just uses a stiff arm on two of my shoulders, and uses that to push me away, and now there's so much room between myself and her that you can't control anybody from here. So what's going to happen is, if she goes to start sprawling my legs together, she's on two knees, she goes to start sprawling my legs together, once she goes to control me from here, I can just push my partner away and trip out and away. It's much easier to use sprawling methods where there's no upper body grips or a cross shoulder post, because a cross shoulder post is more robust from stopping people from coming forward towards you. We'll talk about this in a second. But there's less range of motion. You need a connection to your partner, like so, and you need to be coming forward towards them when you crush your legs together. Here because there's so much extension when she goes to crush my legs together, she can do it, but when she goes to control me, I can use that extension to push my partner away. So we're going to go right into rising methods because sprawling methods and stopping methods aren't going to work from here. So instead, we play a game where she does a double shoulder post. I use that same rising method we looked at before. We take an elbow inside, and this time from here, as I'm going to take my right knee down like so, my left knee comes down like so, we just take two hands. Once I cover my partner's knee, I go from the hip and the knee to two hands inside. So now she has to push me away and trip away. I just bat those hands off, I crash her shoulder, and now we're in, we're going to work. So what this will look like, if she goes double shoulder post, I'm trying to sprawl, it's not working. I'm trying to come forward, it's not working. From here, we go in, we take a knee up, she goes to start moving me around, I'm pushing into my partner. In one motion, we jump, we move our knees to the proper position, and as we move our knees to the proper position, what we don't want is to try to come forward, and then the knee comes in, and I end up on the frames. So from here, she goes to keep everything inside, I'm pushing, pushing, pushing, I jump into this position here. Now we're ready to go in, we take that inside position, and we're ready to start working. Inversely, we go in, this time, we don't come all the way up. We just go in, we start pushing towards the far shoulder. I get a pushback reaction, I go with my partner. I get a pushback reaction, I go with my partner. I get a pushback reaction, I go with my partner, and now from here, we just go in, we get a quick hip switch, and we end up chest to chest, ready to go. We take two hands inside, and we pull ourselves into a chest to chest passing position. So rising method's pretty similar with double shoulder post, except we have to come inside the arms now and clear those shoulder posts before my partner brings that knee back inside and starts framing with a high knee shield. All right, so now let's look at double shoulder post, low knee shield, how to hip switch and get to an overback position. Pretty similar as the one we looked at before, this time instead of stuffing a leg by, we're just going to go right into the hip switch. So this time, we play the same pull-push dynamic where I push into her, she goes to push into me, and then I pull backwards just to make enough space so there's a little bit of a disconnect between my body and her frames. Now from here, we come in and we take one inside bicep tie. This time, instead of going to a collar tie and pulling myself in because I can't beat the legs though, I have to hip switch past it. So from here, she goes to start pushing, she comes up towards me like so, I come inside one, I come inside the other, and then as I open this frame out, I just slide by this frame by blading my shoulders and we switch to an overback grip like so. And now because we have an inside bicep tie with our right hand, we can almost always square our hips, crack that far shoulder, and transition to the lock that we love so much with a 10-finger grip. So from here, we go in, we're playing against this low knee shield, we go towards our partner, we're playing this game here, we're pushing towards the far shoulder, then Ashley goes to push, we pull, and now we take our two hands in like this. Now from here, we take our left knee to our partner's hip, we take our right hand to the inside bicep, and we just shoot across with our left hand like so, and we get to this overback grip. And now depending on where we want to go, we can either play from here, or we can start to go into submissions, we can go to underhooks, things like that. We can do this as well from a situation where we quickly rise up and pop up into a split squat where I'm coming here, here's a low knee shield, and then from here I go to pull, push, we pull, push, and then I pull out and away, and from here, we come through, we dive by, and we get to that overback grip, and we can start passing right from there. So using a hip switch, this time instead of going to a collar tie, I'm trying to pull myself in linear to the far shoulder, I can't get past that leg, okay? So instead, I hip switch past the knee, but you have to push me away with that knee shield, it falls and brushes off past my hip, and now from here, we're into an overback, we're chest to chest, chest to chest position, and ready to go into all of our passing game and submission game from there. All right, now we're going to go into ways to get chest to chest to get to an overback grip with a low knee shield and a cross shoulder post. And again, we run into some problems here because of the fact that we can't stuff the leg by and because of the fact that it's hard to close distance between my chest and their chest due to the cross shoulder post. So the main issue we face here, is that anybody good, is going to be using this cross shoulder post, they have legs crossed, it's hard to move the legs right away, and the problem is, is that when I go to start hip switching or getting to my partner's head, it's a difficult thing. If I do go to hip switch, it's hard because of the cross shoulder post and it makes it difficult for me to come through and actually get to overback grips and chest to chest positions. So we're going to have to look now at ways to get past this cross shoulder post, my partner's using a strong low knee shield with proper upper body frames. All right, so now we're going to look at, okay, this is almost the same as what we looked at before. I'm just going to talk about why this works now and it won't work against a double shoulder post. When my partner has no upper body grips, I can sprawl and hip switch and bring my partner's knees together and then pummel from there. My partner posts on both my shoulders, the grip is less robust in most ways, but it gives her more extension and more range of motion where she can push me away. So if I try to go into that sprawling method and crush the legs together, my partner can push me so far away with a double shoulder post that it's hard for me to actually get any offense from here, I'm too far away from her. The purpose of the cross shoulder post isn't to create as much distance as possible, it's just to dominate my shoulder line and give her a free hand. So this means it makes it hard for me to come forward into her, but does nothing to stop me from sprawling back and away. She can't lift my body weight with her shoulder. So from here, I lean towards my partner and I can still use that same sprawling method. So now when she goes to use that cross shoulder post to push me away, it's not nearly as effective. So I can still use all of my sprawling and pommeling methods right from here that we looked at before. Now if your partner switches, which she normally would if they were smart, if your partner switches to a double shoulder post, now you have to adjust. As you go to switch to double shoulder post, now you have to start going in and trying to go back into a situation where you can step over and get chest to chest. So you're going to be playing this dynamic game here and you're going to have to be using combinations as we've done in the past. You can't just use one move and, okay, I'm going to do this move. You have to use combinations of these moves together to actually break through your partner's defenses and get chest to chest or get to an overback grip. So from here, we start with a cross shoulder post. I attempt my sprawling methods and I use a splitting of the legs from here. I post and I go into all that series we looked at before. At any point my partner switches to a double shoulder post, maybe I lose the position completely. Maybe she pushes me away and I have to reset. It happens sometimes. But there's always opportunities in that time allotted where she goes to start doing that. And from here, I stop a knee, I run over into half guard, I force her into a chest to chest, and now we're looking to go in and start passing from here. All right, so you can use the sprawling methods when your partner has a low knee shield with a cross shoulder post because of the fact that she doesn't have as much range. The cross shoulder post does a better job of stopping you from coming forward towards the head, but does almost nothing stopping you from moving down and sprawling the legs back and away from the head. Okay, if at any point she switches to a double shoulder post, then you have to adjust and maybe you lose it altogether, or maybe you step over the knee and end up in half guard. And if you lose it, then no problem, you just force half guard again and you go back into your passive. But the sprawling method will work against a cross shoulder post. Okay, so when we looked at high knee shield cross shoulder post, the rising methods, they can work, but it's much harder to do when your partner has a high knee shield because of the knee elbow connection. So when she's on top of me, for example, when I have a high knee shield, I usually have either near knee elbow connection or a knee elbow connection. So my partner posts a hand on my hip like so, and rises up. From here, when she goes to start dropping down into half guard and passing my top leg, it's a pretty easy thing for me to start moving out and away. And if she doesn't control my hip, I just scoot out and away and I bring my knee back inside. If she goes over to control my hip with the elbow, like so, out on the outside, she's going to start crashing down to this position. Now she's giving me the inside knee position. So from here, as she goes to control my hip, I bring my knee and my elbow back together. So the knee elbow connection is what will make rising methods hard when your partner has a high knee shield because of my knee elbow connection. So when I'm using a cross shoulder post, she pops up to a split squat, and from here, she takes an elbow inside. When she goes to actually force me into half guard chest to chest, my knee with the high knee shield is always looking to connect to my elbow. So when she goes to flatten me out, I just bring my knee back to my elbow and the high knee shield's in place. When I play with a low knee shield, I never have a knee elbow connection. So it makes it easier with rising methods to get up past your partner's bottom leg because of the fact that if they're playing a low knee shield, you can get over the leg much easier. Now a good person's always going to switch a high knee shield or a low knee shield to try to recover to a high knee shield, but the low knee shield's unlocked now and you can use your high knee shield passing methods. This is a great way to either get past your partner's legs right away from the low knee shield or force them into a position where they have to switch to a high knee shield and then you can go to your previous attacks from there. Use this rising method when there's no knee elbow connection from a low knee shield and from here we go in, we post the leg and we move into this position. Now from here, I just go in, I start running towards my partner's legs, I bring the knees up to point towards the ceiling and I just drop into this position here. And like I talked about before, the cross shoulder post falls short in her ability to push me away. So from here, when she goes to actually use that cross shoulder post to stop me, yes, I can't get to my partner's upper body, but I can control her hips. And now I'm working at my own pace. From here, the only thing she can do is to keep her hands inside and I eventually, I paddle to the inside position and I lock my hands. Her only recourse from here is to switch to a double shoulder post, where from here, she tries to aggressively bridge towards me and shrimp away, like so. The second I see her switch and convert to a double shoulder post, like so, the second she goes to bridge, we crash the far shoulder. We take inside ties and now from here, we move to a cross face underhook and we go into our favorite sequences from there. So we use a rising method now against a low knee shield and a cross shoulder post. I can't come into my partner, I can't stuff the leg, but because of the lack of the elbow connection, I can always get inside my partner's knee and look to go in from there. So we come through, we take everything to the inside position, like so. Now from here, we go in, we take our right knee to our partner's hip and we just crash down like so. From this position, we go in and if she stays here, I stay on the hips. I take an inside bicep tie, she goes to start pushing me away with the cross shoulder, there's not enough range from here. So from here, I take my time, I come through and now from here, I can go in and eventually lock my hands. This time, we get in and she converts to a double shoulder post. If I stay here now, I'm going to be in trouble. She bridges towards me, she trips away. The second I see that double shoulder post conversion, we get ready. The second I feel a bridge, my head moves from center to crash in the far shoulder. And now from here, we go in and we're ready to work. This can be done if your partner's looking to play with a high knee shield. She has unlocked the legs and I get a hand and elbow to the inside. The problem is, as I go to flatten my partner out and I go in, the knee is so close to the elbow that a lot of times the knee comes back inside. Like I said, it's impossible to do, you can't do it. But with a low knee shield, there's a lot much more distance to travel and your partner's generally looking to play, if they pick the low knee shield, they're generally looking to stay with the low knee shield, which means there will always be inherently more space between the knee and the elbow. So from here, this gives me less of an issue to deal with. We come in, we start playing this pull push game, and then we just run like so, and we get up over the top. We look at our opponent's reaction. We either stay here and work our way to the inside, or we get ready for that big last ditch bridge, we crash the far shoulder, and I'm ready to start going in and playing a winning game. We can also do this, where we don't quite pop all the way up like we did before. We go in, we step a leg up, and now from here, instead of going up all the way off of a knee into a foot, we just play a game where she goes to move me around, I sag back towards my partner's hips. And now from here, I play that same game. And once again, it's possible to do this with a high knee shield. The problem associated with a high knee shield is that she's trying to have knee elbow connection. So she's going to be consciously thinking, as I go to flatten my partner out to go in, if I can beat it, great. A lot of times, I can end up here. A lot of times, she makes just enough space to that elbow to bring the knee back in, bring that high knee shield back in place, and start giving me issues. So the rising method can work high knee shield and low knee shield, but they're usually a little bit easier low knee shield because of the fact that the elbow and the knee are already initially so far disconnected. It's usually easier to beat that top leg, get over your partner's legs and flatten their hips out. All right, so now we're going to go into hip switching methods to get to an over back grip or to get chest to chest. Now again, I'm just going to run through these quick because they're relatively the same, but it's a low knee shield versus high knee shield. So it's important to throw them in there. We come in, we have this cross shoulder pose, and again, it's going to be very hard. Stuffing methods won't work because number one, the cross shoulder pose is in place. Number two, I can't stuff my partner's leg through because the legs are locked. So I play that same game where I come in and I use a variety of grips, whether it be this one, whether it be this one, whether it be this one, and I climb up my partner's body and I get to this over back grip. So the hip switch remains the same and you're still moving out and around your partner's knee. I'm not driving a linear into the shield like I was here or like I was here. I'm hip switching around the knee shield as I beat the upper body frames. So what beats the upper body frames is the upper body hand fighting. She has a cross shoulder pose in place. What beats that is this pull push dynamic where from here I beat the upper body frames. Now I have to beat the knee. I do this by brushing the knee on past and now from here we go in, we flatten our partner out, get to the over back grip. We start working and then we go into our over back and flatten out series that we're going to look at passing your partner's guard in a minute. So the hip switching is relatively the same. Same thing from, just real quick, we can use combinations like we've been always been doing. I'm not going to just use one method, a rising method, a sprawling method, a hip switching method. I'm going to use a combination of all these at the same time. So we're playing a game where from here we go in, she has the legs locked, maybe I try to sprawl. She goes to extend her legs and I try to get half guard, I can't do it. And then from here I go and I hit the over back grip. Maybe we go in, we're playing around. Maybe I go into a rising method, I'm flying around, I go to try to sprawl and separate my partner's legs. I fail, they come back in. We're in, we go back down. We try to come in, she recovers. Then from here she has a cross shoulder pose with a hip switch and from a situation where we're up in a split squat, we use that rising method to combine with a hip switching method. We get to an over back grip and we fly our partner out and start to get them to work. So everything I've been showing you guys is not just a use this method and you just do it till it works. You use that method, you do it till it works. It's a combination of everything and your partner's going to be switching from cross shoulder pose to double shoulder pose, from low knee shield to high knee shield. And the onus is on you to understand as your partner's changing grips, you have different reactions per whatever grip they're using. Alright so we're just going to recap these quick because a lot of them are saying we have Kimuras, we have Darces, we have attacks and threats on our partner's legs if our partner's legs are open. But it is important that you see that we can do these same attacks and I don't want to just leave them out and then, oh I can't do these attacks from low knee shield. So we still have the same Kimura sequences or from here, she's a low knee shield and cross shoulder pose for example, I still have these same sequences where I can pull a hand through and I can sit past my partner's knee shield. I still have a situation where she's a cross shoulder pose and from here I can pull the arm through and go in and hit a quick hip switch and go into Darce triangles. And if my partner's legs are unlocked and she has a low knee shield like so, I can still use scoop gripping. If my partner's legs are locked, I'm not going to be able to take a scoop grip effectively. It's going to be hard and awkward to kind of get your hand in here, the scoop grip really won't be there. So you can separate your partner's legs by just pulling the top leg up. If I want to, if I really want a scoop grip, I just separate my partner's legs by just pulling straight up like so. I get control of the leg, I pull it straight up and now from here as she goes to relock, I scoop the ankle. Now when she goes to relock her legs, I switch to a scoop and now I flare the elbow up so when she goes to relock them now it's hard and now I can force her into a high knee shield and then go into my scoop grip. So if her legs are locked, I don't try to take my hands in here. I go to the long end of the lever, we're playing a game, obviously I want to scoop my legs and move into that deep half guard. I reach down, I get to the top leg and I just pull that leg open. Now from here, I go in and I shoot my leg, my hand through. When she goes to relock, if I feel like it's not enough time to stop her, go back, then from here I just sprawl my leg back. She goes to relock, I lengthen the legs and now I switch to that scoop grip and now I take everything back in and now we're ready to go in and start playing our scoop grip game. So the attacks remain the same from here, you're just using a low knee shield a little bit different but you can still use the Kimura, you can still use the Darce, and you can still use the scoop grip on the attacks on your partner's legs provided you can open the legs if they have open legs for you with the low knee shield and then we can go to the same attacks we looked at previously from the high knee shield. Alright, so just before we move on to getting past a butterfly half guard where my partner has various upper body posts because it's a little bit different because your partner now has an inside foot, we're just going to recap these knee shields. Whenever we're looking to get chest to chest on our partner, looking to get through frames, we first have to address what is my partner's lower body position. Do they have a high knee shield? Do they have a low knee shield? Do they have a butterfly hook in? Once we establish what leg position they have, we have to look at what upper body position they have. Do they have any upper body frames on us at all, any upper body grips on us at all? Or do they have just elbows in tight waiting for us to come in and then blocking as we go to come in? The most common upper body frames and really only effective upper body frames are you have cross shoulder posts which are the most effective and you have double shoulder posts which are not as effective in most scenarios but there's a place for them as we looked at if you want to create distance between yourself and your partner. We looked at getting past every different upper body hand position that our partners could use. We looked at clearing both a high knee shield and a low knee shield. Our two main ways of getting past knee shields and that annoying top leg, that annoying top arm are hip switching methods where we sit in over back grips and then look to flatten our partner out or pass with over back grips or crashing the far shoulder. If we can crash the far shoulder and put the far shoulder on the floor and flatten your partner's shoulders and hips out, you're going to flatten them out. You're going to get to some kind of upper body control, make a cranial shift and then your passing will be relatively easy from there relative to obviously being engaged in a half guard with frames in the way. If you can't get to a situation where you can crash the far shoulder and flatten them out right away, then generally you're looking to hip switch past the knee shield as you're beating the upper body frames, get to an over back grip and then after you use the hip switch to get to the over back grip, then you're looking to either pass right from there with the ankle scoop method or whatever you choose, threaten submissions or of course if your partner avoids all that, you can flatten them out, pummel hands inside, get chest to chest and then pass from there. But the ultimate goal is getting chest to chest. If you can get chest to chest, get past those knee shields, get inside your partner's frames, feel the inside position and flatten people out, they're going to be carrying your body weight, it's going to be very fatiguing and you're going to be in the driver's seat from there. So just recapping getting past knee shields, now we're going to go into butterfly half boards.
