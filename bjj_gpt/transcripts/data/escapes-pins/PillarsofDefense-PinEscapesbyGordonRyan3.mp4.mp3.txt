 Alright, so we touched on this a little bit before, just reiterating it after we finish this section. The dilemma between grabbing your partner's legs and going into some kind of attack or re-guard and trying to grab a leg and then sprawling away from you and bringing knees inside. So this is the general game we're going to play here. Whenever I see I get to this underhook, I put my partner's hands on the floor, I know that I'm going to be able to keep my partner's hands on the ground for some amount of time, but eventually a wizard or a V-grip is coming back in and she's going to have to shut me down. So the second I put hands on the floor, I immediately go in and I try to go to my partner's legs. If I get to the legs, sorry there's noise outside, if I get to my partner's legs, I know that from here I can start going in, trapping them, coming up, or whatever we want to do from there. If I try to grab my partner's legs and she's very cagey about me actually getting a hold of her legs and she sprawls the legs back like so and starts to move away from me, there's no reason now why my left knee can't come to my left elbow. The only thing stopping me from bringing my left knee to my left elbow right now is that my partner's leg is wedging me in place. So I can always stood out and away and bring my knee into place, but from this position my partner's leg is inhibiting me from going knee to elbow. So I attempt to grab my partner's leg, she sprawls the leg back and away, and the second I see this, we just take knee to elbow like so and we take a cross shoulder post. Right now when she goes to control my head and inside bicep tie comes in, I have that knee elbow connection and now we can go in and go into a re-guard. So we play a basic game where the second we put our partner's hands on the floor with the underhook, we threaten a leg grab. If we get to a leg, we have great options, we can go in and start to attack. If we see that our partner sprawls the leg back and starts moving away, then we just bring everything back inside, we steal the inside position, and we go back into your basic and generic re-guards from there. Alright, so we talked about punching in a far side underhook, now let's look at the one that we all know, escaping with a near side underhook, where we spin out and around and can get back to inside position. A couple of important notes here. When we look to start spinning underneath our partner and she's in side control, I'm going to get hands inside and I'm going to look to get an underhook here like so. Now this is easier if you have your right hand inside, but it's not impossible to do otherwise. I can start bumping my partner forward, looking away from the cross face and then clear my hand underneath my partner's chest. But it's always going to be easier if we have this V-grip inside of our partner's armpit to guide her over my head as we go. So not impossible to do if we have outside far hand position, but much easier if we have the inside hand position like so. From here, as we look to start spinning underneath our partner, the main danger we're going to face is getting caught between our partner's two elbows and ending up in north-south. The main danger is as I'm going to start rotating, my partner takes the elbow around, she comes in and she traps me between her elbows and I end up stuck in north-south. So I get like a half rotation, but I get caught in north-south. So how can we address this issue? First of all, as I go, I'm going to start to bridge like so, and now I can use one of two methods. I can physically walk out and away, or I can bridge my partner like so, and then I can use a pendulum motion to move me out and away like so. Both are good options. One's not better than the other. I like them both. One is you run across and you actually move on your feet, and the other is you use a pendulum to just move your body to an angle. Both are very good. My first order of operations is I have to bridge to clear the cross face like so. And now from here, I start lifting with the left arm and I move to a situation where my head is outside my partner's elbow. Now the biggest danger is that she's going to take this elbow back across my body. So from here, I just post on my partner's tricep and I take a hand through to my partner's tricep like so. So I control my partner's arm. Now as she goes to bring that arm back across, because I have a post on it, she can't do so. And now I just bring it, I just go in, I connect my knee and my elbow. As she goes to put a pin back in place, we just take our legs back in front and we regard and we're out. Okay? Now as she comes in, we have everything inside and we have a hand inside of our partner's hip like so. From here, we're going to start to look to bring our hand through and underneath. So if I feel like I can't move my hand in position, I'm going to give a small bridge, because right now my hand's trapped in the position that it's in. So I give a small bridge into my partner and I look to just disconnect my chest with hers and I just wipe my hand through and underneath. Now from here, I create a lifting action with my right hand. I create a lifting action with my left hand. And I create a lifting action with a bridge that gets her moving out and away. So my head's clear from the cross face and underneath my partner's chest. And now I just start running out in this direction. Now her whole thing is to put my torso between her two elbows. So I take a post on my partner's tricep, we take a hand through and we take a second post on our partner's tricep. And now we can either walk, walk, walk, walk, or we can just take our knees to our chest. And now as our partner goes to take that elbow back across, she will physically turn me with her, with a, as she goes to take her elbow back across to the other side of my body, she will use that momentum to spin me and put her back in front of me. Okay, so we have everything in front. I give a quick bridge and we take our hand inside and underneath. From this position, we take a lifting action with our left hand, we take a lifting action with our right hand and we start bridging to get our partner moving like so. And now from here, we either walk, walk, walk, or we quick give a quick bridge and then we pendulum out into this position here. We go in and we post a tricep, we post a tricep. And now we either walk, walk, walk, she goes to face me, we bring knee elbow connected, or we just take knees to chest. And now she goes to face me, we just invert ourselves, put our partner back in front of us and now we can go in and put our partner back in guard. Now the one thing that's going to screw this up is if my partner changes her hand position or she has an underhook, but she switches to a cross shoulder post. So one thing that's going to mess me up from here is if I get my hands in position, but my partner takes a cross face out and she uses a cross shoulder post, where now from here as I go, it's going to be hard to clear my partner's forearm. Before it was a pretty easy thing, even if I had the outside hand position, it's a pretty easy thing to look away from my partner and to bridge and slip the cross face off. But now she has a forearm in front and across my shoulder line. So now I'm going to start bridging and moving. I try to take my partner forward, but I just shoved my partner's forearm into my throat. So as I bridge, you start getting things like this happening. And if I look toward my partner, it gets worse. If I look away from my partner, it gets worse. And you feel like you can never really clear your jaw inside and underneath that forearm. So what am I going to do here? Understand that when this happens, this is a great way for her to shut down your nearside underhook escape. Okay? Well, normally what's going to happen is she'll put this cross shoulder post in and she'll run towards your hips. And then this happens and you lose everything falls apart from there. So understand you can't go in that direction, but it's pretty easy thing to misdirect now. Yes, she shut down your initial escape, but she also unlocked their hands, which means she has far less control over my head from this position. So from here, I take my right hand inside. Even if my right hand is outside and I start this escape and let's say I couldn't get my right hand to the inside position. Even if my hands on the outside position, because she has unlocked hands, she has, she can do nothing from stopping me from just pummeling my hand inside. She can have knee or ear and shoulder connection. It means nothing. I start the escape and now when she has to stop me from taking the hand inside, I just pummel in front because she has no ability to pull herself close to me and stop me from pummeling the hand in. Now I use a cross shoulder post like so, and I start stripping out and away from my partner. I do so just so that I can get my left hand through like so, and I come through and I put my hand, my own head here with this backhand frame. She will inevitably try to switch her grips back to a top head and arm and cross face me. And when I see that, we just go in, we place our hands in an inside bicep top. When she goes to start moving towards me, we just take our right foot on the floor and we just shrimp away and invert that left knee. And now from here, when she has to reconnect their hands, I have too much inside position. Even if she gets them connected, it means nothing. We can separate them. They can bring everything back inside and we can easily recover. So when I see I'm being shut down, I get my hands into position and my partner does a good job of recognizing where I'm looking to go from here. If she keeps a cross face in place, it's a pretty easy thing to start moving out in the way. She switches her grips and now there's a form right in my throat. So if I try to bridge my partner forward towards my shoulders, you're just going to push a form deeper into your throat. It's going to be uncomfortable and everything's going to fall apart from here. So the second I see this, my right hand comes into a cross shoulder post like so. From here, I look to start immediately shrimping out in a way and taking my left hand back inside. If my partner is putting so much pressure on me that I can't take my left hand back inside, just bridge and make space. My hand will always come in. And now from here, I just take my hand right to my own head. From here, if she doesn't do anything, I just move away. So what she's always going to try to do is put a collar tie or cross face in, depending on the range she's at. The second I see that hand come across for either a collar tie or a cross face, we switch to an inside bicep top. So she has a hand in place. As she goes to switch, we're here. Now when she goes to make that connection once again, we can easily form a side guard. We can insert everything, bring everything back to the inside position, and we're fighting a winning battle from there. So whenever I see she shuts down my initial escape, just go into a misdirection. Instead of going for your initial escape and hammering away and just driving your partner's form into your throat, take everything back inside and understand that yes, she shut down the initial escape, the initial spin out, but she unlocked her hands, which means she has far less control of your head and shoulders, and you can easily bring everything back inside, stop her from reconnecting the hands, and then bring knees and feet back to the inside position. All right, so sticking with this top head and arm, we're going to go into other upper body variations now. But one common thing that you see when you start either trying to punch an underhooks or you start trying to play a side guard, specifically in most cases playing a side guard, what your partner starts to do is they start to crowd your hips. All right, now this is a great thing for them to do for a couple of reasons. If she's down in side control, if I feel my partner's trying to punch an underhook in on the far side like so, and I go in and I crowd my partner's hips, even if she gets an underhook in place, it's going to be hard for her to use that underhook. If I'm crowding the head, she can easily bump me forward and start to give me problems. If my partner gets a near side underhook and goes to spin out and I crowd the hips, it's going to be hard for her to use that underhook. So it's harder for your partner to use underhooks when she's in bottom position if I crowd the hips. And most importantly, when I crowd the hips, I point my partner's knees away from me. One of the best escapes she can use when she's in bottom position is to point the knees towards me and form a side guard. This is like the number one escape we're going to use from here. So when you're dealing with a side guard specialist and someone who's great at fighting back to inside position, and you see that the knees and elbows are coming inside and the knee is connected to your hip, you're like, oh man, she's just one step away from getting to a side guard and recovering. What people will often do is they'll circle towards the hips by going knee to knee and then driving a knee across to the far hip like so and playing a game where they constantly circle towards the hips. So you're trying to lock side guard and I crowd the hips in this direction. And then you think to yourself, well, okay, this is not good. I can't lock side guard. You get a punch in a near side underhook. And from here, you get a spin out and you can't spin out. You're like, well, that's not good. You get a punch in a far side underhook and it's hard to even get it in. And now I come in and I start putting a cross shoulder post in place. And from here, you try to bring everything back inside and recover, but your knees can't point towards me. So even if you go inside bicep tie from here and you go cross shoulder post, as you go to start scooting away from me and bringing a side guard in, even if I don't have control of your head, I'm crowding the hips so much that you can't put a side guard in place anyways. So this is a great way for the top player to shut down the previous escapes to be looked at. Okay. So it's a great thing for her to do where she starts pointing the knees away from me and all the previous escapes that we looked at involved that involved bringing the knees towards my partner. You cannot use now. Okay. They're null and void and you have to go into something else. So whenever I see someone circling towards my hips, we have to start thinking about escapes that generally start in the opposite direction. Instead of pointing my knees towards my partner and escaping and turning everything towards my partner, we're going to start the escape by moving away from my partner first and then coming back in after the initial Kazushi and pointing your knees towards our partner to recover. So let's look at those now. All right. So this time my partner is going to circle towards my hips. Okay. So understand that you're fighting a losing battle if you're trying to shrimp away and point your knees towards your partner. The escapes now have to start where you're moving away from your partner and you're turning your back to your partner to some degree and then after the initial Kazushi, you can bring your knees to point towards your partner once again. So she's going to be in side control. She's going to have a top head and arm, okay, sticking with this top head and arm thing here and she's going to circle towards my legs and she's going to shelf my legs like so. Okay. When I see this, just rotate a little bit. When I see this, understand that again, we're not going to be shrimping and pointing our knees towards our partner. So the first thing you have to understand is that because your partner is crowding your hips, you will no longer have an issue of inserting your hands inside of the upper body. Okay. Because she's moving so far away, she has no ability to stop me from inserting my right hand or my left hand. If she's crowding my head now, she can turn your strong chin to shoulder connection and ear to shoulder connection and now she can give me problems inserting that, uh, that left hand. If she's circling towards my hips now, there's so much distance between her chin and my shoulder that I can always pummel a hand to the inside. I can always pummel a hand inside my partner's, uh, my partner's knee from here. So there's no problem fighting to the inside position. The problem is I can't use these posts and these frames effectively. So from here, I'm going to pummel one hand to the inside like so, and I'm going to take a tricep post on our partner like so. Now concave shoulders are super, super important from here. If I try to attempt this move and my shoulders stay square and my jaw is exposed, you're never going to be able to hit this move. So what I'm going to look to do from here is I'm going to look to take my legs up towards my partner's hips and then down in a pendulum out in this direction. I go up and you can use this in succession with one another where I go one, two, and I create momentum. And then from here, as I get ready to go, I pendulum my legs out to the side. And from here, I concave my shoulders and I just wipe my partner's arm on bot. And now she has no control over my head from here. Okay. So what we're going to look to do is we're going to pendulum one, two, three, four. If your partner knows what's going on at any point, she circles back towards your head. I have everything back. I have my frames inside. And now from here, we can start playing a game where you go back to side guard or whatever you want from there. So she stays towards my legs and I start this pendulum game. When I'm ready to go, my shoulders go from this fully extended convex position to a fully concave position like so. Where now I punch the hand through and now I immediately build up to an elbow. I flare my hand and I move up to a hand like so. And now I just take two feet in towards my butt. When she goes to recover, I just shrimp out and away. And now we can put our partner back into any form of open guard. So very basic. I see my partner is crowding my hips. From this position, we take hand inside. We take a hand here to our partner's tricep. Now we start playing a game where we pendulum. One, two, three. Our shoulders stay relatively square. When I'm ready to go, I hide my jaw from the cross face and we move into a situation where my right shoulder moves over my left shoulder here. And I'm concave into a situation like so. That her cross face now slips on by and is forced to post on the ground. So when she goes to lock up tight. Now from here, we immediately build up to an elbow. We build up to a hand. When she goes to follow me, you just shrimp out and away. Now we're ready to go back into all of our offense. All right. So let's look at a tricep post into a side guard. Sometimes we feel like that when we go into a tricep post, our partner, maybe we can't sit all the way up to a hand or maybe our partner is running around and exposing our back and we feel like continually turning away from our partner just isn't the best option. So maybe we get into a situation where we sit up, we get our partner's hand across like this and as we try to regard my partner, my partner quickly pops up to her feet and she starts running around behind me. I'm like, Oh, if I stay here now, my back's exposed and that a pin escape turned into a back take and now I'm going to get strangled. So whenever I see that I don't want to continually turn my back away from my partner and maybe I see my partner circling towards my shoulders more faster than I want her to. Whenever I see this, go back. Whenever I see this, I'm just going to fall back down to my back and I'm just going to bring my hands in close like so. So as my partner goes to start chasing my shoulders, we just fall into a situation like so and now as my partner goes to come on to me, it's a pretty easy thing to play in a variety of different ways. As my partner goes to come on to me, I can put my left hand on my shoulder or on my chest rather and as she goes to come forwards onto me, I can punch an underhook in and now we can play a game or we lean our partner forward and we go into our underhook game. We can start to play a game where our hands come in like so. As she goes to come towards me, she goes to circle towards my shoulders. We take a near side underhook and we bite our partner through and from here we come in and we spin on through. We can play a game where we take everything inside like so and as she goes to start coming on to me, we just go in, we deny our partner chest to chest contact with head and shoulder control and from here we come in and we take everything back to the inside position and we recover. So we fall back down to our back and we just take our hands in like so with our elbows connected as best as we can over our chest and this allows me to go into a variety of recovery options. So she's circling towards my hips, circling towards my hips and from here we come out and we tricep post and we get the arm through. As we get us set up, my partner starts running towards my shoulders and I feel like, oh, this is no good. We just take everything back inside like so and now from here, if my partner stays in this position, we can punch a far side underhook in. If she circles towards my shoulders, we punch a near side underhook in. If she stays in this position or she moves in any given direction and I want to just bring my knees back inside, we take the knees back to the inside position because my partner has no control over my head and shoulders. She has no chest to chest contact and she has no inside real estate. So whenever I see I try to sit up and things are going south, maybe I'm just not comfortable. My partner is circling towards my shoulders a bit too quickly maybe. I just fall back down to this position because I dominate the upper body inside position, I can go in a variety of ways. If my partner is down by my hips, I can go far side underhook and bump her forward. If she circles towards my head, we can go far side underhook or near side underhook. If I feel like my partner is standing right in front of me, we can bring everything back inside. So we have a bunch of different options with that upper body inside position. Probably the easiest one and the one that you're going to find most often is one where I just bring knees and elbows back to the inside. Where I start here and as she has to come towards me, we just go in and we just bring everything back to the inside. The ones where you extend underhooks potentially can give you more offense but you're also extending yourself so there is more risk. So the most conservative one is just to bring everything back inside and put your partner back in front of you. I can go in for things where I go in and I punch underhooks in and I start bumping my partner forward but understand there are triangles, there are DARS counters, there are front headlock counters that your partner can start to attempt from here. So I start coming in like so and rolling my partner through. There are situations where my partner can start taking arms around, trapping me in north south and then going in and pinning me from this position where I could have had an easy pin escape just bringing everything back inside and then I get pinned to north south. So those are a little bit more risky and this is a little bit more conservative, straightforward and I bring everything back inside and now my partner has no chance of any counter attacks minus maybe falling back on my legs if I extend my legs naively. But this is the most conservative and most common one you're going to see. So I start with the tricep post turning away from my partner, I feel her circling maybe too quickly towards my shoulders and then I misdirect back in the opposite direction and I just bring everything inside and we have a variety of different escapes off of that inside position with the upper body. Alright so when we initially turn away from our partner with the tricep post and then we turn back into them, bringing everything inside and re-guarding is a pretty conservative way to work. Now if we want to go into attacks on our partner, yes whenever you go into counter attacks there is more exposure and it's more risky but you have a lot more reward associated with it where you can either sweep your partner or take their back or end up in some kind of offensive cycle. So you have to weigh your options and plan accordingly. Now when we look to start turning back into our partner from this initial tricep post, we're going to take our partner into a situation like so and now instead of just falling back down to our back and moving into situations where we can re-guard, instead this time I'm going to look to start turning towards my partner and instead of going down I'm going to come forward towards my partner and I'm going to take an over back grip like so. So right now I'm posted on my left hand and elbow, I'm going to switch from a left hand post to an over back grip and a right elbow post like so. So now from here we're going to engage in a very interesting battle. My partner's number one attack from here will be to posture up, to reach back with her left hand and to cross face me, to use that cross face to flatten me out and now from here return my back to the floor and gain head height once again. So the first thing I'm looking to do as soon as I get to this over back grip is I'm looking to put my elbow at the long end of the lever up by my partner's shoulder line. The closer my elbow is to my partner's hips the less ability I have to put her hands on the floor. So I take a grip up high like so and I place my elbow right at the base of my partner's neck. Every time my partner goes to take her left hand off the floor I just close my elbow down and over my partner's left shoulder. As she goes to cross face me she can never get the hand off the floor. I can't explain how important this is. If your partner can take the hand off the floor and then reach back cross face this is going to be bad news for you. So the second I see this I immediately put weight over my partner's hand like so. Once she goes to start cross facing me from here it's a difficult thing. Now I'm going to look to start taking my feet in towards my butt and I'm going to start bridging into my partner like I want to knock her over. My partner here will have to spread her knees and move back and away from me to not fall over. If she stays in this exact position I just build to a hand and I just bump my partner forward and she falls over to a hip. What she's going to have to do is she's going to have to base out and create a separation between her knees and my body like so. The second I see this I take my right knee and I slide it into my partner's hip. I slide my right knee into my partner's hip like so. Again when she goes to posture I put weight on my partner's hands. Now there's just so many different ways that we can go from here. One of my favorite from here is just to insert a second butterfly hook and now I just go in I grab my partner's hamstring and I start putting weight forward towards my partner's hands and I just take a leg out. And now from here we're in crotch lock territory where we can start coming in taking our partners back into cross body ride. We can start going in grabbing the far waist, the far hip, and heisting up the top position going into a turtle tax. There's many things that we can do from there. Okay. But it all starts with that initial tricep post to get my partner out and away. So she's a top head and arm. She crowds my hips. From here we go in, we pendulum, we tricep post to get our partner moving out and away and we build up like so. Now my partner's trying to run towards my shoulders and flatten me out instead or expose my back. Instead of falling back down to my back I just move from one side she has to start moving to the other. And now from here I put a wedge over my partner's upper back. When she goes to cross face me it's a difficult thing from here. So from here my two feet come in and I start building up to a hand. I flare my hand out. I build up to a hand and I start heisting into my partner like I want to knock her over. If she stays in this position she's going to fall over. So what she has to do is she has to start putting tension through the body. She has to move her legs out and away, widen her knees to stop me from knocking her over. From here I just take my left foot in. I take my right knee through. And now I'm in a situation where I have a butterfly guard but my partner's elbows are passed across by center lock. So when she has to start working from here it's the easiest thing in the world to start moving into situations where I can move into various attacks. One of the best being moving to a crotch lock scenario where from here we can start putting our partner's hands on the floor, building up, moving into thigh prize, knocking your partner down, and working from here to go into our various turtle breakdowns. So this is a great option. A little bit more risky because if my partner does reach back and cross faces me, now she's cross faced me, I'm flattened out, I'm back in a pin and my arm is potentially stuck across my body. So that's no good. But if you do actually make it work you most likely have your partner's back. So using a tricep post you start by turning away from your partner, you misdirect and use an over back grip to start hitting kazushis, getting your knees back inside, and then creating some kind of offense. All right, now let's look at what we do if our partner does reach back and put a cross face in, how we can regard as she goes to put a cross face in when the over back grip fails. All right, so now let's look at a situation where we have this over back position and our partner reaches back and goes into a cross face. A couple of good options that we can look at from here. All right, the first is going to be one where we can move into submissions, which is always our favorite, where my partner goes to reach back and the first thing I have to look at is obviously I'm trying to put weight on my partner's hand. Now if I feel like I can't keep weight on the hand and she reaches back, what I can't do is just have my head dangling out here for a deep cross face to come in underneath my jaw and she starts to cross face me. All right, so I'm always able to hide my jaw from the cross face the best I can by turning my shoulder like so and blading my shoulder forward so that when she goes to cross face me she hits my shoulder first and then she slides off and the cross face now is up by my orbital bone in my eye socket rather than deep and underneath my jaw. Okay, so the first thing is I move into this position here and I have my hand ready to intercept her cross face. So when she goes to take the cross face through, we go in and we intercept the hand as it comes by and we grab the wrist. Now it's a pretty common thing to come through with the hand and punch to kimura. Now two great options. One if I can put the hand behind the back, which I commonly can, I don't care how strong, how athletic your partner is, if you put the hand behind the back there's two options. She's going to roll through or she's going to get broken. Okay, if I feel like I can't put the hand behind the back, all right, and she puts the hand inside like so, from here I use a pendulum motion to start moving out and away from my partner. Okay, so from this position I pendulum up into one direction and now I just pendulum all the way out and around. If I feel my partner has an elbow behind my waist, if I can't pendulum through, I just place a foot on the floor, I insert a knee and now I bring my knees inside and now we can play a traditional kimura game where we cast the leg up and over the head and we have tons of options from here. Normally in the heat of the moment, your partner will be trying to posture up and away from you to pull the kimura out. So whenever I see this, we just use the legs to pendulum up towards our partner's hips, we whip our body around in this direction and then we create an angle where we can whip our partner down into a chi kimura and start playing with kimuras from there. So from here, I first try to keep weight on the hands, that fails. She goes to cross face me, I hide the jaw from the cross face and we go and we intercept with the bottom hand. We reach through, we lock kimura and we immediately put it behind the back. If we can put it behind the back, we can always break our partner from here, she stays in this position or we can roll our partner through. If she puts the hand inside the hip and she covers my hips, I just place the knee inside, second knee comes inside and then we start going into all of our kimura series from here. More than likely, I lock the kimura, she tries to pull the arm out and as I see that, we just tuck everything inside, we pendulum from one hip to the other and we sit our partner down into a chi kimura. This time, my partner goes to reach through and I feel like a kimura is not there maybe, maybe I've locked a kimura before and she's greased and she pulled the arm out, I just want to go into a guard recovery. Whatever the case is, kimura is not your thing and you want to just recover guard. She goes to put the cross face in, from here I shield myself from a deep cross face and we intercept with the hand like so. Now as I go to fall down to my back, my partner will be driving me down to my back, I take my elbow inside my partner's hip like so and now as she goes to come forwards, I go in and I put a cross shoulder post in place. Now I'll only be able to control my partner's wrist for so long, she's going to pommel through. As she goes to pommel through, I switch up higher towards the shoulder so that it's much harder for her to pommel the bicep than it is the wrist and the hand and I switch to an inside bicep tie instead. Now when she goes to come forwards into me, I just plant my foot on the floor, I scoot out and away, I kick my leg and I have a knee inside and we can easily lock a side guard and deny our partner control of the head and shoulders. So from here, we have this over back grip, she goes to reach around, we intercept it with the hand and we catch like so. Now from here, we use this to slow our partner down as we insert the left elbow inside and we move into a cross shoulder post like so. My partner goes to come forward and we deny her the ability to get chest to chest. We deny her the ability to get a top head and arm, to get any control of my head and now from here, when she goes to start controlling me, it's a pretty easy thing to go in and insert my elbows back to the inside, my knees and elbows back to the inside and recover our guard from there. There is another option that we can look at now where instead of using our bottom hand to intercept our partner's cross face, we can use the top hand to intercept our partner's cross face. This time, as my partner goes to reach around and cross face me, we're just going to hide ourselves from the cross face and as she comes through, our over back grip switches to a grip here where we just catch our partner's hand and wrist and we intercept our partner like so. Now this is an escape I use generally when my partner is controlling my hips in the correct fashion. If I go, if I use my bottom hand to intercept my partner's wrist like so and I move to this cross shoulder post, it can be hard from here to stoot away from your partner. Your partner can use a tight waist to come forward and pull you in and drag you in and then you try to stoot away from your partner and it can be a difficult thing from here. So generally, when I see my partner going to control my hips with this tight waist, she's pulling the elbow in and she goes to start reaching around, I go in and I either one, I catch with my bottom hand first and then I pass it off or two, if it's in the correct position, I just catch with my left hand like so. And now, because I have control over my partner's cross face arm with my top hand, I can use my bottom hand freely. If I go to a cross shoulder post like so, I have to use my bottom hand to stop my partner from cross facing me. Now if I don't do anything with this bottom hand, she comes forward and she cross faces me or takes a call tie and she pulls herself in chest to chest. Whereas if I'm here, when she goes to cross face me now, she can't cross face me. So now I can use my bottom hand and elbow freely. So she covers my hips, she takes a deep tight waist perhaps. So now from here, if I start trying to move away from my partner along the mat, it's difficult. If I use the previous strips and I try to start moving away from my partner along the mat, it's difficult. She follows me with the hips. So from this position, I'm going to fall down to my right shoulder and I'm going to look to start bringing my hips up like so. So I just use my toes to walk my hips off the ground and I turn my hips up towards the ceiling. This weakens the bite my partner has on the tight waist. And now from here, when she goes to cross face me, she can't. And now when she goes to follow me, I just walk away and I bring my knees back inside where they can easily recover. So in general, when I see my partner has minimal control over my hips, I use a bottom hand interception. Okay. So from here, we catch, we bring everything back inside to a cross shoulder. And when she goes to cover, she has no control over my hips so I can bring my knees back inside. If my partner, however, has a strong tight waist in place and I try to recover with the bottom hand interception and I go to fall down like so, you can find yourself in a position where you have the upper body inside position, but the tight waist will not allow you to scoot away and lock a side guard. So you kind of get into this stalemate where it's hard for your partner to actually get control of you, but it's hard for you to recover. And if you lose the upper body pummeling battle, now you're back to square one. All right. So whenever I see my partner has a strong tight waist and she has to reach back, I intercept one top hand or bottom hand, and then I make a pass off like so. Now I have a cross wrist. So from here I can fall down to my shoulders, my shoulder like so. Now when she goes to hold onto that tight waist by turning my right hip up towards the ceiling, that weakens the lock of the tight waist. So as she goes to start following me and pulling me in with a tight waist, I just walk out and away and I bring my knee inside. Once I have knee and elbow connection, when she goes to pummel, it's a pretty easy thing to take everything back inside and play a game from inside position. So when I see my partner is doing a really great job, actually let's do this angle, doing a really great job of covering my hips from this position, I use a top hand interception. So I either go one top hand right away or I use a bottom hand first and then I make a pass off. If I fall down, you see how her hand is completely covered by my body. She's a very strong and very deep tight waist from this position. So if I try to use the bottom hand method and just shrimp along the mat, it's difficult to expose and weaken that tight waist. So I take this cross wrist here. So now when she goes to take that tight waist, notice when I start bridging, her hand now is exposed to you guys. The tightness of the lock is severely compromised. If she tries to jump across my body, I just open up my legs. There's no back exposure here. So from here, when she gets to pull me in, I just walk, walk, walk, and then I slide the knee in, I go knee to elbow, she goes to come forward, and now we use that cross shoulder and inside bicep tie to easily recoil. So the general rule when I see my partner reach back for a cross face, if I see there's minimal control over the hips, I use a bottom hand interception. If I see there's a strong tight waist and she has good control over my hips, I generally use a top hand interception where I can use a cross wrist grab to start raising my hips to weaken the tight waist, walking away, and then switching back to your traditional cross shoulder and inside bicep tie. So let's look at sidekipping from this side control escape where my opponent covers my hips. She grabs my hips, and from here we're going to look to go into that same series we looked at before where we pendulum from side to side. Although this time, we're not going to fully sit up to a tricep post. We're just going to start penduluming them side to side. And then what's going to actually unlock my partner's hands if she's relatively talented and has a good base? The pendulum enough sometimes won't be enough to unlock my partner's hands and get her off balance. But the kipping, the shake, shake, shake, will put her right over the edge and force her to unlock her hands and post either the cross face hand or the under hook hand. So first, we're going to look at sidekipping. And we're going to look at this in a mounted position as well, but there are applications we're going to look at right now. We pendulum side to side like so. We start getting our partner off balance. And now a lot of times, just the pendulum itself won't be enough to separate my partner's hands. So from here, I pendulum out to a side. And now as I start to go, I just kip, kip, kip, kip, kip. And that's won't be enough to separate my partner's hands. So she crowds my hips, so I can't face my knees towards her. She circles all the way towards my hips. And from here, I find myself in a situation where I'm not going to be able to point my knees towards her. So we go in one, two, three, four, kip, kip, kip, kip, kip. And we get a hand posted out on the ground. Whether it be my partner's cross face hand or my partner's under hook hand, we have recoveries for both. But a lot of times, including with the tricep post, I'll pendulum and we'll almost get our partner's hands unlocked. We'll pendulum, pendulum, pendulum, but the hands will stay connected. And I'll get my partner right to the tipping point, but not off balance enough to post the hand. So from here, we go in one, two, three. She goes to keep her hands locked. And the kip will either, one, be so much of an off balance, where if she does keep her hands locked, she actually falls over. So she keeps her hands locked from here. She circles towards my hips. You can actually take your partner over and roll them through. What's always going to happen is no one's going to fall over. They're going to post one of the two hands, whether it be the cross face, like so, or whether it be the under hook, like so. And we have different recoveries based on which partner, well, which hand our partner posts. So now let's look at a situation where we go to hit the side kip, and my partner takes a cross face hand out and posts on the floor. Now understand you can obviously go into a full tricep post and sit up to your elbow and recover like that. But there are other recoveries that we can do without going into a full tricep post and sitting all the way up to our hand. So we come in and we go out and we pendulum, pendulum, pendulum, and we get our partner's cross face hand posted out like so. When I see this, my partner's always going to be looking to take the cross face hand back and around and put her cross face back in. So obviously you have all of your sitting up situations where you can go in and tricep post and go into the same series we looked at before. Another great option from here is just to take a post on my partner's tricep with the opposite hand. So we take a false grip over my partner's tricep like so, and from here we take our right elbow inside. Again because my partner's so far towards my hips, it's the easiest thing in the world to take my right hand to the inside position. And now from here, my partner goes to start reaching into that cross face position. It's a difficult thing. Now I play a game where I have a couple of good options from here. If I feel my partner has limited control of my hips, it's a pretty easy thing from here to just post my left foot, start walking away, and bring my right elbow to the inside position. And now from here I can easily bring my left knee in, or I can go into any kind of regard, or because my partner's arms are out and out of position, I can put her hands on the floor, I can scoop the legs, I can go into leg entrances, I can do a ton of things from here. My first great option is from here, I get that hand posted like so, and we put a false grip over our partner's tricep. From here, we put an elbow inside. If I feel like there's minimal control over my hips, then we just immediately place the foot on the floor, we start kipping, kipping, kipping, kipping, kipping, kipping, as we shrimp away, and now from here we can, the bare minimum, regard and possibly go into counter attacks on our partner's legs, which is the most, the easiest thing to do from here because of my partner's hand position. If on the other hand, I see that I get to this position and I can't shrimp away, my partner's pulling the elbow in tight to my hip, and I just can't shrimp away, whenever I see this, I just shoot from a post on my partner's tricep like so, I take my hand out from the hip, and I shoot my hand, my elbow outside my partner's knee, and I just quickly sit up to an overback grip. So I take my left foot on the floor, and I use that to just start bridging towards my partner, and I use it as a drive leg, and I sit to this overback grip like so, and now we start playing the overback game where we can start building up and either picking our partner's back or she reaches back for a cross face and we go into our game that we play here, okay? So whenever we see, we use this side kipping motion to get our partner's cross face hand posted, we have our classic tricep post where we sit up and sit out. We have a situation where we want to recover guard, so we switch to a tricep post so my partner can't put the cross face back in. Doesn't seem like much, but it's very robust. When she has to reach back, I can always follow my partner from here. If I feel like there's minimal control over my hips, I put an elbow inside my partner's hip, I just scoot, scoot, scoot, and knee and elbow connect. Now from here she goes to move, I can re-guard and go into counterattacks as we looked at before. This time, I see for whatever reason, my partner has such good control over my hips. She's pulling her elbow in, she's driving her knee into my hip, and I feel like I'm trying to scoot away, I just can't do it. Whenever I see that, I just play it. My outside foot on the floor, I just drive into my partner and I sit up to my right elbow like so. She goes to cross face me, I put her hand on the floor. And now from here we play this over back game, whatever it may be, and we go into attacking options from there. This time we go into a sidekip, and instead of relinquishing the cross face grip, my partner posts with the underhook hand instead. So we go into a situation where we're at bottom side control, we go into the sidekip, my partner keeps the cross face, but she posts the underhook hand like so. Understand that because the hands are unlocked, if you want to, it's usually a pretty easy thing to clear the hand through if you want to do that, and clear the cross face as well. There's always going to be a time though where you have someone who's just uber strong who moves to a shallow collar tie and tucks the elbow, and I try to push it across and I just can't quite clear it. Whenever I see this, I just take a hand inside my partner's shoulder like so, and I place my hand here on my own head as a backhand frame. From this position, we just take a V grip on our partner's elbow, and we look to start elongating our partner's arm out and away. And from here, we just slip the knee to the inside position and we grab over our partner's tricep like so. Now when she goes to maintain a pin, it's a pretty easy thing to start taking my right foot to the floor and just shrimping. One, two, three, and moving out and away from my partner. Now from here, she can't cross face me because of the fact that I have a backhand frame in and I'm touching my own head. When she goes to put a legitimate collar tie in place, I can easily strip the grip. I can switch to inside bicep ties if she moves her hand at all, and I can strip grips off. Okay, so I have this backhand frame keeping me safe. Now it's going to be difficult for me to insert my right knee inside of her hip a lot of times. So if I see the knee can't come inside the hip and connect to my elbow, I just take my knee and I insert it right inside my partner's armpit like so. So now once she goes to maintain a top pin, I just take the knee inside the armpit, my knee and elbow joint together, and now from here we can go in and make a full recovery. So this time I see my partner circles towards my hips, I go into the side kipping motion where I pendulum, pendulum, pendulum, and my partner posts the underhook hand. Usually most of the time I can clear this grip off. If I can't or if I just don't want to, whatever the case is, we just palm of the hand inside and we just touch her own forehead like so. From here we put a grip in like so. If I see my partner's arm come towards me and she gets to put the underhook back in, I can skip going to the V grip and I can just use this to bring my knee inside. So depending on the range of your partner's arm, it will depend on what grip you use. If the arm is far away and my forearm can't reach, I use a forehand frame. But from here I just slip inside and I convert to a forearm frame. If I see the underhook is coming towards me, I just tuck my elbow on the inside position relative to hers. And now from here I just use an opening of my elbow to get my knee to the inside position. Now she goes to start covering, I just walk into a situation like so. If I can bring my knee inside the hip, great. A lot of times from here you won't be able to. If I just take my two knees together and I insert my right knee inside my partner's armpit, I take my knee up to my elbow and now as she goes to come towards me, it's a difficult thing and we can easily recover. So one more time. She has me flattened out. We bring everything inside, we pendulum, we get the hand posted. From here she goes to make the recovery. Go ahead. And now we're back inside, everything's ready to go and we can go into all of our counter offense that we talked about previously. So this time she posts the underhook hand and we make the necessary adjustments to bring first the outside knee in and then the inside knee once we can make, generate some space between myself and my partner.
