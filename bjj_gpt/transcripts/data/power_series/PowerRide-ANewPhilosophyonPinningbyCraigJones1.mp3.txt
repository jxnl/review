 I trained Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for many years and I believed that I could really control a man. But after my first stint in prison, I realized I didn't even know how to hold a man down. Did you a fat, out of shape, old professor tell you that these positions were good positions? Side control is junk. Mount is junk. Back control, junk. I'm going to teach you the real way to control a bottom man. You're going to learn the skills of splitting the legs, riding the legs, turking the legs, shelving the legs. You're going to learn the upper body controls, a cross face, a claw, open elbows, dagger standing handcuffs, half Nelson, and rear naked control. Remember, your coaches don't know how to control a man because they don't know how to ride a man. Alright guys, let's talk about the origins of the point scoring system. We can use the IBJJF for example. We need to start thinking about why do we get points for certain positions or why are we rewarded for guard passes. You might not have even thought about it. I've been in the sport for a long time. It took me a long time to really try to think about why do we reward certain positions with a certain amount of points versus other positions with less. Why do we not reward certain positions? And again, why do we reward people for passing the guard? If I pass someone's guard to side control, obviously we're going to get passing points. Well, those point scoring positions were developed because they thought they were strong ground and pound positions. So obviously we took away ground and pound and we just have a non-striking, essentially a non-combat in a way sport. But the positions origins and the reason we score those positions for points were because they were good ground and pound positions. So I want you to remember that. Think about that as the origins. This instruction is going to have nothing to do with ground and pound. This instruction will be about controlling the bottom player. But if we look at it, all right, so we reward someone for a guard pass. We reward someone obviously for mount. We reward someone for back points. But we obviously reward someone for knee ride as well. How often do you see a modern day MMA fight finish from side control? How often do you see a modern day MMA fighter get finished with ground and pound from knee ride? Even mount is very, very difficult. I would say generally speaking, in most MMA fights, unless someone was rocked on the way down, you very rarely see a guy just get straight up finished with ground and pound. And if we look at who the best, most effective grapplers at combining strikes on the ground with control, it would be guys like Khabib. And Khabib really doesn't try to pass people's guards. How often do you see Khabib in side control? Khabib will remain on top of the legs. He'll remain in a closed guard or a half guard. If you talk to guys like that, even Randy Couture would say back in the day that his preferred position to strike from was half guard. And you've got to ask yourself, if our point scoring system in the sport was built around ground and pound positions, then why are those positions so terrible in modern day MMA for ground and pound? And it's got to do with control. You'll see a classic example in recent memory would be Israel Adesanya versus Jan Blachowicz. A lot of people attacked Israel in this fight because when he was on bottom and he was in bottom half guard, he left his legs open and Jan wouldn't pass half guard. And all of the Jiu Jitsu purists, all of these guys out there were looking at that and obviously the first thing they did was criticize Izzy. They were like, this guy doesn't even know to keep his legs closed in half guard. And no one stepped back to think, obviously the UFC champion does know how to play half guard bottom. And then you've got to ask yourself, why was Jan Blachowicz so hesitant to pass a half guard that was open? And when you step back, it's easy to, it's dismissive and it's easy to say, oh, MMA fighters don't know how to grapple, right? But when we think about half guard being a strong control position, it is because we are at least on top of one of our opponent's legs and that makes it difficult for them to get up. Other examples, Kelvin Gastelum, this guy is not even a grappler. That's not his strength. His strength is boxing. And what he quite often does is he lets people pass because from side control, he has a great ability to turtle away and shake people off. He can move in multiple directions. If he's in half guard, he has to come up through his opponent. If his opponent passes his guard to side control, he can come through his opponent or he can turtle away. You got guys like Derrick Lewis. Derrick Lewis' philosophy is just get up, just stand up. And that's actually surprisingly effective. And that is because in my opinion, side control is not a great control position. And for that matter, if you try to ground and pound from side control, you're likely to leave space. And you probably find the same thing in Jiu-Jitsu. We instinctually want to pass guards to side control because it's a point scoring position. We get points for passing the guard to that position. But quite often what happens, and you'll see this in many high level matches, is someone will pass someone's guard to side control just long enough to score and then the bottom guy will get his guard back immediately. Obviously, there's a couple of different ways that this could happen. Obviously, the top guy might not actually be too good at holding the position. The guy gets his guard back. But generally speaking, I think side control, while you're committed to the pin, is an effective position for the top player. But the second they choose to do something else, look for a pass to knee right, or come up to knee right because obviously you're going to score more points, look for a submission. Usually space opens up and the bottom guy can start to get their guard back. And think about it the same way in MMA. You get to side control. Obviously, we don't step over arms into some sort of crucifix style position. If you just try to strike from side control, you're likely to leave space and your opponent is going to escape. And for that reason is why a lot of guys do not elect to take side control when it's there. We're looking at it through two different lenses. Jiu-Jitsu is very forgiving. Obviously, if you're trying to pass someone's guard and you get flipped over, or if you pass someone's guard and go for a submission, or even if you pass someone's guard and just get straight up reversed, IBJJF won't even score that points for the bottom guy because in their mind you've passed their legs. But really, there should be no situation where you're happy to reverse the position from top side control or even top mount with a bridging roll or something like that. That should score something because obviously you've gone from a dominant position to a non-dominant position. The reason we see less of that in MMA is because there's much greater risk. They're not just playing for points. They're obviously trying to damage each other. So obviously, you're not going to take as many risks. So they have to have, in my opinion, superior control. And really, you see MMA fighters, they don't think about IBJJF points. If the IBJJF points scoring system was the most superior methodology to control the bottom player, we would see MMA fighters do more or less the same things we do because when the risk is higher, the game has to be sharper. So if they were super concerned with getting reversals or anything like that, they would probably, and the IBJJF points system was the best form of control, they would use it. But when you watch MMA, that's not the case. And what I'm going to argue throughout this whole instructional is that we need to take a step back and try to think about how we can control the bottom player to mitigate their ability to stand up or their ability to really be comfortable. And for our way to control them, I want you to forget completely about IBJJF points scoring systems. So I want you to stop rolling to the points. We're going to show you a ton of positions in this product that are superior control positions to what score points in the IBJJF. And if that doesn't make you a bit alarmed about the way the sport's been built, then I'm not sure really what will. Because really, our goal is control that leads to submission. We look at that statement and we assume control relates to IBJJF points scoring positions. We don't step back and think, hey, maybe the points scoring structure is a bit, it leaves a bit of stuff out. You know what I mean? And my opinion is that when they set those rules back in the nineties or potentially in the eighties, whenever they decided that was, that structured how we do jujitsu right up until today. Everyone builds their game around scoring points. That's why I mean, even this, there's not even a ton of submissions in the IBJJF because it's built around obviously points scoring. But if we forget about the points scoring and just think about the statement control, there are better positions to control the bottom player in than just those IBJJF points scoring positions. So even as say, you just watch this part of the introduction and you go to the gym to train, try to step back and think to yourself, are there sort of gray areas? And it's only a gray area because it doesn't score points. Are there gray areas where you put your training partners in that control them better than the points scoring positions? One example of that would be a stack pass. When we stack someone up there, we have excellent control. We've contorted the spine. They're uncomfortable. They're in an unathletic position, but it's not rewarded. That's not rewarded with anything. Even though you have complete control over them, you have paths straight to the back or you have paths straight to submission opportunities. Whereas if you were to stack someone and pass them to side control, held them for three seconds, controlled them, then they got their guard back. You would be rewarded with points even though you potentially sacrificed a strong control position for a point scoring position. So again, we're going to try to address some of the issues I have with the way we score points in most tournaments around the world. Again, my biggest issue throughout is going to be the idea that passing guard to side control is a really, really good thing to do. Again, I don't think that is, I think there's much superior ways to control people. Again, case in point, MMA fighters have much more to lose, their brain cells to lose. We just have our egos and they very rarely elect to pass the guard. What they elect to do is ride the legs, control the legs, and ultimately look to flatten their opponents down. I personally believe, and I have no evidence for this whatsoever, but the idea of two hooks back control being the most dominant point scoring position was historically, it was flattening your opponent down when they're belly down and you're on top. Because that's a great ground and pound position, great submission position, it contorts them and it's unathletic. But because we defined it as two hooks was point scoring by these tournaments, we then started choosing to take the back by placing ourselves underneath our opponents. So we're controlling obviously seatbelt style with our back flat to the floor, when in my opinion a better position would be obviously hooks in, boots in, flattened out. So everything we do is going to involve around riding the legs, pinning the legs, and that's the most superior form of control. And it's why in folk style wrestling they don't count a takedown until you cover the hips. There are many reasons why staying on the lower half of the body, controlling the lower half of the body is the strongest control position in just grappling broadly. Let's talk about how the bottom player can create movement, create escapes, create explosive athletic movements. And most of those movements are going to come from the legs, right? So if Tyler's on his back here, let's take a look at a couple of movements here. Let's see, watch Tyler hit a bridge. He's using his legs to create the bridge. Let's look at him hip escape. When he hip escapes, that movement fundamentally involves the legs, right? So if we're trying to imagine this, let's put it in the framework of point scoring positions. Again side control doesn't score points, but obviously 99.9% of the times you end up in side control is you've passed the guard here. So when I pass the guard on Tyler and he wants to create movement here, I'm basically trying to pin his upper body here. I can do things like use a cross face to apply pressure, control. To the best of my ability I can try to get a knee elbow connection here. But look at Tyler's legs, he can find his feet on the ground and he can explode his hips up. He can start to bridge into me, he can hip escape off of that bridge and he can start to get his legs involved. If we think about mount as well, obviously we're going to have forms of mount where we can start grapevining the legs, but for the most part we're going to have a mount where we're sitting just above the hips here. But Tyler can have his legs together, he can swing them back and forth, he can find them on the ground, he can create movements with his legs and he can make it difficult for us to control him here. So those are just two examples. Obviously we've got knee right as well. There's nothing about knee right that controls Tyler's lower half. So if we're broadly speaking about control, why are we using our upper body and our entire body weight to control our opponent's upper body and basically using our body weight to pin their upper body when the root of all their movements to escape and to explode come from the legs. If the most dangerous part of Tyler's body is his legs, why is that not the thing we focus on when we focus on control? That should be what we're targeting here. Again, this stuff is going to be stuff that you'll see in things like folk style wrestling where their goal is to get back up. Leg riding is what keeps the bottom player down. Folk style wrestling, you're not going to see side control style positions as often as leg riding positions. But again, this is going to be hard for people to grasp at this point from a pure jiu jitsu background because of basically the standard operating procedure that all gyms and all coaches around the world follow, dictated by the IBJJF point scoring system, which we've already addressed is outdated and old and doesn't really grasp the full gravity of jiu jitsu and its forms of control. Just broadly thinking, if Tyler's strongest, most dangerous part of his body to create movement is the legs and it's his ability not only to use those legs but to get his feet to the ground that allows him to lift his hips, why are we trying to pin people and why are we rewarded for pinning people by bypassing the legs, controlling the upper body? Obviously, you're probably initially thinking, well, because if we're in front of the legs, we're in a submission danger, arm bars, triangles. But there's a difference between being in front of the legs where we're in submission danger and being in point scoring positions. There's a gray area, there's an in-between and again, this is what we're going to demonstrate. It's how we can kill those legs in a safe way and by killing those legs, that's how we control movement. That's how we sort of redefine what a pin is. Obviously, in wrestling, a pin's going to be two shoulders to the mat for three seconds, going to win you the match, right? But in the context of control that leads to submission, I think a pin is when my opponent's chances of creating movement are basically zero to none. If I can control Tyler in such a way that he cannot move without conceding something else, that to me is what we should truly be aiming for when we talk about pinning our opponents. We want our opponents to feel basically helpless and very rarely to do modern grapplers with good escapes feel helpless in side control, mount, even the back. Guys have spent so much time with our traditional thought process of what back control is because of EBI. Guys, they're comfortable in all these positions. So if we can't make people uncomfortable in point scoring positions and those point scoring positions aren't consistently leading to submissions, why are we doing it the way we're doing it and why are we targeting the IBGF point scoring system and teaching grappling like that all around the world? Again, the goal is control that leads to submission and I believe that control should use the definition, my definition of what a pin is and that is they cannot move without conceding something else. Let's delve into that concept a bit more. Let's get a bit more in depth with it and we can talk about all point scoring positions as they're commonly seen today in the sport and really it all revolves around the principle of the bottom player's feet touching the floor. So again, one more time, Tyler's on his back. He can bridge if his feet are on the floor. He can hip escape if his feet are on the floor. If he tries those movements without his feet, he has no power at all. So I want you to think about that throughout. When we talk about controlling the bottom grappler, it's going to all involve preventing these feet being on the floor. We're going to have very many different ways to do that and a lot of the ways that you're going to see today, you're not going to believe are as effective as they are until you start exploring them in rolling. And I like to call it, basically you're staying in a gray area. It's a gray area only because the IBGF doesn't score it. Well, most ornaments don't score it, but it'll be superior control. So again, let's look at it from all positions, right? So we did cover how for a mount, which would score, Tyler's feet can still touch the floor. It can still create explosive movement. Knee ride can create explosive movement. Side control, he can create explosive style movements. Then when we take the back, if I have two hooks on Tyler here, my feet can't touch the floor, even if I have a body triangle here, but Tyler's feet can touch the floor and he can start bridging to us. He can basically dictate movement from such a horrible position here. So in my opinion, you don't effectively control someone unless you can mitigate their athletic movements. And you can only mitigate those athletic movements if we can keep their feet off the ground. This style of game will not replace what you already know, but it will be a great way to fatigue the guy on bottom so that by the time you get to those traditional style positions, they're so tired that they don't have athletic ability anymore. The concept will be these positions will fatigue your opponents worse than the traditional ones. We shouldn't rush past the guard to score when really what we want to do is control them, fatigue them, submit them. And again, what I'm going to show is that the traditional methodology of rushing the guard, getting as many points, scoring positions as possible, isn't really going to fatigue your opponents too much. And it's not just because they're comfortable and have a ton of escapes from those positions. It's because if they can put their feet on the floor, they can explode. Say for example, me against a guy like Nicky Rod, basically impossible to hold in side control. Knee ride, mount, basically impossible to even control him from the back in traditional sort of scope, unless of course he's tired. For a person of my size to control a person of Nicky Rod's size, I'm going to have to think outside the box and I'm going to have to think what is the core movement that generates his explosiveness. And you saw with Tyler, he can't really move if his feet aren't on the ground. That's the same no matter the size, no matter the explosiveness of your opponent. So to control bigger, stronger opponents, everyone moves the same way. We need to keep the feet off the ground. And really we don't want to start progressing and attacking submissions until they're already tired. Why fight fire with fire? If I try to arm triangle a gorilla like Nicky Rod, he's going to freak out. And really no matter how good my technique is, it's going to be tough to control. But if I've controlled him prior to those points and he's fatigued himself trying to find ways to explode when he can't because his feet are off the ground, by the time we do attack that arm triangle, it's basically technique versus technique at that point. Before we get into the way I approach pinning someone, the way I approach controlling someone, and again, control at least a submission, I'm not just trying to hold him down. Let's just talk about, again, I can't hammer this home enough. And that is the standard operating procedure of every gym around the world. And that holds true whether it's a competition gym or it's not a competition gym. Largely those gyms are not as different as you might imagine. And that is because they follow the point scoring structure. Obviously a competition gym, these guys are going to be counting points, advantages in their head. But again, they're going to be looking for largely the same stuff. A guard pass is going to be something a coach would be proud of his student doing when watching them roll, whether it's at ATOS or whether it's at a Gracie self-defense school. The way they roll largely is going to follow the same path. And again, whether it's comp focused or whether it's not comp focused. It doesn't follow the same path. Again, the Gracies use the same positional controls. And that's really, again, where the IBJF history comes from, where those points positions come from. So, what is the standard operating procedure? If I were to be in half guard and I was following a traditionalist approach, I'd be looking for cross face underhook and we'd be looking to clear and pass to side control. We'd be largely, again, this is more comp focused, they'd count three seconds in their head, whether it's not comp focused or not, they'd still follow a similar idea and that is let the position settle. And then what they would think is, oh, we want to go to knee right, one, two, three, score more points. We want to go to mount, one, two, three, we scored more points. Again, same approach, different goals, competition, traditionalist gym. Same thing from here, they'd be looking to start getting their elbows above their head, lifting this up, hoping that Tyler to defend the arm triangle starts to sit up. And that gives us an opportunity for a gift wrap. And what would the goal be when they get the gift wrap? It would be a style of back take that pulls their opponent on top of them because they want two hooks. Why do we want two hooks? We want two hooks because it scores points. And that's where everyone teaches from. So they're going to go gift wrap, they're going to pull the bottom guy on top here. And what's even funny enough is at 500F, they don't score body triangles. So these students won't even go for the body triangle first, they'll place their two hooks in, they'll count one, two, three, they'll place it back. If we're talking 80CC, they'll leave one hook in, they'll score their points, they'll take it out, they'll count, they'll put it back in, they'll score more points. So even if it's competition focused or not, they're both using all the same positions, they just sort of play the approach a bit differently. Comp schools are going to gain the system to score more points. Traditional schools, they're going to still be thinking about control, but control in the narrow confines of the positions they've been told. Neither of these gyms will largely focus on pure control. And again, you're going to see more evidence of this style of control in MMA. Khabib, Ben Askren, guys of that nature, they're controlling the bottom player, they're not taking jiu-jitsu positions. Again, watch how they fight. They take control of the bottom player in a way that makes it difficult for them to be swept, reversed, submitted, and that will play forms of control that you sort of look at and wonder how they're able to effectively hold the person down without using what we largely use, and that is that sort of standard operating procedure. So I've hammered that home enough. We're going to move on to the ideas I'm talking to you about. I've covered all the issues with the standard point scoring structure, the standard operating procedure, and now we're going to talk about how we can approach the bottom position in a way to improve our control, our pins, and ultimately our submissions. I promise you, if you control people in the ways I'm about to show, your submission rate will go up. It will look like I'm just pinning control of the bottom player, but again, the bottom guy, he can't find opportunities to escape, and he wants to win, he starts to take more risks, and risk, the bottom player taking risks is where our opportunity for submission lies.
