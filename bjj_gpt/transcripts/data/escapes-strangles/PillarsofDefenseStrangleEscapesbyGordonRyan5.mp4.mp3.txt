 Okay, dark strangles. Dark strangles are definitely an issue. One of the hardest submissions to escape. You don't really have access to your partner's hands. It's hard to expose the elbow. It's a very, very difficult thing to deal with. And it's different because with anacondas, you have direct access to the lock of your partner's arms. You can expose the elbow and pump, pump, pump to expose that elbow. But with a dars, now your elbow connects with the, on the opposite side is the locked hands. So when a dars comes through, if I try to expose her elbow, the only elbow I can use to expose her elbow is my right elbow, and it exposes the wrong elbow. I need to expose this connection. And I can't post, I can't do anything which has enough power to actually separate the hands from here. So it's very, very difficult. One thing that will keep you safe, not safe, but it will delay you getting strangled is whenever, wherever your partner's chest points, you want your chest to point in the same direction. That's so, so important. If your partner's chest points towards the floor, your chest has to point towards the floor. If your partner's chest points towards the ceiling, your chest has to point towards the ceiling. The second is a discrepancy in the direction of your partner's chest and your chest. If she goes in here, she locks up, she falls belly up, you will immediately get strangled from here. Lock up, strangle, you're immediately going to get finished. So that when my partner falls into this position, I have to fall into a belly up position. Now if she goes to strangle me, she can, but it'll be not nearly as tight. Okay? If we go belly up and then she goes belly down and I stay belly up and she goes to strangle me from here, I'm going to get finished immediately. So your chest and your partner's chest have to be pointing the same direction, whether that's up or down. And that's so, so important. That's what's going to buy you time through transition to eventually escape. Okay? Now keep that in mind as we go through this. Let's go into an early escape on our partner, just trying to lock it up by going into a forward roll. So from here, my partner's going in, she locks, she goes to lock darts and she just has a palm to palm grip at the back of my head controlled like so. The second I see this, I can immediately take my elbows back, which makes it harder for her to actually lock up. And I quickly just pop up off my knees and I just go right into a front roll over my head. And I roll all the way through and that makes it hard for my partner to follow. Okay? When she tries to follow this, my head kind of moves into a different position and it's very hard for her to try to follow me. So if she tries to follow, she locks up, right from here I immediately just pop up quick, just like so. And we just go right into a front roll. When she goes to follow, it's hard for her to follow because her hands aren't locked. And then from there we can create a situation where we move back to a neutral position or preferably go into an offensive cycle. But the second the hand comes through, immediately just pop up, gain a little bit of height with your hips, and then just go right into a front roll and use that front roll to move your head out, clear the elbow, and then go back into your attacks. Okay so now, the D'arce is something that it's... I don't really have a bulletproof escape to it. I have some things that I can do to get out, but they take time. But I do have one thing which will make it almost impossible for you to get strangled, provided you do it correctly. Now the one caveat to this is that if your partner entangles your legs, especially if they control your hips like they lock closed guard or they step over into mount, the thumb post becomes irrelevant and the mechanics are so strong that you will get strangled anyways. But the thumb post will keep you safe provided you can keep your partner's legs away from yours, from your legs and hips. Okay? So my partner goes to feed this hand through. First thing I want to do is I want to catch the wrist like so. So when I catch the wrist, I make space for my thumb and my jaw, right at my jaw line, to meet. And that will cover the space where my partner's arm is trying to move. So what she wants is a connection of her forearm to the side of my neck. What I give her is a connection of her forearm to my shoulder. So instead of getting a full connection to my neck, she meets my shoulder on one side and she meets a thumb post, which is connected to my hand, which is connected to my jaw on the other side. So when she gets to feed everything through, I just tuck everything in like so. Now she locks a figure four. And now when she goes to strangle me, there's no connection of her strangling arm to the left side of my neck. And now I pull my right elbow back towards my hip. When she goes to strangle me from here, it's a very difficult thing. She'll notice that from this position, she can't strangle me. So she has to start going into a situation where she can trap my legs. Most people will start falling belly up, which means what? That I have to follow. So as we get a fall from here, we move into a situation. We move into a situation where we end up in some kind of scenario where we're over here or some kind of scenario where we're over here. Now your partner will be trying on either side to start walking towards you to get control of your legs. This is unacceptable. Whatever I do, I'm always posting in the legs and I'm denying her the ability to trap my legs. From here, I have my chin up now because I want to talk to you guys. From down here, it's kind of muffled. But I should be in here where I'm defending. From this position, I bridge on top of my partner and I use my hand to finagle inside and catch my partner's wrist like so. And now I bridge with my hips off the floor and we pull my right elbow down and we pull one, two, three, four. When she goes to lock up, I separate my partner's elbow and hand connection. Now when she goes to make a follow up, I just post on the hip, I scissor my legs and we're out back to at least neutral or preferably in a top pin. So this thumb post inside where you connect thumb, jawline, ear to shoulder will keep you safe. You make it so you don't get strangled. As I do this, my right elbow retracts into her strangling elbow to pull back towards my own hip. This keeps a disconnection between your shoulder and your neck because ultimately, D'arce is an inverted kagatame so the shoulder strangles you on one side and the forearm strangles you on the other side. So when I pull my elbow back, the shoulder's not strangling me and when I connect thumb to jawline and ear to shoulder, her forearm isn't strangling me on this side. So that will stop her from strangling me unless she gets a connection with the legs, in which case it's mechanically so strong she can still finish me. So that's going to keep you safe. The other thing that's going to get you out is one, you just have the thumb post long enough where she can't finish you and she eventually gets tired and gets out, which is what happened when I fought Devante Johnson, I think in 2014 when I was a purple belt and he was a brown belt. He just kind of ended up letting go. I was in a D'arce for a long time and he couldn't finish me, a fully locked D'arce. And the capturing of the wrist is what actually gets you out. So if we're going here, she goes to feed everything through. First thing is I tuck the jaw. I pull the elbow back. Now when she goes to lock, it's not nearly as tight and when she gets to finish, she can't do it. So when she realizes she can't finish him here, what everyone's going to do is they're going to start falling to the side, like so. She goes to walk towards me. I'm always posting, posting, posting. When I feel like the time is right from here, I expose my partner's wrist and I catch. And now once I expose that wrist, I bridge on top of her and I use body weight to drive into her and then pull. One, two, three, four, I separate. And now from here, we're ready to go in and we're out. Okay. If at any point my partner rolls back belly down, we have to follow. So if we're here, she falls down to her side. If she comes back up, we have to follow. If she rolls all the way through, she's still belly up now. And now from here, if she goes back belly down, she will, I have to follow. And I have to follow and make sure our chest points in the same direction until I can eventually access that wrist. And once I access that wrist and we're belly up, I can go in and start separating hands. Okay. So we talked about this a little bit. Now we're going to talk about it in depth when our partner actually gets a hold of one of our legs. And this is a crisis moment because if she gets a hold of the leg and she controls it for long enough, she can finish you from here, even if you have the inside thumb position. Okay. So this time she locks up, she falls over to a hip and she walks towards me. I'm always looking to post on my partner's hips, post to the knees, whatever the case is. But if I see, she will always be reaching for my top leg. If I see she traps it, this is a disaster from here. So right from here, and I feel my knee is trapped, I post on my partner's top knee. I bring my right knee up and I post my partner's bottom knee. And now when she gets to lock them tight, I use two posting grips, a V grip and a knee to put my, to bring my heel out or bring my knee out rather. And now as she goes to hold on, we just pull everything through. So when she traps my leg, she wants to start beating me. If I just try to pull my leg out in any way, it won't happen. If I try to push on one leg, there's not enough time. It's not going to happen. My whole thing from here is I get my right knee in. If I have to scoot away, I'll do that. No problem. And I can always find a way to get my right knee in. Do whatever you have to get that right knee in. If I have to scoot away, I can. If I have to push and pump with my left hand, I'll do that too. And eventually that right knee's coming in. Now she goes to lock on tight. She gets this up high. She's tight. She goes to finish me. And we use a knee to a foot and we extract that leg however we have to. Once we extract that leg, we monitor the legs again and we go into keeping our thumb post until we can eventually escape. But it's always post the top leg, post the bottom leg, make space. If we have to, we take a foot and we continue pushing until our ankle's all the way free and we walk our legs away. And that will take massive pressure off of the strangle. And then we can catch our breath, search for the wrist, and then separate hands. Okay, so similar to Karagatame, if my partner can control one of my legs long enough to strangle me, and especially if my partner can mount me or lock a closed guard, this is the end game from here. I don't have anything, especially from darts, that's going to get you out of a fully locked closed guard. Okay? So my partner locks a darts, whether she locks up the leg or even worse, whether she locks up my hips, I just have nothing that I'm going to be able to do that's going to get me out of this darts. You're going to get finished. The darts is so tight and you just don't have any time. You have three seconds before you're ready to tap and there's not nearly enough time to do anything constructive in that amount of time. So again, if you guys have anything that you'd like to share as far as closed guard escapes and fully locked darts with someone who has good mechanics, I'd love to see it, but this is my end game right now. If I'm mounted or if I'm in closed guard, legs are locked, the darts, as far as I'm concerned, is going to finish you. All right, so we're looking to go to mount the Karagatame. Obviously there's recognizing danger with the early escapes and once you're actually in this mission, there's early and there's late escapes. I just want to tell you guys all of the escapes that you and I probably were taught from here, they just don't work. They're just delaying tactics and assuming the person has the right mechanics on top, they're going to finish you every single time. So I just want to get you out of the habit of using some of these things. When she goes for Karagatame on me, like going in here and touching your own head, this is not going to work. She's going to lock up, she's going to finish you. Going in and grabbing a leg like this or grabbing a leg like this, these are all delaying tactics. They'll give you some relief and if the guy has shitty mechanics, then he won't finish you. But just understand, if you're trying to do this against anyone who actually has good Karagatame, these are never going to work. Your main goals from here are number one, trying to bridge over the near side shoulder to get a base and elicit a reaction with a base and then bring your hands back inside. Or two, finding ways to punch the shoulder inside the strangle and start to move out in a way like that. But understand that these are all delaying tactics that more or less wedge you in place. This is just a delaying tactic. This is a delaying tactic and now I can't move. Where am I supposed to move from? How am I supposed to escape from here? It's just a delaying tactic, hoping the guy is shitty mechanics that he's not going to finish you and then just basically praying from here that you're going to get out. It's not going to work. I just wanted to give you a little intro from here, what you're trying to accomplish as far as early escape to bridging and then late escape to punching the shoulder in. But just grabbing your own leg or answering the phone or combing your hair, I've never seen them actually work on anybody high level. I just don't even teach them because I don't believe in them. So now just very, very early escapes. My partner goes to obviously get my arm over my head. She's in a mouth situation maybe and she gets mouth and she gets the arm over the head. There's always going to be a transition from the arm being over the head like so where her ear has a strong connection to my bicep and her head is inside my elbow to a situation where her ear, her opposite ear has a strong connection to the outside of my tricep. And now things start to go south from here. So the question is from here to here, what can we do to go into some kind of defenses from here? I should always be strong, of course, with my defensive hand placement and going into mouth escapes, whether it be cross post or whether it be straight post on the hip like so. We should always have strong defensive posture. We shouldn't just be up here or hugging my partner or whatever the case is. So she goes to start elevating the arm up and over the head. From here the second I feel, she goes to start passing that across. If I can one, shrug my shoulder so that it makes it hard for her to get a strong connection of this bicep to the right side of my neck. If I can shrug my shoulder and take my jaw inside that strangling arm, it's going to be much easier. And immediately if I can give a bridge over my left shoulder so when she goes to make the transition, I pull my left elbow up first and then down towards the floor. So I want to one, what I don't want is to bridge and I have her jaw get caught or I have my jaw get caught here on her shoulder and you kind of bridge and you kind of elongate your own neck and it makes things worse. So the second she goes to make this pass off, I go in and I'm posting on the hip. I can even V-grip the shoulder. The V-grip the shoulder will actually get you out better but your partner can slide her knees up and now she starts stealing the inside knee position. So it's a trade-off of how much you want to address the karagatame versus how much you want to have to deal with follow-up attacks that now you're getting deeper and deeper into this mounted situation. So you can go here but as I get a bridge, your partner steals the inside knee position. If I'm here, your partner can steal the inside knee position but you're not going to have a strong of a push to start off-balancing your partner. So there's a trade-off here. Now from this position, she goes to start making that transition over. Right from here, I shrug the shoulders and I hide my jaw from that cross face. She goes to take the ear to the outside of the tricep. I bridge, lifting the elbow and I'm pulling it down and now I have that bicep and ear connection again rather than tricep and ear connection on the opposite side. So every time your partner goes to transfer, just giving a nice little bridge as she goes to make that transition over, she goes to bring everything up. I just bridge and I get her posting and I take the hand back in. So these are just very early escapes that we can do from these positions where every time she goes to transfer from inside the bicep to outside the bicep, we can just give a small bridge, bring the elbow down, off-balance my partner and then look to go into escapes, recoveries, things like that. So very, very basic ways to off-balance your partner and just bring her head back to the inside. All right, so now let's look at early escapes where my partner actually locks up the karigatame, but she's not actually strangling me. The first thing I have to make sure of is there's no way I can have my jaw this far away from my, my chin this far away from my chest and this much exposure of my neck to her arm and to the crease of her elbow because ultimately, the tighter she gets her elbow to the side of my neck, the tighter the strangle will be. So the first thing I'm looking for, the second she goes in and she goes to make this pass or she passes her head from one side to the other is immediately I take my chin down to my chest and I shrug my shoulders. So now even if she goes to strangle me, it's going to be hard for her to get a connection of her elbow flush to my neck. So when she has to move me, move around from here and go to strangle me, it's not easy. And now from here, I take the time that I have now because there's no strangle, I take the time to start doing what I want. What I don't want to do from here is I don't want to turn in this direction. When I turn in this direction, it will make it easier for her to form that connection of her elbow to my neck. I want to turn if anything towards her in this direction. So now from here, all she gets is my jawline with her shoulder rather than if I turn this way, now my jaw starts to come out and my chin starts to come out and over the top of her arm and then she can shoot that arm deep and now I'm getting strangled. I turn into her as I shrug the shoulders. When she goes to strangle me, it's going to be hard. And now the whole thing is bridging to get the elbow out or a combination of multidirectional bridges and kips, see my partner posting, and then you're just doing pin escapes from there. But as far as early escapes, not getting strangled, the second she goes to make a pass off, what I don't want is this. She goes to pass everything across and immediately my neck is exposed, you can see my jawline from here. If a third person's watching, if you're competing or you're training, your teacher's sitting on the wall, they're watching you, and someone goes in to hit karagatame, this is what they should see from a defensive person. Go ahead. So now you can barely see my eyes from here. The huge difference from here to here. Here you're getting strangled, here you're not. And now when she goes to adapt the strangle, I turn towards her, she gets to start finishing, I think it's our bridging, if you get a bridge and she posts, great. If she doesn't post, then we go into a kip and we can move out and away. Just little things like this, hiding the jaw from the cross face, not allowing your partner to connect that elbow flush to your neck, and turning in towards your partner, towards the trapped arm, all make a big difference. And then once you can stop yourself from getting strangled, then it's a pretty easy thing to just do your generic pin escapes with your bridging, tripping, kipping, things like that. Okay, so now this time, we're in a karagatame, my opponent has dismounted, she's in its eye control and she's going to finish. If your partner's naive, and she has a very narrow base of support, whether she has a low elbow over my left shoulder, like so, or whether she has a figure four locked, okay this is just a disaster and I can easily escape. If at any point I see she has a figure four, like so, or she has like a palm to palm or a wrist to wrist grip, and her elbow is low, if at any point I see this, a simple bridge where I lift my elbow first and then chop it down towards the floor, a bridge with this motion, a combination, this motion with the arm will always get you out from here. If she does not have a post above your shoulder line, you can always bridge out. So when she goes to try to fight hard from here and she has a low elbow position, you can always bridge out, and either one, you'll crunch your partner's chin to the chest and will just fall over, or two, they'll post and you'll escape. So if at any point you sense, and you can feel it the second you bridge, if you bridge and you can move your partner at all, you're going to get out, okay. If she has a low elbow from here, she can go to strangle me as tight as she wants, you can always escape. There's always going to be a time where she has a strong palm to palm grip with a post above the shoulder line, and now the second I go to bridge, you feel, I fucking hit a wall from here, and there's just no way you're going to bridge. Whenever I see that, your last edge thing is from here to get this shoulder, my left shoulder, inside the strangle. So I hit a quick pendulum, one, two, three, four, and I shoot my shoulder forward and I expose my backs. This is how Tex Johnson actually escaped a few of my early kagatames when I was just trying to really tire him out and not finish him, and then the fire alarm started going off and I was like, oh, got to get this over with, and then I just finished kagatame. But it is an escape because those were pretty tight and he did manage to escape a couple of them. So this is a legitimate late escape. So from here, if I feel like I'm strangling and she has a low elbow or not so good of a base, I bridge over the same side of the shoulder as a trapped arm, left versus left, right versus right. If, on the other hand, I feel like I got to bridge, she has a high elbow, there's just no way I can bridge. So I pendulum, depending on how long you have before the lights go out will determine the amount of pendulums you can do. The more pendulums, the more momentum, the better, but if you're going to go out in the next three seconds, you just have time for one and then a big one and then you hope for the best. But if she's strangling you, but you feel like you have 10 seconds, I can build momentum through here. And then my whole thing is as I pendulum, I shoot my shoulder forward and my hand comes down towards my hip. When she goes to hold on, when she goes to strangle, this is what we want. And now there's an obvious degree of back exposure here, but you're not getting immediately finished with the kagatame and you can at least continue the match and then fight out of back attack or whatever the case is. Okay, so now end game is obviously the strangle's in place, I can't bridge over the near shoulder and the kagatame is so tight where I just don't have enough time or even I can't sometimes punch my shoulder inside. So she's strangling me, I try to bridge over that near shoulder, she has good base, and now I'm trying to pendulum, I'm trying to punch her shoulder forward, but her head position is so good, her body placement is so good, and I'm trying to punch her shoulder forward and I just can't get my shoulder inside that strangle and time's ticking, time's ticking, and now I end up getting strangled and I have to tap. So the end game is always about time, can I either bridge over the near side shoulder or can I use a pendulum to punch my shoulder inside the strangle before the strangle comes on and it's game over. All right, so now we're going to move into north-south strangles, made famous by Marcelo. You don't actually see them that much in competition. You know, it's a pretty easy thing to stop the initial setup, you just look towards your partner and you keep your hands inside. So it's more of like an opportunistic thing now where people are moving through transitions and they get caught with a north-south, but it's really not something you see that often anymore and Marcelo used to do it a lot, but now you see it here and there, but it's not really like a staple of anyone's game. But nonetheless, people do use them, Marcelo made them famous, so we have to go through some north-south defense. It can be a very effective strangle if it is set because it's a hard move to escape and you have to have proper frames to actually get out. So moving to some early defenses, you're just recognizing what the dangers are, but then there's some early and late defenses and then we'll move on from there. All right, let's look at just some, just recognizing danger, just early defenses. They're kind of one and the same for this one, so that's why I just put it into one segment. But just let's look at some early defenses where my partner is in north-south and she's looking to go in and start strangling me. All right, first, whenever I see my partner's elbow coming up and over my shoulder, you know your partner's trying to strangle you with north-south. So the second I see my partner's in north-south, first of all, I want to have hands inside if I can. This will make it easy for me to go in and recover. Maybe I have, if I have two elbows inside, that's great. If I have one elbow inside, that's okay. And then maybe sometimes I end up having no elbows inside, that's not really great, but you know, no worries. But any time I see my partner's elbow is over my shoulder rather than under my arm, I know there's a potential for me to get finished. So whenever I see this, whenever I see an elbow is over my shoulder, even if she's not doing anything suspicious or dangerous with it yet, I'm always focused on turning into my partner and looking towards her torso. So this just immediately takes away all dangers of north-south strangles. So at any point you feel like you're dealing with a north-south expert, either pommeling hands into situations where your elbow's above your partner's, your elbow's inside your partner's elbow like so, or inside their partner's shoulder like so, and a combination between that and turning towards your partner. This recognizing this, recognizing your partner's hand position, where it is and what they have to be doing to start putting in north-south strangles will get you through most of the dangers dealing with north-south strangled danger. As your partner goes to set the strangle, so that's recognizing danger, as your partner goes to set the strangle, I just turn and I look towards my partner. I can always look to come inside and I can even take my hand inside like so, and I can use that to make just a little space where I physically touch my own shoulder, and I just roll my wrist forward to make enough space to turn my chin towards my partner. So even if I'm starting to get caught from here, I just take my hand through and I physically touch my own shoulder. When she goes to drop her shoulders and set, that is enough space. If I don't have that and she goes to just start setting, it's hard for me, if that's possible, it's hard for me to start turning towards my partner. So this inside hand position, rolls him to her shoulder, when she goes to set it, will allow me to turn inside that strangle. Okay? And if it goes to early defenses when the hands are in there, the strangle isn't completely set yet, I just turn towards my partner, and if we have to, we use a hand assist to just touch her own shoulder, roll the wrist forward, and that rolling of the wrist forward will bring my partner's shoulder far, or will raise my partner's shoulder enough to where I can turn towards my partner with my chin and create enough space to start to face my partner and escape. So as the strangle goes to come into place, we just go and we touch her own shoulder. Now she can put her shoulder down as much as she wants to start to set it, we just go and we turn towards our partner like so, and we're out and away. Now obviously, once the strangle is set, things like that won't work because of the fact that she takes away too much space and now I won't have enough room to turn my chin, and then we have to go into late escapes. But that's just recognizing danger, stopping your partner from initially setting the strangle, to always turning in to look at your partner, having good hand position, recognizing their hand position, and then when they go to set the strangle, just turning in and hitting a nice early defense by turning towards your partner and immediately taking away any shoulder strangle danger. All right, so now we're in a fully locked strangle. Once it's actually set, it's on. Okay. Now, what we need, or what my partner needs rather, when she goes to start strangling me, is she needs her head moving down in this direction, and they're sagging her body down and away, and that elongates my neck and moves me into a strangle. Okay, that's what my partner needs. What I need is to start finding frames to start getting inside my partner's shoulder line so I can start turning towards my partner and eventually get into a situation where I can move my chin so far where there's no strangling pressure. What she needs is my chin and my nose, my whole face pointing up towards the ceiling, or she can even walk it, be pointing out towards the elbow, it's even a little bit better. Okay. What I need is to be looking completely at my partner like so. Okay. Now, it is incorrect to start framing initially with my hand opposite side my head. Okay. So, what I don't want is for my left hand to start coming inside and trying to come inside here and start framing inside, because now from here she can just post my tricep, she can take her head outside my arm, and from here she can post my arm, and now she's going to start moving her head down and away, and I get strangled through my own mistake here. So, the first thing I want, she has her head in good position, and she's looking to start moving away. So, I take her head and I physically frame in here, and I push her head out and away. Now, I take my hand in like so, and I reinforce my frame with the second hand. So, I take an initial frame with my hand in the same side as my head's on, and we push my partner's head out and away. From here, I take a second hand and I just go in and I reinforce it like so. Now, with two hands reinforced, my partner goes to start strangling. I use a pendulum, and I move my partner's head out and away. Now, she has to move it down and away, I move it out and away, and that head moving out and away allows me to start turning toward my partner and going into full escapes from here. So, once again, she puts me in a north-south strangle, if I take an initial frame and I try to come through here, she just posts right on my tricep and she moves the head outside. Okay, isn't that good? So, right from this position, I want to start moving her head out and away, so that her head can never get outside my tricep. From here, we take an initial frame, and we start pushing into our partner, like so. Now, from here, we take a second hand, we bring it inside our own wrist, and we reinforce it. So, once she goes to push into me with her head, and her head goes to start moving down and away, and she goes to keep my head pointing in the same direction it is right now, it's difficult because of the fact that I can use that frame to push her head and pendulum. So once she goes to finish me, we go in, we use that pendulum, and we move out and away from our partner. This is not going to be comfortable, it's not going to be easy, but you're in a fully locked north-south, and this is what we're looking to do. We're looking to use one frame on the same side as the strangle to push my partner's head away, and then a second frame that comes inside and reinforces it. And then a pendulum of my legs to push the head out and away, so that makes space so her head moves, and her body will move, and then we can hit our escape or return in towards our partner. So she locks up nice and tight. Now we're out and away, and we're ready to go with all of our escapes where we can either invert or bring our knees back inside, rotate back in front of our partner, and go back into offense. All right, so obviously everything comes down to time now with the endgame. So my partner has a north-south strangle, and the question is, can in the amount of time available, can I look to form frames and face my partner before she strangles me? If my partner's moving down and away, and she decides to strangle me, maybe I can't even do it. I can't even get hands inside. Maybe my partner's too strong. I can't move the head. I can't get a frame inside, and then it's too tight, and I'm just not going to be able to escape before my partner strangles me. As always, can I get my frames in place? Can I move her head position out of alignment before the strangle's too tight, everything's set in place, and the lights go out?
