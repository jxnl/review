 Alright, so now we're going to look at imiri Ashi Garami. You saw a lot in the attacking from guard, Senpai Ninja seated, a lot of positional ways to sit your partner down from imiri Ashi Garami. I'm not going to repeat that here because it's like hours worth of stuff. Just going into imiri Ashi Garami, as I mentioned before, an imiri Ashi Garami is a great way to control to some degree both of your partner's legs and hips, to make it very hard for your partner to come up and crush you, assuming your legs are set correctly, and to deny your partner any form of back exposure and to expose your partner's heel. So, just going into an imiri Ashi Garami. This is the most common and most likely leg position you're going to find yourself in when you initially enter into your partner's legs. It's available from almost any given position, top, bottom, doesn't make a difference. Standing position, this is where I pulled Roosevelt into in that semifinals ADCC match in 2022. It's a very, very common position. So from here, we go in and we initially enter in, and we'll talk about setting the legs in a second. Just a little intro into imiri Ashi Garami. It's great for exposing your partner's heel. When I go with very talented players from here, it's one of the best ways to initially expose our partner's heel. When she goes to heel slip from here, it's a very hard thing because of the fact that I can control both of my partner's legs, control that far leg, get the knees pointing away from me, and then as she goes to come forward, I can go in and I can start pointing my Ashi Garami in directions where I can easily expose my partner's heel and get good fights, so you can then transfer to outside Ashi and actually go into breaks. Just reiterating what we already talked about, going into a little intro, and then we'll move on from here. All right, so the question is, how do we set our legs properly? Whether it be from a standing position, whether it be from a seated position, what leg position are we trying to end up in? If we're looking to scoot into an imiri Ashi Garami from a situation where we're seated, and I follow my leg to the inside position, I'm going to look to take our hand over our partner's ankle like so. I'm going to take a second hand here to my partner's knee. Now my whole thing is I don't want to pull against my partner's legs with my arms. It's a losing battle. What I want, rather, is to pull my partner's leg just far enough where I can shoot my knee behind my partner's knee like so. Now instead of pulling with my hands and my arms against my partner's leg, I can pull my knee into my chest. When my partner goes to pull that leg away, it's a pretty easy thing to suck my partner in like so. Now, once I suck my partner in as far as I can, I give a little additional scoot so that my hips are as close as possible to my partner's hips like so. Now I take my foot, I fire it up, and I connect it to my partner's hip. I take my knee and my heel together. This makes it hard for my partner to separate the knee and the heel connection and peel my foot off. If I'm over here somewhere, my partner just grabs my heel and then takes it off easy. Whereas here, I cover the heel so it's much harder, not impossible, much harder for my partner to separate my feet. Now I want my right foot to control my partner's far hamstring like so, so that from here, I have a nice strong hip-to-hip connection. I have heel-to-knee connection. I have a slight extension with my right leg. Now I pinch my knees together, I pull my left heel in towards my butt, and I just raise my hips off the ground. When she goes to move towards me now, it's not going to be easy. When she goes to move away, it's not going to be easy. Now from here, we have a nicely set ashi garami where we can go in and we can start taking our partner's heel and exposing it. As we talked about before, when we're standing, we want to eliminate the daylight between my hips and my partner's leg. When I fire myself up into position, this is what I want here. Now when she goes to explode away from me, even when there's no Achilles grip, and she goes to jump off the ground, pull the leg out, it's just not going to happen. That's what we want. The same thing on the ground. I want my hips down, I want my hips close as possible to my partner's hips. I want my heel and knee as close as possible together, and I want that far leg controlled. Now my partner goes to move around, there's very good control over my partner's leg, we remain set and isolated, and we can go in and start to expose that heel. When I'm looking to move into any kind of ashi garami, we're in our double seated. When she's standing, I just throw my ashi garami up, and we've gone over this before, but when we're double seated, I take false grip, false grip. Knee comes in behind, and now I pull myself in towards my partner as I pull my knee in towards my chest and I pull my partner towards me. When she goes to bring that leg free, there's a connection point here, connection point here, and a connection point here with my knee. When she gets the palm of that leg, I pull it out and away, the easiest thing in the world to go in, pull myself in nice and sticky, and now set the legs, start to expose my partner's heel for the win. That's just setting the initial imiri ashi garami, getting our legs into good position to control our partner. Now let's look at, as we're setting the initial imiri ashi garami, going into a stress test. This is just to ensure that our ashi garami is tight so that we can hold our partner long enough to actually enact our breaking mechanics later on. A couple of ways my opponents can react here. I'm going to initially enter into this imiri ashi garami. This is especially common if someone's standing and you knock them down to their butt and they use the momentum to try to drag themselves back and away and extract the leg. The first thing we want is to make that solid connection like so. We're not going to put any kind of Achilles grip on because the Achilles grip gives you additional wedging, even if I just have an Achilles grip and she tries to pull herself back and away, the foot won't come out. She'll drag me along the floor with her. We don't want to cheat with the Achilles grip for now. We want to make sure that the ashi garami is doing the holding and the wedging, not the upper body gripping. We put this ashi garami in place and we enact a stress test where now my partner takes her two hands and she tries to walk backwards along the mat. It should look like your partner's dragging one body, not when she goes to drag herself away, there's a disconnection and she pulls her knee out. This is not what I'm looking for. It should look like I'm connected to my partner and when she goes to pull herself back, I move with her. That's it for one person. Okay, this is the goal here. We put everything in place and what I don't want is a slippage problem where she goes to move and then she slides two or three inches and with every slide, she slides further and further away. Okay? What I want is this. We go in, we lock up, everything's in tight and now without even using my hands, when she goes to pull back and away, there's no separation between our two bodies. We have a strong ashi garami. My partner can't pull herself back out and away from me. Okay? The second stress test is from here. My partner will roll through in either direction. It doesn't matter because you end up belly down either way. But from here, I go into an ori miyashi garami, she goes to roll through and we end up in this position. Now, how do we hold our partner to rotate? Walk your hands this way. How do we hold our partner in this position here? The whole thing from here is she wants to straighten her leg and pull it out past my knee line. So the second she goes into a roll, whether you have a heel hook grip or not, my whole thing from here is to chase the floor with my top knee. So my left knee points down towards the floor like so. I create a strong back healing motion with my left leg. And from here, we pinch the knees together and we just suck the knees into our chest. When she goes to straighten that leg and she goes to pull it out and away, it's hard. If she goes to crawl along the mat, she'll pull me as if we're one person. And this is what we want from here. What we don't want is the knee rising towards the ceiling. She goes to pull that knee free, she's out and away. This is no good. So the second she goes to roll belly down, we get a second stress test. By closing the knee, back healing. Pinching the knees, bringing the knees to the chest. She goes to explode away, which is not going to happen from here. And now from here, we can go in and start putting pressure on our partner. The third stress test is when my partner tries to come forward. If I have my inside leg here on my partner's near side hamstring, my partner goes to come forward, she will always be able to come forward and crush me. So I make sure I monitor my partner's foreleg. And from here, the second she goes to come up, I just raise my hips off the floor slightly. So if she goes to aggressively come forward and get to my head and shoulders, it's just not going to happen from here. And then from here we can go forward and we can start to expose our partner's leg like so. Additionally, the last stress test is stopping my partner from re-pommeling. If my leg's in here somewhere just floating around, my partner just scoops out to the side, re-pommels her leg, and now I'm going to meet her washi and she can start to attack me from here. So I always want to have good control over that far leg. So if she has to pommel inside, it's not going to be impossible, but it's not going to be easy from here. That gives me more than enough time to expose my partner's heel and get onto his hands. So we stress test the initial Irimi Ashi garami. I have my partner trying to pull herself back and away. I try to roll through and pull her leg, her knee out. I'm trying to come forward and crush me and by trying to re-pommel her legs. If I can avoid all these things and eventually a live situation, you have a strong, solid Irimi Ashi garami and I can go into start to attack your partner's heel and go in for your eventual breaks. All right, so now let's first start in our first submission. After we can initially stress test our Ashi garami, we can control our partner. Let's go in and start to go in and finish Achilles locks. Understand that if at any point your partner is peeling your legs and you feel like the Ashi garami isn't as robust as you want it to, just switch to an Achilles grip. The Achilles grip alone, once she goes to move back and away, the Achilles grip alone will control my partner a lot more than you think it will. And that will give you time to re-pommel your legs or set your legs back in some kind of various form of Ashi garami and then go into a follow-up attack later. If at any point your partner peels your foot off the hip and you feel like you don't want to lose your partner, just switch to an Achilles and you can control your partner for a long amount of time just with the Achilles grip. Now we're going for an initial Achilles lock. We want to come in and again, we want to go from that controlling Achilles to a situation where we take our hand through and then we just switch to an Achilles like so. Now right from here, a couple of different grips we can use. They're all good. Anything that keeps my hands high is what I'm looking to do. So we can come forward, we can physically catch our partner's shin like so, we can grab our own wrist here. This keeps my hands relatively high. We can physically grab our own hand like so and we don't want to expose our elbow to our partner's two-on-one where she takes her hands and locks them like so and pulls my hand down. If I'm going to use this grip, I take my elbow in like so and my hands up nice and high. And we can also go through, we can use a full figure four grip like so where we grab our own bicep. All of these are good. Anything that keeps my hands high is what I'm looking for. I need my hands as high as possible and my chin as low as possible. And now from here, we just take our elbow in towards our own ribcage and we just have a strong connection here through the ashigarami. From this position, what I don't want is for my hips to come forward and my chin to come out and away. So from here, my chin stays low, I start to look belly down and then my hips push away from my partner's hips. When she goes to come forward into me, that pushing away action makes everything tight and now as my hips move away, we get strong finishes with the Achilles lock belly down. We always want to bring everything belly down if we can with Achilles locks. We have this initial control Achilles, we shoot everything through. From here, we switch from a controlling Achilles to a breaking Achilles. Everything comes up high. From here, elbow comes down to the ribcage. We lock up the ashigarami nice and tight. From here, if I bridge forwards, you can get good breaks but you see how my hands are dropping. It's impossible to bridge with the Achilles grip forwards and still have the chin low. If my hips come forward, I start to extend my body, the hands will inherently drop and my chin will come away from my hands. So from here, I keep good shin position, I keep good hand position. And now from here, I just extend my right leg, I extend my left leg into my partner's hip that pushes my hips away. And now from here, once my hips are away, that allows me to throw my hips in a little bit and that gives you strong breaks with the Achilles. The head's coming forward, hips are coming back, and that gives you incredibly strong finishes on your basic Achilles lock with a variety of grips, whether it be the original, the old school grip that everyone likes to use where you grab your partner's shin and then grab your own wrist, whether you go full figure four, whether you go hand to hand, anything that keeps your hand high and your chin low is what you're looking for. All right, so very, very basic. We lock an Achilles grip and our partner, maybe your Ashi Grabe is a little bit loose. A lot of times people will kick and pull, kick and pull, kick and pull. So they push their foot in and they try to use almost like a rocking motion. We're out here, they kick the foot and they try to pull it out and you feel like you just lose the foot eventually. Whenever I see my partner kicks the foot in nice and deep, first of all, the Ashi Grabe should be controlling your partner from moving back and away and from really pulling this knee to the chest. So the Ashi Grabe is set in place. That makes it hard for your partner to pull the foot out. If at any point your partner goes to pull the leg out, just focus on not controlling to control from the knee to the ankle, just focus on catching your partner's heel on your wrist, like the knot at the end of the rope like we talked about. When your partner kicks that foot through, you make it loose. When she goes to extract now, I'm loose until she goes to extract, go ahead, and then I tighten it. So it gets caught even deeper. Now when she goes to boot it again, she won't be able to. And now from here, we can go down to the elbow, we can push everything out and away, we can get strong finishes with the Achilles lock. So when she goes to extract, number one, the Ashi Grabe holds her in place. Number two, she goes to kick through and boot like so. Now it's hard to finish the Achilles. Now I don't want her to keep kicking and create momentum. So the second she goes to pull out and away, I'm loose, and I catch right at the end. She goes to boot, she goes to pull, and I catch. So now it's the tightest it's going to be. Now the second I fall, without locking my hands, the second my hips move away, it gets tight. Hips move away, and then from here, once the hips are far out and away, then my hips come in slightly, and that gives you incredibly strong breaking mechanics for the Achilles. What you don't want is someone doing this. They're just constantly locking Achilles. They're just constantly doing this, and then it just generates enough motion to eventually become loose. The second you punch your foot through, she's loose, loose, loose, and as I go to pull it, it tightens. She catches right at the end of the lever, and now I go to boot it again, it's too far in there to actually shoot it through, and I get beat. That's how you make the Achilles lock super, super tight. So don't let someone generate a push-pull action where it's five, six, seven, eight, and then eventually the foot comes out. One, two, catch, and then tighten everything up. All right, so the Ashi Garami should stop your partner from coming forward into you, but a lot of times, especially if someone's much bigger than you, they try to boot the foot and drive forward into you to take pressure off the Achilles, which is a smart thing. The good news is, from a Rimi Ashi Garami, it's pretty hard for them to drive forward. With an Ashi Garami, it's a lot easier for them to push forward into you, but nonetheless, the way that we stop our partner from driving forward, let's say we go in, we switch to this tight Achilles, and now my partner goes to start driving forward towards me in hopes of coming up, maybe getting into my trap with this hand and pulling herself in, and now she shoots the foot through and there's no Achilles lock. The whole thing, once I'm in this position, the second I lock the Achilles, I instantly take my elbow and I bring it down to my hip. This is how I stop my partner from coming forward. Once my elbow is on my hip like so, when she goes to drive forward into me, she can drive forward, but when she goes to boot the foot, she can't kick the foot through. It's in a different position now than it was before. If my elbow is out and away from my hip and she goes to drive forward, she can drive her foot through that space and boot the foot. In order to stop my partner from coming forward into me, which is a very common reaction, the second, even if the Ashi Garami is sloppy or she beats my foot and she clears the hip, whatever the case is, the second I lock the Achilles, I'm instantly elbow to hip. When she goes to kick that foot through, it's just not going to happen from here. Now from here, we can make space, we can look to convert to a post Ashi, and now from here we can move out and away and then finish our partner. We can go into a roll through, sloppy like that in previous instructionals, and then roll our partner through and expose our partner's heel, which I think I have a plan for this, but I've showed it in previous instructionals as well. The main thing is setting the Ashi Garami properly so they can't come forward. The second you lock up the Achilles, making sure you have proper elbow position. She needs to kick her foot straight, like so. If I put a bend in the leg by taking my elbow down to my hip, now when she gets to kick her foot straight, there's no space. Now the second my hips from any given leg position move away from my partner and then I extend, you get incredibly strong finishes with the Achilles. Just immediately, the second you lock up the Achilles, it's elbow to hip action, so she can't come forward and push that foot through and boot it. Using your elbow position in the Yorimi Ashi Garami is one thing. There's always going to be times where your partner comes forward and maybe the Yorimi Ashi Garami isn't set properly and you're not controlling the far leg so they can come forward or the partner peels her foot off the hip and they come forward anyways. Whenever I see my partner is going to come forward and I feel like if she does come forward, there's going to be too much pressure on me and she's going to be able to shoot the leg through. You guys know when you've done Achilles locks before, it's hard to get them perfect. Whenever I see either this foot isn't set right or my partner peels the foot off of the hip, whenever I see this, I just switch right to a Post Ashi. I take my foot from the inside and I just place it here on my partner's hip. Right from this position, we take our second foot and we physically step on our own foot like so. Now I physically have weight over my partner's hip. My partner goes to come forward into me, I just focus on pushing my partner's hip down towards the floor and raising my hips off the floor like so. When she goes to come forward towards me, it's not easy. If she strips the foot off the hip like so and goes to come forward, she can come forward very easy from here. When she goes to come forward now, there's a physical wedge between myself and her. From here, I switch to the Post Ashi and the Post Ashi actually allows me to get a much stronger break because I can push off my partner's hips. The second I lock up, I feel I get my Achilles in place, we go and we're ready to finish. From here, she goes to strip my grip off, I switch Post Ashi. She goes to come forward. From here, we push the hips away and now from here, we bridge and we look over the shoulder and we get incredibly strong finishes by taking my elbow down to my hip, extending and I look up and over my shoulder. I counter the forward pressure by switching from an imiri Ashi Garami like so to a different variation of Ashi Garami, Post Ashi like so. Now I'm trying to loosen it up a little bit. When she goes to come forward from here, I put pressure over my partner's hip. I bring my elbow down and now as she goes to come forward, there's weight over my partner's hip. My whole thing from here is I move my hips away. Now as I bridge, that gives me strong finishes on the Achilles lock where we can start going belly down. We use the Post Ashi to get a much stronger break and stop our partner from coming forward into us. Another thing we can do, let's say we can't switch to a Post Ashi. Maybe my partner goes to come forward and she knows that I'm going to switch to a Post Ashi. From here, as she goes to come forward, maybe from here, she holds my leg. She holds my knee. Now I'm going to pull my knee to my chest and I can't get my foot to my partner's hip. Maybe this foot fell off or maybe from here, we switch to a Post Ashi. My partner takes my foot to the outside. Now I'm an outside Ashi and she goes to start coming forward. There's many different things that can happen from here. Whether you're in a Rimi Ashi Garami and your partner comes belly down or whether you're in a Post Ashi and your partner transfers you to an outside Ashi, we can still go belly down and we can start putting heat on our partner as she goes to come forward toward me. So whatever I see from this position, we go in and we start to finish. Maybe my partner peels my foot off like so. She goes to start coming forward toward me. Whenever I see this, as she comes up, we just heist up to our two knees like so. Whether my foot's in the middle or I transfer to outside Ashi, it doesn't make a difference. I switch from locked hands, however it may be, to a Post hand. And now I start to build height like so. As I build height, I lift my elbow to my hip. My elbow and my rib cage and my hip always stay glued to one another. From here I post my hand on the floor and now I just widen my knees. And from here, as my knees widen, I take my elbow down towards my hip like we did before and now I just give a strong bridging motion. As my head comes up, my hips drive down. I'm going to get a strong belly down Achilles effect for the win. As my partner goes to come forward and crush me, we just go into a belly down Achilles, which is more powerful because now there's body weight involved. So from here, we're in position. I go to start finishing the Achilles. We have hands locked. She goes to start coming forward toward me. As I see that, we just go into a belly down position here. I post the hand. Now I lock everything up tight. I just glue my own fist to my chest. As she goes to come forward and crush me, I tighten everything by taking the elbow in. Now she goes to drive forward. I widen the knees. I start bridging. I go belly down and we get strong finishes for the win. Okay? From this side so you can see the elbow position. She goes to start coming forward. From here I heist. Now as soon as I heist, we want this elbow on the floor, elbow to hip. Knees widen, hand post, head drives up as my hips come down and we get strong finishes with belly down Achilles. You'll notice I lock everything up tight. She's on breaking point here. I still have all this motion to go through. We counter my partner coming forward by going into a belly down Achilles. Then from there, we can go in, finish our partner and force her to either take us back belly up and then transition from there or finish belly down with a nice Achilles break in the belly down position. Switching to butterfly Ashi is another great option that we have. When our partner either goes to come forward or most of the time when our partner tries to peel our foot off the hip and step over the foot to start scooting out in a way. Many times from here, we go in and our partner tries to come forward. She can't come forward because a lot of times the foot is blocking the hip. She peels the foot off. Now she goes to step and she has to sit over my foot and hold my foot into a butterfly position here like so. Now you have a choice. You can either go into a butterfly post Ashi or you can go into a full butterfly Ashi where I just throw the leg up and over like so. Now my partner goes to come forward towards me, it makes it difficult because of the fact that I have a wedge here underneath my partner's hamstring. When she goes to boot her leg and goes to drive up towards me, it's a difficult thing from here because of my leg position. She can't straighten the leg to boot it. In order for her to boot the leg, to boot her foot, look what she has to do. She has to kick the leg straight and straighten the leg and that allows her to push the foot further enough forward in order to actually get the boot in place. When I have my butterfly hook underneath as a butterfly Ashi, I have a reinforced wedge now where I connect my foot to my own hamstring. Now I'm physically pushing my foot as a wedge into my partner's hamstring with my own hamstring. Now when she goes to straighten that leg, she can't because of the butterfly hook. When she goes to boot the leg now, it's not going to be impossible but it's much, much harder to straighten that leg. In combination with my elbow position, it's almost impossible now. Now when she goes to drive forward and boot that leg, it's just not going to happen. Now we focus on closing our right knee towards the floor. We focus from here on moving the hips out and away. As the right knee closes, the hips move away. Once we have distance with the hips, now we start bridging, looking over the bottom shoulder and we get incredibly strong finishes with the belly down Achilles from a butterfly Ashi. The second you feel you're in this position, your partner goes to start sitting up and over your leg. I don't want to lose it from here. There's no control to butterfly with the Ashi Garami now. This is no good. So from here, we catch our partner like so. We switch either to a post butterfly Ashi, which is incredibly powerful. We're now from here. We can go in and from here we can move the hips away. That adds pressure and then we start to bridge or we can go all the way through and we can catch. This will give you a stronger mechanical advantage. We can get stronger breaks from here but your partner can take a hand through and start to threaten a Stemulox from here and start to give you problems. This will keep your foot safe and it will stop your partner from aggressively exploding away from you if they're greased up or something, if they're super slippery. This back heel behind your partner's hips will give you a better ability to control your partner from moving away from you. As far as control, this is a little bit better and safety is a little bit better. This mechanically is a lot stronger to actually break. You can go to a post butterfly Ashi or you can just go to a full butterfly Ashi and throw the leg out and away. This is a great way to stop your partner both from coming forward into you and booting the leg and a great way to deal with someone who is constantly peeling the foot off the hip and looking to scoot away. The second I feel, she goes to peel my foot off. The second she raises the hips, my foot comes in and I just fire this leg up and over. Now we're ready to go. Even if I have a controlling Achilles from here, when she goes to boot that leg, it's the easiest thing to make the adjustment. Now we can go in, easily get to a situation where I can break my partner with a butterfly Ashi. Remember, you go and make the transition from a Rimi Ashi Garami to a post butterfly Ashi or just a regular butterfly Ashi, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. This is what I was talking about with the fluidity from Ashi Garami to Ashi Garami. Once we move into a butterfly Ashi, understand that there are other Ashi Garamis that you can move into, whether it be your partner stays seated, your partner comes on top of you, you have a lot of different options from here because now you're pommeling their legs to a different position. Let's take a look at some of these. Starting off this Achilles grip here, my partner takes their foot off, she goes to step over, and from here we go into a butterfly Ashi. Understand that from here we can start using that double trouble idea that we looked at before where I physically place a wedge behind my partner's kneecap and I grab a false grip over my partner's ankle like so. When she goes to move her second leg now, it's difficult. I control the space between her knees with the Ashi Garami. Now from here, I have a choice where from here I can of course always fire into an outside Ashi Garami, I can just take my foot off and go to outside Ashi Garami on this leg. I can also shoot my heel across to this side and I can pull myself into outside Ashi Garami on this leg. Now from here we can go into attacks on our partner's opposite leg. Maybe I broke my partner's leg on this side, I want to transition to the opposite side, I can do that. You can transfer outside Ashi Garami on one leg and outside Ashi Garami on the opposite leg. Once I'm in this position, we can go in and we can start to spin our partner's leg. I can look to start coming up into this position here and now I can take my foot, rotate, from here. Once I start spinning my partner's leg, we can go into a Shiro position and we can tommel the leg to the inside. And now from here we can go in and we can either spin to a cross Ashi on this side or we can backstep to a cross Ashi on this side. There's many different options we have from here. If my partner, if I move into this butterfly Ashi here and from here my partner goes to start coming forward towards me, we can drive our knee to our partner's hip and as she comes forward we can invert and go into a cross Ashi Garami from here. There's many different ways that we can move when I start making transitions to a butterfly Ashi off of that initial Orimi Ashi Garami. Whenever I see I make a transition to this butterfly Ashi, from here there's many different ways that we can go. If my partner adds a building to her feet from here, we can go into reverse Ashi X guard situations. We can put our partner's hands down on the floor, we can elevate our partner in, we can go into cross Ashi. If my partner stands up, that's all Senpai Guard, seated guard Senpai Guard going into cross Ashi from here. There's many different ways that we can choose to move off this initial butterfly Ashi. In general, she stays seated, we can move to the far leg. We can of course stay on the near leg, whether it be with butterfly Ashi or outside Ashi. We can start coming into Oshiro positions, top Oshiro positions, where I start driving my knee across and now from here we start switching to scoop grips and going in and entering into our partner's right leg as we were controlling before. We can start coming up and we can start going into back steps and entering into our partner's legs with back steps on the opposite leg. You can do a lot of this from a Rimi Ashi Garami as well. From here, if your partner goes to drive forward towards you, we can do all these things where we knock the hips to the floor and now I can back step and knock the hip to the floor. Now we can slide around and start going into cross Ashi. With a Rimi Ashi Garami, now we're starting to combine things. With a Rimi Ashi Garami and with a butterfly Ashi, when your partner starts to come forward towards you, they put themselves in a dilemma. If they stay in their butt, they get leg locked. If they start driving towards you, then you can start either pinning hips or as the far leg comes towards you, you can start inverting and going into cross Ashi. You can come on top of your partner, you can spin the leg, you can back step. There's a ton of different variations you can have here where it starts with a Rimi Ashi Garami but then you progress into cross Ashi, into one leg or the other. If your partner stands up, you have X guard, reverse X guard, Ashi X guard. There's tons of different ways you can transition from here. Just keep this in mind. We'll get more advanced as we go. Just keep this in mind as we go through the instructional where just because you're starting one Ashi Garami, doesn't mean you have to stay there. You can transition from one Ashi Garami to the next almost seamlessly provided you know what's going on and you're hitting the transitions at the correct time. Now you start going for Achilles locks. The second you have a controlling Achilles, people are just going to start to boot their legs right away. It'll be hard to make a transition to a tight Achilles lock. Sometimes even if you get a tight Achilles lock and you break people, they just don't respect the Achilles lock. They're just going to take breaks and then you're going to have to move to a heel hook anyways. Whenever I see a Rimi Ashi Garami and I get a nice controlling Achilles from here and my partner boots the leg. Whenever I see this, this is always your cue to start going in and start attacking heel hooks. Now there's a couple of ways that we can put a bend in the leg from a Rimi Ashi Garami. If we take my hand through like so and we use a similar grip that we did with the Achilles grip, I can put a bend pretty easy in my partner's leg from here. Whether I just take my hand through, whether I grab my own knee, we can always go in and start putting a bend in our partner's leg. This takes a lot of time is the problem. It is more robust at putting a bend in your partner's leg, but because you're in a Rimi Ashi Garami, in my opinion, you don't really need it. It is a great way to put a bend in your partner's leg, but it takes so much extra time that I would rather just grab a false grip over my partner's knee like so. The whole time she's trying to fight this foot off and you only have a second or two before she takes that foot and peels it off and now you have to transition to something else. In my opinion, it's the best to just go into from a Rimi Ashi Garami, take a nice deep false grip here where I physically grab my partner's hamstring like a handle and I use this to start exposing my partner's heel. The second she, if she points her toes from here, it's going to be hard to expose the heel, but now from here, it's the easiest thing in the world to move my hips away and lock an Achilles. Now, once the Achilles is locked, now it's going to be easy to go and finish the Achilles grip with the Achilles. The second she goes to boot the leg to avoid the Achilles, now from here it's the easiest thing in the world to grab a false grip like so. I pull my elbow to my hip with the intention of taking my partner's heel or my partner's knee and bring it across to my hip. I point my knees up at the ceiling. This will put a bend in my partner's leg pretty easily from here. When she goes to straighten her leg hard, it's the straightening of her leg versus the directionality of my two knees versus the pulling with my arm. I can easily put, even with very strong people, a bend in the leg pretty easily from here. Now from here, we just use that same cowboy drill, where from here we just go in and we just catch our partner's heel by aligning our forearm with our partner's foot like so. Then right from here, once we have this initial grip, now we can go in and depending on what our partner does, we can make our next move. We play a dilemma game between the Achilles. If she points her toes, I'm trying to get to the heel hook, I can't do it. You move out and away and we lock the Achilles. From here, I start trying to get the Achilles. She boots the foot. Whenever I see this, we put a bend in the leg by using their two knees to start pointing out and across. I use a false grip to pull my partner's knee to my hip. From here, we use that cowboy drill and we just go in and we catch like so. Now from here, we're ready to go in, lock up heel hooks and get our win. We play the heel hook, Achilles dilemma. My partner's foot's booted, we get the heel hook. If my partner's toes are pointed, we go for the Achilles. Now we're going to look at finishing mechanics from a Rimi Ashi Garami. Most of the time you're going to switch to outside Ashi, but you can finish from a Rimi Ashi Garami too. When we're in a Rimi Ashi Garami and we catch a hold of this heel hook, again, I need this coupled force. I need the toes coming down towards the butt and I need the heel coming up towards the chin. The first thing I want is to have the Ashi Garami of course set in place, everything nice and tight in position like so. Now, when I go to actually break my partner's legs, the first thing I'm going to talk about is the leg position, then I'm going to move to the upper body position. Understand that when you're breaking someone's leg and you're trying to do this live, you're not doing it in steps. Everything's happening simultaneously. We go in, we have heel and knee connection like so. We have knees pinched, we have a back heel with our left leg coming in towards our butt like so. Once we get a grip on our partner's heel, we want to bend the leg. We don't want it completely straight and we don't want it bent so much that my partner can come forward and get to my hands. This is more prevalent of a problem when you have outside Ashi Garami. You can get extremely strong breaks from this position here. The problem is when your partner comes forward, the hands are too close. You want about a 45 degree angle. That's about optimal where you have good breaking pressure, but you don't have the hands so close to your partner can just reach forward and grab them right away. We get in, we lock up like so, and from here we have our grips in place. Now, I'm going to talk to you about grips later on in the instructional, but for right now when you're first starting out with leg locks, you're not a master of them yet, the only grip that you should be using is palm to palm grips. There are other different grips that you can use, but it's very important that you use palm to palm grips in the beginning. I'll explain to you why later as we move further through the instructional. We're in position. We have strong back heel, knee heel together. We have our partner's far leg controlled, and from here we go in, we get that grip, we put our partner's heel right where our wristwatch would be. The further my partner's heel is towards my elbow, the more chance of slippage we have. I want the heel right where the wristwatch would be, and from here I want the hand that catches the heel pointing palm down. We go in, we lock our hands. We don't lock our hands like this, we don't lock our hands like this. We lock our hands palm to palm with no thumb, like so. Now from here, we take our elbow and we place it inside of our partner's shin. If our partner tries to heel slip from here, she can't because of the cantilever inside of my partner's shin, like so. If you're using a palm to palm grip, you can usually always get your elbow as close as you can to inside your partner's shin. If my partner goes to heel slip from here, it pulls my hands down. But when I have a wedge inside my partner's shin like so, it's going to be much harder for her to heel slip from here. Now when I go to break my partner, I don't want to be down on my shoulder, like so. This makes it easier for me to crunch my partner's toes into her butt, but it makes it easier for my partner to heel slip as well. So I want to be somewhere between my shoulder and my elbow, right about here. Now I lock everything up. We have a nice, about 45 degree angle bend in the leg, or somewhere between the elbow and the shoulder. And now from here, we get a strong back heel with our leg like so. It's not going to be as strong because my feet and ankles aren't behind my partner's butt, but you'll get enough power to break your partner from here. So back heel, I put my knees together and I point my knees down towards the floor. If my partner wants to go into a traditional rolling escape, she'll want to go and start moving in this direction. She'll want to roll out in this direction. So if her escape is east, my Ashi Gravi has to point west. So make it hard for her to roll. You can always tell which direction my Ashi Gravi is pointing in because of the ways that my knees point. If my knees are pointing out in this direction, her roll is in the exact opposite direction. If I go and I start pulling across in that direction, it leads her into motion. And as we know from previous instructionals, the number one enemy of submissions is my opponent being able to create motion towards an escape. I want to hold her in a static position long enough to break her. She wants to create motion towards an escape. She wants to create momentum. She wants to create movement. The number one enemy of submissions is always movement. I want to hold her in a static position long enough to break her. So we lock up. Everything comes into place. We get a strong back heel. Now from here, hips are up off the floor slightly. So my partner goes to roll to her left. It's going to be a very difficult thing to do. So number one is a back heel with my left heel. Number two, knees pinched together. Number three, I take my elbow and I use it to crunch my partner's toes down towards her butt. Number four, as I use that cheering motion where the toes come down to the butt and I pull my partner's heel up to my chin. And number five, from here, I take my chin down to my hands. The closer my chin is to my hands, the tighter the lock will be. The further my chin is from my hands, the weaker the lock will be. So I take my hands up as my chin comes down. And now from here, we finish with a bridge forward and I look over my left shoulder and we finish with a strong heel hook up and over like so. You notice that when everything comes into place, my partner's on breaking point right here and I still have all this motion left to go through. It's not going to be as strong as an outside heel hook, but it'll be strong enough to break your partner or at least get a defensive reaction where your partner has to start rolling or defending. Okay, so five major mechanics. We lock up, everything's in place. One, back heel. Two, knees come together. Three, I take her toes down to her butt. Four, I take her heel up to my chin. And five, hips come up and I start bridging. As I bridge, my chin and my hands never drift apart. I lose power here. My hands and my chin stay equidistant from one another the entire time. And as I'm going to bridge, we get strong finishes over the shoulder where we can go in, break our partner, and we get her rolling to switch to an Ashi Garami. So you can put a lot of pressure on your partner from this position and we get legitimate breaks provided you have the proper mechanics. So one is back heel. Two is knees coming together. Three is her toes to her butt. Four is her heel to your chin. And five is a bridge and looking over the bottom shoulder. Okay, so when you're drilling this, you should also stress test it because you don't have an Achilles grip anymore. You're going to be relying mostly or solely on your Ashi Garami to hold your partner in place. So when you switch from an Achilles grip to a heel hook, you should have your partner number one try to come forward and crush you. Okay? It's going to be hard for your partner to come forward and crush you provided you have the Ashi Garami set correctly. Like so, and provided your hands are high. If she comes forward and you have high hands, she'll break her own leg. And number two, you should have the Ashi Garami set correctly so that when your partner goes to walk away from you, she pulls you along the mat as if you're one person. And then the second she lands, you should still be tight enough on your partner to go in and break your partner right away. Okay? So when you're drilling this, you can have your partner try to come forward into you. It should be like if they come forward, they'll break their own leg because your hands are so high. When they got to move away from you, there's just no separation whatsoever. And the second they land, you're still connected. You can go belly down, go through your mechanics and get to a finish. So when you're drilling this, you should be able to stress test this where you have a partner try to not freak out, but move around a little bit and put you under some pressure and make sure that your Ashi Garami and all the mechanics are right. And then you can go in, you can control your partner as they try to move and then finish them when you're ready. All right, another thing your partner can do is they can come forward and try to heel slip. Okay? Now, like I said in the previous clip, your partner should feel like if they try to come forward because your hands are so high that they're going to break their own leg. If your hands are low, especially if your Ashi Garami isn't perfect, which a lot of times when you're training live against someone good, it won't be perfect. If your hands are low and your partner comes forward, they're going to heel slip. So what this will look like is we go in and we lock up a grip. My hands are low. I try to finish my partner. She comes forward and she heel slips out and I lose everything, which I just worked for. Okay? So we counter the heel slip by making sure that the second we lock up, we want our Ashi Garami set obviously. If the Ashi Garami is left less than perfect, then we're going to rely on our upper body position. So the second I lock up, I take my hands up nice and high. I take my chin down to my hands the best I can. When she goes to heel slip now, even when the Ashi Garami is loose, when she goes to heel slip, because the hands are so high, she'll actually break her own leg if she tries to come forward and heel slip. Okay? So it's very, very important the second you lock up that the hands immediately, the second my hands lock, my chin comes down, my hands come up. So now when she goes to come forward towards me, the heel will never slip. We can get strong breaks and go through the mechanics. Okay? So making sure the Ashi Garami is set properly and countering the heel slip by making sure that the second we lock, our hands immediately instinctually move into a situation where they're nice and high. We can go in, we'll lock up and get our finish. All right. So this time our partner comes forward, she manages to heel slip and I don't want to get crushed in this position. Okay? So as my partner come forward, she slips to heel and I'm like, oh man, this is no good. Now she's on top of me. What do I do from here? Just roll through and reboot the system. Okay? So the second I feel, and from here I lock up, my partner comes forward, she goes to heel slip and she actually gets the heel slip. I immediately transfer from a heel hook grip and the second she heel slips, I just follow her and we switch to an Achilles. So now as she goes to come forward and she's heel slipping, I just take my foot to the floor and I just point my toes to the ground. As she goes to come towards me, we just take our head between our partner's legs and now we have a choice of either one as she goes to come up on top of me, I can enter into a cross Ashi Grame situation like we showed before. Or we can just simply roll our partner through. So as she comes forward, we just roll our partner through into this position. We're now from here, we can determine what we're going to do. If my partner comes up to a knee, then we can go into Ashi Grame here. We can switch to an X guard, we can try to start throwing our leg across and reaping, which we'll look at later. There's many different things that we can do from here. If our partner falls back down to her butt from this scenario, then we just go right back to our Rimi Ashi Grame and we just reboot the system and go back to normal. Okay, so we have a couple of good options from here. From a Rimi Ashi Grame, I want you guys to come up and crush me. We get the initial heel hook grip, the heel slip is successful, she comes forward, we switch to an Achilles. Now as she goes to come up forward towards us, we either go one, we'll reinvert and our leg comes through. Now we can go to cross Ashi and lock up. Okay, and when we go to cross Ashi, we end up here. It's the easiest thing in the world to sit my partner down to her hip. We don't push towards her base, we just push out in this direction. It's the easiest thing, the directionality of force to get. We just go across my partner's body. So as she comes up on top of me, we just use either a pendulum or a full figure of four to just sit our partner down across the hip line. The directionality of force is always, I take my partner along her hips. That's the directionality of force. So when she gets the base out, go ahead, I just follow the hips, we can easily sit our partner down onto the ground. Okay, now this time, let's say she denies me the far leg. This time she comes forward, for whatever reason I can't get to that far leg from here. As she goes to come up and crush me, we just roll her partner through and we guide our partner on through like so. And now if she comes up to a knee, we can switch to X cord, we can go reverse X, we can start elevating our partner into cross Ashi, we can start reaping this leg across, we can do all kinds of things which we'll look at later. If we roll our partner through, come back, if we roll our partner through and she ends up back on her butt and we just reboot the system. So let's say we go in, we initially attempt to heal up our partner, she heel slips. She comes forward, we roll through and she ends up back on her butt. Whenever I see this, now we're just going to Rimi Ashi Garami, where now we can start looking to expose our partner's heel. Or if she turns this way, we follow. And now from here, we're back where we started and ready to go in and play the Achilles heel hook dilemma and go in for all of our attacks right from here. There's many different things we can do. So we counter the heel slip by rolling through underneath our partner by inverting and either going into a Kane Basami on our partner's far leg or just rolling through back to a Rimi Ashi Garami, rebooting the system and then going into attacks from there. Many times when you lock this initial grip, your partner's worried about a bunch of different things. Maybe they're posting their hands on the floor and trying to come up towards you to alleviate pressure. Maybe they're peeling your foot off of the hip. There's a lot of things that can be going on. And many times you can just take your leg out and switch from a Rimi Ashi Garami to outside Ashi Garami, which is where you want to be anyways in order to actually break your partner's leg. Okay? So I lock this up. I put in a heel hook. Many times from here, she's trying to drive forward and she has two hands on the floor. She takes pressure off like so. Whenever I see this, I just take my knee into my chest and I just fire it over. And now we're in outside Ashi Garami where we can get a deep fight behind our partner's hips and actually go and get much stronger breaks from here. Okay? Or maybe from here, we lock up. She goes to take my foot off the hip. And as she's doing that, she has one hand posted, she has one hand on my foot, and now actually that foot comes off. She goes to come and step over my leg. I block her at the hip and we switch to outside Ashi. And now we're ready to go in and get a strong break from an outside Ashi Garami. Okay? So there's a lot of times during these transitions where instead of rolling your partner through like we're going to do, this is the long version. Instead of rolling your partner through and having to go through the single roll theory and all these things that we're going to talk about, as your partner's fighting defensively, she's panicking because there is pressure on the heel hook and her hands aren't monitoring your inside leg. Whenever there's a chance, just switch your leg to the outside, switch to an outside Ashi, and then go into stronger breaking mechanics from the outside Ashi versus the Erimi Ashi Garami. Okay? So whenever you see the opportunity where this leg can sneak out, if her hands aren't monitoring this leg, if her knee is not closed and this leg's not stuck in any way, just take the leg out and just make a transition and go to outside Ashi. Whether it be with a full figure of four like so, or whether it be with crossed ankles like so. We'll go through the pluses and minuses, the pros and cons of the leg configurations later. Okay? All right, so a lot of times when we lock an outside heel hook from Erimi Ashi Garami, your partner tries to roll through. You see these matches where people roll, roll, roll, roll, roll. There's six or seven rolls that go out of bounds. They hit a table and they reset, or they roll until they create enough motion to free the knee and kind of corkscrew their way out and end up back in a neutral position. All right? What we're operating with is something we call the single roll theory, where your partner can only roll through one time and no more. And this all depends on the precision of the directionality of force of your Ashi Garami. Your Ashi Garami will determine how many times and how fast your partner can roll. And it's super important that your directionality of force of the Ashi Garami is very precise. Okay? So from this position, we lock up. The second we lock up, our partner goes to explosively roll out. Okay? As my partner goes to roll out from here, we go in and we lock up our hands. She goes to roll. The second she goes to roll, I immediately take my leg and I reap it across and I create a strong connection of my leg to her leg. Okay? And I want to stay here and have all this daylight. I want to take my leg and I want to reap it across and create a strong connection like so. Now, from here, as she goes to roll, I point my knee at the floor. And again, we have that stress test. When she goes to pull her leg out, even with no hands, she won't be able to pull herself free. Okay? Now, from here, we lock up. Our hands are locked as they should have been already. And now, I follow my partner through and we switch to outside Ashi Garami on the opposite side. As we do so, I make sure I don't pose to my elbow and come up like so. This will inhibit my ability to roll. It's like if you're trying to roll a tree through your yard and it has branches on it, it'll be impossible. Versus if you cut the branches off, you'll roll very easily. So, I don't pull myself up onto my elbow like you think would help you. From this position, she goes to roll through. We roll through and just as we're about belly down, we take our leg out and we lock into an outside Ashi Garami like so. So that our hips are connected to our partner's hips. We have a very good bend in the leg, a good connection with the hands. And now, our Ashi Garami points in the exact opposite direction of her next roll, which is in this direction. So, when she goes to roll a second time, the Ashi Garami stops her from rolling a second time. And now from here, we can go in, hold her in a static position long enough to get a strong break and we can go through our breaking mechanics and actually finish our partner. This is the single roll theory, where she can roll one time from an Erimi Ashi Garami, but no more. And the reason she can't roll a second time is because when I land, my Ashi Garami is pointing in the exact opposite direction of her escape. Okay? So now, when my knees point down towards the floor out to my left, when she tries to roll to my right, it's just not going to happen from here. Okay? So once again, we have an Erimi Ashi Garami. My partner goes to roll through. As she goes to roll through, she tries to pull her leg free. She can't do it from here. From here, once my knee hits the floor, my left knee comes down. Okay? Left knee comes down. My right knee comes to my chest. I freeze my leg. And now I just sit back towards my partner's hips. So I land hip to hip. Once I land hip to hip, my feet cross and I point my knees down towards the floor. When she goes to roll a second time, it's just not going to happen from here. And now from here, we have a strong Aosai Ashi Garami, ready to break our partner with good breaking mechanics from Aosai Ashi. Okay, so what this will look like is when she goes to explosively roll two times. Go ahead. She can't roll a second time. So we lock up our legs in good position. And now from here, we're ready to go in and start breaking our partner. Okay? So this is a single roll theory. You roll through one time. You make sure your Ashi Garami points in the opposite direction of her escape. Okay? So we're making sure we land hip to hip. What I don't want is this. We roll through. As we roll through, I land somewhere out here. See how the knee's almost out now? I want to push myself back towards my partner's hips as I go. She rolls through. Knee comes in. Hips come back. Then we lock. Now she goes to roll. She can't. I'm hip to hip, and I can break. Many times when we're in a Rimi Ashi Garami, before I get a heel hook, before I need that, my partner will build up to a knee, like so. Or maybe I'll knock her down from standing position, and she ends up on a knee. Whenever I see this, I want to dominate the space between my partner's two knees. Okay? So as she goes to come forward towards me, I have this Achilles strip here, and of course I have my Ashi Garami in place. I take a false grip on my partner's knee, and now from here, I open my right knee. As I open my right knee, it makes space for my left heel to track my right knee and follow it across as I pull my partner's knee across to my right hip, like so. You can even threaten knocking your partner down in the opposite direction, so she closes her knee towards you. A lot of times when I try to reap, she opens up her right knee, and I can't do it. So I threaten an off balance in this direction. She has to point the knee, and as she points the knee, we come across like so. The second the knee comes across, we immediately go to that cowboy drill. Let me catch. Now when she goes to turn back, because of the leg position, because of the heel hook grip with the high hands, she'll break her own leg. She can't do it. And now we use that single roll theory. She goes to explosively roll out. We land an outside ashi Garami with our heel ready to go in and break our partner. Okay? So whether she builds to a knee, or come up, or whether she's standing, let's say I use an ashi Garami, I go to knock her down, and she falls not to her butt, but to her shin, like so. Whenever I see this, we just go in and we catch. I actually use this on Roosevelt in my 2022 semifinals match in ADCC. He was standing, but same idea. From here, I look to pull everything across. If I can't, I off balance out in one direction to threaten a sweep. If she does nothing, she falls down. So what she has to do is she has to point the knee back towards me. As I go to off balance and open the knee, she closes the knee, and that allows me to go in, open up the right knee, and as I open the right knee, the left heel follows. Now we catch. We lock up. She goes to roll through. We land up an outside ashi, and now we're ready to go in and break our partner. So my partner's posting on a knee. We had a Kazushi in one direction if we have to, then we reap, we roll our partner through, and then we end up in Atsu ashi using the single roll theory. All right, so many times, because body weight isn't involved here, it's hard to get my partner to actually roll through. They're willing to take a few pops here and there and then stay in their knee, knowing that if they roll through, they get fully broken, whereas if they stay in the knee, they'll just get popped a little bit, and they can at least fight out. Whenever I see this, where my partner comes to a knee, I expose my partner's heel, and from here, my partner won't roll through. She's turning back towards me, like so. I end up here, where I can get pressure on my partner's leg, but I can't actually break her. From this position, we just use an extension of our left leg to push our partner's hands down towards the mat, and then we just flare our right leg out, and we kick our right leg free. She will always be trying to come towards me to turn back into me, and then peel my foot off the hip to alleviate pressure. So what I do, the second I feel my partner's giving me resistance and won't turn, I just give a small push, and push my partner out and away. Maybe it won't push her hands all the way to the floor, but what it'll do is it'll off-balance her, and it'll take her out and away. So I have room now for my right leg to come through, and then fire over into a deep fight with my right leg. And now from here, we go in and we lock a full figure of four. When I lock the full figure of four, my heels come down towards the floor, I splay my knees open, and I lift my hips. When she goes to roll now, it's going to be incredibly difficult, because as she goes to roll, my knees are splayed open, and now I start pointing my knees in the opposite direction of her roll, to my left. So now when she goes to roll through, it becomes a very difficult thing because she's carrying my full body weight. And now from here, we can go into our breaking mechanics. So from here, I expose my partner's heel, I get a good bite, maybe I pop her a few times, but she's turning back into me, she's trying to peel the foot off, she's taking her time from here. Whenever I see this, the second I see her going to turn back towards me, we just push out and away, and we make space. Now from here, we fire our leg over, this is not something that I do very slow. We just immediately push, we pull our knee in. I don't flare my knee and have her pull her leg out completely. I pull my knee in and I keep my knee pointing towards the ceiling so I have a wedge the whole time around my partner's knee. So if she tries to explode out, it's a difficult thing. Now we figure four. From this position, if she straightens her leg, it turns into a heel knee bar. So she's never going to do that. She's always going to keep a bend in the leg from here. From here, we flare the knees, the hips come up, and now we point the knees out to our left. When she goes to roll, it's not going to be an easy thing because she's carrying body weight, and then the break becomes very easy from there. Now we get to this position where we're belly up like so. We saw breaking mechanics from a Rimi Ashi when we're belly down, the breaking mechanics when we're belly up are different. The belly down and belly up mechanics are different from here. When I'm belly up, you can get breaks by crunching your partner's toes in towards their butt. The problem is, especially when it's sweaty, you run into slippage problems where I go to crunch and the heel starts slipping up the forearm into the crease of the elbow and it slips off. So the much better way to break your partner instead is to actually open in the opposite direction and bring everything away from my partner's butt. So I hit a strong back heel, I bring my hips up and I splay my knees. Now from here, I point my knees in the opposite direction of her escape. As I do so, I look to straighten the leg by taking my left elbow and opening in an arc over my head. So as my knees point in one direction, my elbow opens in the opposite direction and that gets an almost straightened leg and incredibly strong breaks. If you watch Gary Tona versus Lucas Valete, he did this with an inverted heel hook and it's actually the one that taps him and actually just completely breaks his leg in half from Cross Ashi Garami, I believe it is, and just absolutely destroys his leg, his belly up. The belly up mechanics are very different. So we lock up from here, we lock up everything in place. Now the hips come up and the knees splay. I point my knees left as my elbow, my left elbow opens up over my head towards my right and that is what gives me strong breaks. My hips come forward, knees point and I have two opposing directions. My upper body points west as my lower body points east and from here we get incredibly strong finishes with outside heel hooks. So instead of crunching in like so and having slippage issues, we open. Once you go to slip the heel now, it's just not going to happen because I'm moving in the opposite direction and this gives us incredibly strong breaking power. The whole thing is the hips come forward towards my partners like so. The knees are splayed. Now the knees point and now the second I open my hands up and over my head, I do a side crunch to my right, put your partner on breaking point instantly. That's what we're looking for here. So we have belly up mechanics which are very different from belly down mechanics. We're going to start, I'm going to go into a little intro into Asada Ashi. I want to go into the breaking mechanics because we've been doing breaking mechanics and they're so similar to the Irimi Ashi Garami breaking mechanics when you're down on your side. I just want to run through the breaking mechanics so that if you guys do lock outside heel hooks and you're watching this, you have the breaking mechanics. So if you do get into Asada Ashi Garami, you can actually go in and break your partner's leg right away because we're going to go into control methods. We're going to go into an intro and then the differences between Irimi Ashi Garami and Asada Ashi Garami and then control methods from Asada Ashi, how to not get your back taken, things like that. But I want you to have the breaking mechanics right off the bat so that if you do lock a heel hook from Asada Ashi, you can actually break your partner's leg. So from here, we roll our partner through, whether it be with a single roll theory, whatever the case is, we end up in Asada Ashi. When I have my partner in Asada Ashi Garami, again, I always want to have my form aligned with my partner's foot like so. I want to have the heel right where the wrist watch would be. And I want the toes preferably in the crease of the bicep. Now this won't always be how it's going to happen. Sometimes you'll have the toes up in the armpit like so, but the toes need to be anywhere from the armpit down to the bicep. But the bicep is preferable and the heel right where the wrist watch would be is preferable. Now there are going to be five major mechanics we run through as we look to go in and start breaking our partner. When I have an Asada Ashi Garami, I have my feet triangle behind my partner's hips like so most of the time. There's a couple of different ways that we can go in and actually break our partner from here and we'll talk about the ways we can triangle our legs later. But we have our two legs to the outside and we have the ability to back heel and to pull our partner's hips in towards us. So as I'm crunching my partner's toes down to her butt, I'm also simultaneously pulling her butt in towards her toes. And this gives me a lot more power to break my partner's leg. So we lock up, realistically when we go in and we're in a live situation, we lock up our hands like so. And again, we put that elbow inside of our partner's shin the best we can and we bring our hands up nice and high and we take our chin down to our hands. This is where we want to be. Now if your hands are high and your chin is low, you won't be able to actually get through the full range of mechanics before you break your partner's legs. So I'm just going to unlock my hands and just hold my partner in like so from this position. So from here, first mechanic is we take our heels to our butt and we pull our partner's hips in. That makes it tighter. Two, is you take our knees and we pinch them together with emphasis on the top knee coming down towards the floor. That makes it tighter. Three, again, we want that same 45 degree angle or so on my partner's leg. We don't want to be too close so she can access my hands and we don't want to be too straight because then it's hard to break. So three, I take my partner's toes and I just crunch them down towards her butt. Four, I take the heel and I pull it up to my chin like so. And five, from here, the hips come off the ground slightly, the hips come forward, and then from here I bridge over my bottom shoulder and the hands and the chin stay equally distant from one another the entire time. Okay, so five major mechanics. A strong back heel, knees coming together, crunch your toes to her butt, pull her heel to your chin, and then finally bridge over the bottom shoulder. The true test of whether or not you have strong mechanics is by using one hand to break. So I have this hand out here just floating around. If I can break my partner with one hand by just putting the mechanics in, and the second I go to bridge and put her on breaking point here, but just with one hand, if I go any further than this I'll break her leg. If you can break your partner with one hand, you know the mechanics are good. You shouldn't have to use all these varying grips that we're going to look at later in order to break your partner. So if you're stress testing this, if I want to go in and I want to say, oh hey, how are my outside heel hook mechanics? I should be able to go in and just immediately put my partner on breaking point right from here with one hand. So the second I go to even bridge, or I go to do anything and move anything, my partner immediately is ready to break. And that means when I lock up, the lock gets twice as tight and we can go in and get incredibly strong breaks on our partner. You see that when I lock everything up, the mechanics come in tight. She's on breaking point here. If I go any further than right here, she'll break. I still have all of this range of motion to go through. So I just wanted to run through those breaking mechanics. It's very similar to a Rimi Ashi Garami, but we have the extra pull of our partner's hips behind us or towards us with that strong back heeling motion and pinching of the knees. So you have to make sure, the big mistake everyone makes is they either focus too much in the lower body and the upper body grips are poor, the hands are away from the chin, or they focus so much in the upper body grips that the lower body Ashi Garami is loose and you lose your partner's leg, the knees aren't pinched together, there's no back heel, and then your partner slips out or you don't break your partner. You need to have a good combination of the lower body grips in place with the Ashi Garami and a combination of the upper body grips doing the work to actually go through and break your partner successfully.
