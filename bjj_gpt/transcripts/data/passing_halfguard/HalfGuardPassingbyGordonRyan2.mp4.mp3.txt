 So this time we scoop our partner's ankle and when I have this ankle scoop my partner has no ability to actually lock her legs anymore to control my leg. So she's down, we're in this ankle scooping position, this over back grip. This time instead of flattening my partner out I just want to go right into a back step. So from here the first thing I make sure I do is I take my left knee in this case, my free leg, and I just blade it right into my partner's hip. So that from here, if at any point I lose this ankle scoop and I go to back step, what I don't want is my knee being out here somewhere, where from here she slides her knee in quickly she can expose my back. I always want to make sure that my knee is connected to the pocket of my partner's hip here. So if at any point I lose this and she goes to start taking my back she can never get that bottom knee to the inside. So I scoop this ankle, we have our legs in position. When she goes from here, so you start stopping me from back step and she goes to control my legs with hers, it's the easiest thing in the world to just take my foot straight up and pommel it through. If her foot's on the floor, I can do a quick back step like so. If her foot follows me, then I just hit a front pommel like so. And now from here wherever she goes to move, it's a hard thing. Even if she tries to freak out internal from here, it's a hard thing to do from here. Actually I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure I hit this in my Jacob Couch match for a portion of the match. I'm pretty sure I had this ankle scoop when we were wrestling but I'm not 100% positive. And now from here wherever she goes to move from here, it's a pretty hard thing for her to do. Now all I have to do is I open my elbow up as I lean towards my partner's hip with the intention of shelving her right leg on my right leg like so. And now from here before I release the ankle scoop, when she goes to move her bridge from here, she only has one leg to do it with. So before I release the ankle scoop, I switch to a cross face. And now if I can get to an underhook, I go to my underhook. If I can't get to an underhook, my partner's turning towards me, she's doing a good job stopping me. Instead, I'll walk right to north-south. So if I feel like I can't get an underhook, we'll go in one, flatten our partner out, we'll take our hand across and we'll move to north-south so our partner can't turn and start reguarding. Okay, so whenever I see I get to this ankle scoop position and we're in here, we can start a back stepping game. Where I go to back step, if her foot's down, I just back step out. If her foot's up, I go to back step, I can't do it, I front pommel and we're through. Now wherever she goes to move from here, you'll see it's a difficult thing to do. With a gi, it's like the most annoying thing ever because you actually have a grip on the fabric. And now from here, wherever she goes to move, I just lift and shell. And now, if you go to an underhook and cross face, or many times she's trying to turn into me to avoid a score, block the hips, we walk to north-south and start passing right from there. Okay, so using a back step off of this ankle scoop, so your partner can't lock the ankles anymore, we just back step out or front pommel out and then we can easily start to pass our partner in various ways from there. All right, so instead of back stepping into side control, this time we can step right over into a mounted position. So let's take a look at how we do this. We use this ankle scoop, we go in, we move to control our partner's ankle like so. This time, what we're going to do is we're going to start crowding our partner's hips. And now from here, we're going to slide the ankle scoop up to our partner's shoelaces. What we're doing here is we're baiting our partner to extend the leg to try to free the foot. What she wants is for the foot to slip out and for that to happen. So from here, I move from the ankle up to the shoelaces and I catch on just the toes like so. And now I just take my partner's knee and I put it between my two legs here. I just float like so. Now as my partner goes to slip that foot through, she goes to pull her knee up to her chest. And as she does so, I take a big step up and over my partner's hips like so. Now from here, because I have such a good connection of my left knee to my partner's hip, she can't dominate the inside elbow position. If my knee, we just switch sides, there's a mirror image. If my knee is out here somewhere and she can take her elbow inside, she can knee elbow escape the second I step to mount. But because as I mentioned before, we did such a good job of keeping our knee glued to our partner's hip, when she goes to knee elbow escape, it won't happen from here. And now it's the easiest thing in the world to go in, start cross-facing our partner, pointing her head in the opposite direction of the direction she wants to escape. And now from here we can punch underhooks and start moving into our attacks from top pins right away. So from here, we go in, we threaten this ankle scoop, and now from here we just play a game where we loosen it up. Over time, we move to our partner's shoelaces. That from here, she goes to give one last push and as the foot goes to slip out, we let it go, we take a big step over into mounted position. Now from here, she goes to knee elbow escape, I pinch my knees together. What I don't want is for her to steal the inside elbow position. She can do this by taking her elbow inside my knee physically, or she can also do it by moving her hips away from my knee. Now she can steal the inside position. So I control my partner's hips by pinching my two knees together. So when she goes to move away and shrimp, she can no longer do so. And now from here, we put a strong cross-face in place, we pull our partner towards us, we flatten her out, and then we slide our knee up nice and high to steal the inside knee position relative to a partner's elbows, and then we start walking hands up and over. This time, we move that ankle scoop to a shoelace scoop where you control your partner long enough and then you feel like, okay, it's time to let her go. She thinks, oh, I'm going to slip out now. And as the foot slips out, we take a big step into mount, and then we go into a cross-face, flatten our partner out, and start attacking right from there. All right, now let's look at leg riding with this ankle scoop. There's a couple of different ways we can do this. First is with our backstep method. We go in, we start ankle scooping, we backstep out, and now our partner tries to point her knees towards us. Okay, so she's trying to turtle, she's trying to point the knee towards us, so I can't go in and pass from this position. Whenever I see this, we just take our knee and we just cover our partner's knee like so. So I take my knee and I just pinch my partner's two knees together from here. From this position, it's a pretty hard thing from here for my partner to start moving around. If I just had the ankle scoop, my partner can pump the knee and start moving the knee around and create a lot of motion and free the knee. So from here, I just use an extra degree of control, an extra wedge in place by just taking my knee and just covering my partner's knee like so. So when she gets to move around now, the entire leg's controlled. When she starts to freak out and spaz around, it's a very hard thing from here. It doesn't look like much, but this is the difference between controlling someone and having them move out of the way and freak out and spaz away. If I control just the lower leg with the ankle scoop and I pass and I have no control of the legs besides the ankle scoop, she just pumps the legs aggressively and moves around and gives me problems. So I backstep and I move to this position. When she gets to move from here, it's 10 times as hard for her to move because now I'm controlling the upper and the lower leg. And now from here, I wait for her to freak out. She gets to move around and then on my terms, I shelf the leg. So one is I physically backstep and I control my partner through a leg-grinding scenario where I pinch my knees like so. She gets to move around. Even if I try to hold her without the leg position, tight, tight, tight, go ahead, it gets kind of sloppy. If I'm in half guard and she goes to do that same thing, I just flatten her out. So from here, once I disengage the leg, she can now scissor her legs and move around much more with much more movement. The second I backstep, I go into a leg ride. She gets to freak out now. I wait for that initial explosion. Now I pass. Conversely, this time, I start leg riding while I'm in her half guard. So instead of backstepping out and controlling, from this position, we just go in and we just control our partner's knee right from here. She goes to move around now. There's just nowhere she can go. And now from here, I move up to my partner's shoelaces. I start walking towards my partner's legs. From this position, we take our heel and we just use it to lift our partner's bottom leg and swish her, our ankle underneath. The biggest danger when we pass to mount, besides in the elbow escape, is ankle exposure. If she can take my ankle in and catch, she can push me into half guard on the opposite side. So I take the extra five seconds, 10 seconds. Remember, your partner's freaking out from here. You're not using any energy. She's about to get passed. So from here, we go in. We control our partner's knee like so. We start sliding up towards the shoelaces. Now from here, we use our right heel to start leaning forward and lifting our partner's bottom leg. And we swish our left leg under. So now, when she goes to expose my ankle when I pass, she won't be able to. In addition, when she goes to move her legs, she can't move anywhere. Now from here, I just slide up to the toes. I let my partner's legs slip out and as it does, we just step right over. Because of the fact that my left leg is in this position, when she goes to trap my ankle, there's no ankle exposure. Because of the fact that my left foot now is underneath my partner's legs. If it was here, she'd be able to expose my ankle much more easily. So before I go in, I move into this position here. So now when she goes to expose my ankle, much more difficult. So I can leg ride from this position. After I backstep, I can control like so. Or before I backstep. Now when she goes to move around, it's difficult. I take my time. I want to hide my left ankle from here. So from this position, I lift. I slide my left ankle underneath. And now I just start sliding up towards my partner's toes. From this position, she goes to move around. Now from here, I slide up. I'm ready to go. And we can hide our ankle from being exposed. The absolute worst case scenario, my partner exposes my ankle. No problem. Now we're right back in. We're passing three-quarter mount. We can expose our partner's back. We can pass from here. We can work from three-quarter mount. We'll look at that in a second. So two great options. One, we can go in. I have two great options, one, backstepping right from here, leg riding, controlling the upper and the lower leg. She goes to move around. There's nowhere to go. From here, we start leg riding inside our partner's legs. And now from here, she goes to start moving around. We walk, everything flat. Now from here, we move into a situation where we can move to the upper body if we want to. We can put a cross face in right away if we want to. Or we can stay with the overback grip. And now from here, she goes to move around. And it's just so difficult for her to get anything going. We can start using that ankle scoop, start stepping over to mount, leg riding before or after we pass the legs. It gives us more degree of control, and then we can pass right from there. You're looking at this position, and you're probably like, okay, well, this ankle scoop is great if you can get it, but is anyone really going to let me scoop the ankle while the heel is connected to the butt? If you do it a few times, the answer is no, probably not. But you have to understand that if you get this grip, your partner's in real danger of having that guard passed. Okay? This is a very robust grip, and if you can actually get the ankle scoop, you can put a lot of heat on your partner. So what everyone starts doing is they say, okay, well, if he gets the ankle scoop, I'm going to be in trouble. So they deny you the ankle scoop. And there's two ways that they can do this. Number one is from this overback grip. I go to scoop, they extend the leg. They push the knee away from the chest. Number two, as I go to scoop, they open up the knee. So that hurt my elbow physically comes inside the knee, and now from here, I can't scoop the ankle anymore. Okay? We're going to look at two ways to deal with this. First we go in, I start scooping, going in for the ankle scoop. My partner aggressively extends the knee away and extends the leg. Now this brings us right back to the beginning. In order for my partner not to get flattened out, she has to keep the inside knee relative to my hip. If I try to flatten my partner out from here, I come onto that frame. So I deal with this by threatening an ankle scoop. If she gives me the ankle scoop, I just start passing from here. So what everyone does is they're like, man, I don't want my heel glued to my butt for this entire pass. So what they do is they extend the leg away, stopping the ankle scoop, but now she forsakes the inside knee position. So now I take my right knee, I slide it across. Now we're back to square one, where now we can come in, start working to the upper body inside position and flattening our partner out chest to chest. Okay? This is super, super, super simple. But it makes all the difference using this ankle scoop. Okay? Because now we come full circle back to square one, where your partner just willingly takes the knee out and you're like, well, why did they do that? Well, because if they don't, you're going to go into the ankle scoop series and pass the guard anyways. And you have much more degree of control with the ankle scoop than you do with anything else. So from here, I sit to this over back grip. I try to go for the ankle scoop. If she gives me it, I'm more or less guaranteed to pass at least her legs from here. So what everyone does is they either extend the leg or they open up the knee. From here, she extends the leg, now we can flatten our partner out and start working. Okay? So we play this game between if my partner, she'd be playing the level game. If my partner keeps the knee in, we play an ankle scoop series. If we play an ankle scoop series, she gets passed. If she denies me the ankle scoop and she moves the knee out of position and my hip comes to the inside position relative to her knee, then I just flatten my partner out. Okay? Now we're going to look at a second option, moving into three quarter mount when she opens her knee and denies me the ankle scoop. All right. So this time we go to scoop the ankle and instead of extending the leg, my partner opens up the knee. Okay? So what this will look like as we looked at before, I go to go in, scoop, she opens up the knee. And now from here, I have a couple of great options. I can either go for a scoop grip and throw the pass from there, which we'll look at soon. Or I can just take the inside elbow position. So from here, I can either flatten my partner out. So obviously that's a choice where if she opens up the knee, I try to scoop the ankle. I can just go in and go over my partner's hip and flatten my partner out as we did previously. But because there's so much space and my partner's hip is so exposed, it makes it a great time for me to slide right into three quarter mount instead of just accepting half guard. If you want to accept half guard, you can, but because my partner's knee is so open, it's pretty easy thing to slide the three quarter mount. If she just extends her leg, I can slide the three quarter mount, but sometimes if she's pinching her knees together, it's hard for me to free my knee right away. But if she opens up the knee, now my knee comes right through. So in general, this is just a very general line of thought here. If I try to go for the ankle scoop, my partner extends the leg, I generally settle with flattening her out in half guard. If I go to take the ankle scoop and she opens the knee, I generally take the inside elbow. And now from here, I just immediately take my head across, I slide my knee through, and I immediately put my knee on the floor and my hands plant. Now from here, what I don't want is her pushing my knee back into half guard. So the second I put my knee on her fore hip, I backstep, I land on her legs, then I sit into this position here, where I blade my right knee, in this case, into her hip, and I keep my weight over her legs. I take my opposite elbow and I place it behind her hips. When she goes to scoot away, there's nowhere she can move. When she goes to open up those legs, there's nowhere she can go. And now from here, I play a game and I start working. If at any point my partner builds to an elbow, which you probably wouldn't, but she does, we just go in, we take a knee inside underhook, which is best, we can flatten our partner out and start passing with a knee inside underhook. More than likely, she's going to be trying to get an inside elbow inside like so. So I play a game, we go in and we cross face. As I cross face, from here, I pull my partner towards me and I put my forehead on the floor on the opposite side. This puts an immense amount of pressure on my partner. And now from here, when she goes to start knee-elbow escaping, it's a very difficult thing. From this position, we keep our knee on the inside and we just use a butterfly hook inside. When she goes to move around from here, it's just not going to happen. And now from this position, if at any point her elbow comes inside of your knee and you feel like you can't mount without getting the elbow escape, I just pommel across to a shin mount. And now from here, we make a choice of what we're going to do. Most of the time, with a shin mount, we start coming in, start switching to a cross face on this side. Now my partner goes to move me around. We can usually punch underhooks in and make transitions between top pins. If, on the other hand, my partner, as I go to pass, my partner's elbow comes outside of my knee, then I just slide my knee right up into the armpit and I stay on the inside position. And now from here, when she goes to knee-elbow escape, she can't because she doesn't have any inside position, and I can easily go in, slide my other knee up, and pass straight to a mounted position. So I'm looking at my knee position relative to my partner's elbow. We went over this a lot in the first passing instructional, so I'm not going to spend a ton of time on it now, but that's the general idea from here. So whenever I see my partner avoids me scooping the ankle by opening up the knee, I take an elbow inside, and immediately I drive my knee through this giant gap that she's now created for me. Here, and we end up here. I backstep, weight onto my partner's legs, and I wedge her hips in place. She goes to move around from here, it's not going to be easy. From this position, we go in, we hit a crossface. As we hit the crossface, we flatten our partner out, and we put our forehead on the floor. If at any point we try to crossface, and she takes her hand up to block the crossface, now I just slide my knee up into her armpit, and I steal the inside knee position. So now when she goes to take that elbow back inside, she can't. And now from here, I play a pummeling game, it's a waiting game now. I play a pummeling game, she goes to move around and stop me. I can always eventually get to the inside, and now I can flatten my partner out, putting my forehead on the floor. She goes to move around from here, I have the inside knee position. She goes to move around from here, and there's just nowhere that she can go, I can easily take them out of the position. If on the other hand, her elbow dominates the inside position relative to my knee the whole time, we go in, we crossface. From here, we free our leg like we usually do, she goes to move around, and goes to shin mount on the opposite side. Now she goes in, she goes to face me, I can play a game where I start going in, I start threatening gi teeps, I start threatening kimuras, I can start moving into shin, cross shin pins, I can move back into the legs if I want to. And now from here, I can play with a bunch of different combinations, which we're going to look at. We're going to look at actually in this position, we're going to look at passing 2.0. This is a very interesting position we're going to look at here. But there's a bunch of different varieties of things that we can do from here. The main thing is getting past your partner's legs, and then moving from pin to pin, side control, mount, north-south, and navigating your waist through the top pins, which I showed in attacking from top pins, side control, north-south, and then mount. The main thing is passing from 3.25 mount into some kind of top pin and then attacking from there. But again, in general, with the ankle scoops, if I go to scoop the ankle and they extend the leg, I generally prefer flattening the mount and half guard, taking my time and working from there. If they open up the knee, there's so much space between the knees now, the hip is so exposed, I generally prefer taking an inside elbow, sliding across the 3.25 mount, and then passing from there. There's just general rules I like to follow, but you can play around with it, and it's different in every situation, so don't hold me to those rules, but just general ideas to play with when you're working in this position. All right, so now we looked at hip switching to an overback grip. Now we're going to look at hip switching to a reverse underhook. Whether it be hip switch to an overback or a reverse underhook, your partner can pommel their hand to move into different various positions, and you have to understand the difference between these two positions, the dangers associated with them. When I hip switch past this initial top knee shield, and we're here, and however I get to this overback grip, if I hip switch above my partner's shoulder, and I move to this overback grip like so, the main danger of my partner looking to off-balance me is with a bridge knocking me backwards to my hip in this direction. If I hip switch to a reverse underhook like so, or my partner, for whatever reason, takes the hand through and forces me to a reverse underhook, now the main danger isn't knocking me backwards in this direction anymore, it's actually pushing me down the body. It's a combination of bridging me to off-balance me in this direction, so bridge this way to get my knee out of position, and then a combination of that and pushing me down the body to bring this bottom knee in and start to expose my back. So she's going to go in two different directions based on where my grip is relative to her shoulder line. If I move to this overback grip and my elbow is well above her shoulder line, she can't push me down the body from here. She has no pushing grips. So what she's going to look to do is start bridging me and taking me out in this direction to off-balance me. If I go to a reverse underhook and my elbow is well below her shoulder line, now it's hard for her to get a strong bridge to knock me over. If she tries to actually bridge me over from here, she can't. But what she can do is she can bridge me to off-balance me, and then as I get off-balanced, she can bring that knee in, a lot of times she'll sit up to her right elbow, take her own overback grip, and now from here, she'll use that to start bridging me, getting the knee free, and now she can start to expose my back and push me down the body. So in one scenario, she's bridging me and pushing me up over the head to knock me down to a hip, and in the other, she's starting with an initial kazushi and pushing me down towards the hips to bring this bottom knee in and at least recover and potentially expose my back. So we have to look at this, and from this reverse underhook scenario, we have to look at ways from here that we can keep our partner pinned in place long enough to go into our guard passes and attacks from here. Okay, so we're going to look at now passing from a reverse underhook, we looked at passing from an overback grip, now we're going to go into passing from a reverse underhook and look at the little subtle differences between the two. Alright, so now when we start going into this reverse underhook scenario, our leg position becomes more important. Now this is semi-important when you go to an overback grip, but it's much more important when I sit to this reverse underhook. So when I sit to this reverse underhook, in a situation like so, my partner from here is going to be looking to try to off-balance me and just enough backwards in this direction to get me to base out with this knee. If I base out with this knee, now because she can take her own overback grip, the chance of her exposing my back becomes much higher. Whereas from here, from above the shoulder line, now there's no danger of me, of her exposing my back. So I can play this same leg position, which we're going to talk about in a second, I can play this same leg position here, but it's not nearly as important because of the fact that there's not nearly as much back exposure from here. Whereas if she can take her own overback grip from this reverse underhook, now this becomes super important. So the leg position is this. I'm going to turn my hips just as I was before, putting my hips close to the ground, and then blade my left knee into my partner's bottom hip. And now from here, I'm going to pull my leg, my right leg and right heel back in the opposite direction. So I'm shooting my left knee forward and I'm pulling my right leg back. I'm scissoring my legs from here. So now when she goes to off-balance me from here, I'm hooked in, I'm anchored into my partner's legs. When she goes to free that bottom knee, there's tension running through the bottom leg. So when she goes to move me around from here, it's not an easy thing. If she sits up and takes her own overback grip, her whole thing from here, if there's no tension, is to put a foot on the floor to give a strong bridge, get me to base my leg out, and then quickly whip the bottom knee through and expose my back. So my whole thing from here is to keep that bottom leg wedge in place. So I shoot my left knee into the pocket of my partner's bottom hip right here. And now as I do that, I sit and I turn and I pull my right heel back to my butt and I shoot my right leg back and I scissor my legs from here. So now from this reverse underhook, when she goes to move me around, even if she puts a foot on the floor and bridges, she can't move me anywhere. And now it's a pretty easy thing for me to start working from here. So this leg position, you can use it from the overback grip as well, but understand the importance. If she goes to hit a strong bridge from here, it'll do a pretty good job of keeping you wedge in place. But it's not as important because of the fact that there's no back exposure. Whereas if I have a reverse underhook, now she has access to her own overback grip. And now this is what's dangerous. If I get off balance now, my knee comes out of position and it moves out of the pocket of her hip. Now she has access to my back and this is no good. So from this reverse underhook, the leg position becomes far more important than from the overback grip. So I put left knee to bottom hip and I hit a strong back heel and I scissor my legs in this position so that whenever she goes to move around from here, it's a very difficult thing to off balance me. So it has to be tension running through the legs and you have to be wedging the bottom leg in place to make sure that bottom knee doesn't come out and create at least an escape and potentially even back exposure for her. All right, so let's start talking about moving into this reverse underhook situation where from here we go in, move to this reverse underhook and we sit into this position. The main issue I'm going to face is my partner looking to start trying to free this bottom knee. Now your partner will a long time do this by looking to bridge me this way and then bringing the knee in, but a lot of times my partner can also look to just take two hands, which is actually a pretty common reaction, and look to just start pushing me down the body like this. They'll start pushing exactly the same in their arms and then from here they'll start trying to shrimp away and then they'll bring the bottom knee in and I'll force you to square up and the knee will come in. Whenever I see someone giving me a hard time with either pushing me down the body or trying to bridge me in this direction to off balance me, a scoop grip is another great way to control my partner's body and legs. I can show my partner's bottom leg through proper leg position like so. I can control my partner's top leg through this scoop grip. So from here I'm just going to take a hand to the floor, I'm just going to pop up and I'm going to put a shin across my partner's hips like so. So now I have that same leg position, this time my shoelaces are wedging against my partner's bottom hip and I pull my right leg back like so and now I shoot my left knee forward to my partner's top hip. I dominate my partner's entire hip line. And in addition I pull with tension with my right hand, pull my right elbow back to my own hip. So now it seems like a pretty unstable position but once she goes to move around from here, she can't push me, she can't pull me, she can't move anywhere from this position. And now I dominate the space between my partner's knees. When she goes to pinch her knees together, she can't do it because of the scoop grip. Now from here it's a pretty easy thing to just take my leg and back step it through. Once my leg is back stepped through there's a variety of different things we can do from here. So if I want to go back into submissions I can place my leg to the inside, I can go into cross ashi and start attacking your partner's legs from here. If I want to go into passes, it's a pretty easy thing. I'm going to start going in and either one, pull my partner's legs down towards me and now I can start stepping over my partner's legs like we did before similarly. Or the easiest one is just to take our elbow and fight it inside our partner's elbow like so. And now from here I take my head down to my partner's hip. Once my head is down to my partner's hip I block my partner's hips and I just walk to north south and solidify top pin with a north south pin. It's very important that from here I first fight my elbow to the inside position. Remember we talked about that battle for inside position. If I just try to walk to north south and my partner's elbow is inside, she just brings left knee and elbow together and now I come onto that frame and the second knee comes in and now you don't have any of the inside position. So I make sure I take the time to first fight to the inside. Now as I'm going to drop down I have to make sure that my head comes down to my partner's hip. If my head doesn't come down to my partner's hip and I don't go ear to hip, my partner will always bring that left knee inside and now again I'll come onto that frame which will make space for the elbow to come inside and now from here I come onto the frames. So I beat her at the inside position and I make sure I'm disciplined with this, getting into the inside position first before I make the transition to a top pin. So I have this scoop grip, I'm past my partner's legs but I'm not past her guard yet. So from here I take the inside position, I take the inside position with my shoulder line relative to her knee here. Now when she goes to recover, she doesn't have any of the inside real estate and I can make a transition to a top pin nice and easy. So from here we sit to this reverse underhook. From this position we feel like it's hard now for us to start moving around because our partner is either pushing us down the body or trying to bridge us around, moving us around. Whenever I see this we just come in and we scoop our partner's leg like so. Now off this scoop grip we come in and we just slide our shin right across our partner's hips. Now when she has to move me around now, it's not an easy thing to move me around. And now we just come in and we back step our leg right out. Now we have a variety of different ways we can go. We can pull our partner's leg down, we can go in, start going into our partner's leg, we can start stepping over into mount like so. We can start moving into north south. From here we can go in, take our head down like so, feel the inside position and walk, walk, walk. We can move into a situation where if we can reach back and cross face our partner like so we can come out, we can start passing right into side control, taking the inside position using that inside bicep tie to come forward, punch our underhooks in and pass the top pins. There's a variety of different ways we can do from here. It all starts by going from the scoop grip, back stepping past, then solidifying the pin we need to either mount, side control, or north south. The easiest and most reliable way to stay away from your partner's legs is getting to the inside position and walking to north south because of the fact that you don't need a cranial shift to actually pass your partner's guard. Going to north south is the one exception where you don't have to control your partner's head and shoulders to actually pass their guard. So it's always easier to pass north south from here. So now we're going to look at using the scoop grip to go into this reverse underhook and spinning our partner's leg and we can look at ways to enter through our partner's legs or pass in there. We're going to look at passing from there a little bit later. This comes up again off of our partner's attacking series. This time we go in, we switch to the scoop grip, it gives us more control over our partner's leg. Now as we come to the scoop grip, we move our shin across and now from this position we're going to start spinning our partner's leg where our goal now is to connect our left knee and our right heel. So I just post my hand on the floor. From here I take my right foot across to my partner's far side butt cheek. So my right heel is connected to her left butt cheek now. And now from here I just take my left knee and I slide it to my right heel. Now when I go to sit, this is important for safety, when I go to sit, if you're young and flexible, you can sit like this and get away with it. But the main issue here is if your partner tries to sit up towards you and pushes weight onto your foot and you go to sit back, you can hurt your knee from here. So I make sure that as I go to sit back, my shin is flush with my partner's body. And now when I go to sit, not only is it a lot more safe, you're not going to injure yourself, but it's just a lot more fluid going through the motion. When I sit back from here, I gather my partner's secondary leg, now we can figure four our legs and go into attacks and do cross-ashi grami if we should so choose. So we go in, we use this scoop grip to go through, we sit into this position, and now we'll start spinning. As I look to spin, I make sure that I take my foot across first. What I don't want is to take my knee through and now she just scoots out and my back's exposed or she can at least recover. So I make sure, first thing I do is I want to create a closed wedge around my partner's leg. I want to connect my knee and my heel. So the first thing I do is I take my heel across to the far buttocks. Now as she goes to scoot, it's a difficult thing from here. There's a closed wedge now surrounding my partner's leg. This makes it an easy thing for me to go through and either one, control my partner's just primary leg if I can't get to the secondary leg or even better, I go in and get to that secondary leg and I pull her through and figure four my legs and I'm ready to go into attacking positions. Conversely, I spin around my partner's leg from this position and now instead of creating an extra angle and turning and falling down to attack my partner's legs, I just take my right knee to the floor, I figure four my legs and now you have the threat of not only falling back into your partner's legs or rolling forward into your partner's legs, but you also have the threat of a guard pass, which is what we're going to look at later when we start back stepping to counter our partner coming up from half guard where I can punch an underhook and I can go into passes from there. But right now we're just going to look at the back step or the spin to this position where I can get to this tapo shiro position and start going into attacks on either my partner's legs if I want to or from a situation where I can start punching underhooks or other various submissions to go into attacks. All right, so now another great option is just using your inside elbow very quickly to just slide across the three-quarter mount. The scoop grip, understand that this is more of a tactical decision on your part, the scoop grip will give you more degree of control through the entire pass, but it takes longer. Okay, so let's say you have 30 seconds to pass, if you take a scoop grip, maybe you're going to spend 20 seconds trying to get to a pass and the guy turtles and you don't end up scoring. So understand that you have more control because you're controlling both of your partner's legs, but it usually takes a little bit longer to pass. Whereas if you use an inside elbow to just slide the three-quarter mount right away, it gets the knee free a lot sooner and gives you less control all the way through, but you can usually pass or make an attempted pass faster than using a scoop grip. So when I shoot to this reverse underhook, and I sit into this position, if I want to go to a scoop grip, I got to take a scoop grip, I got to slide my knee up and across. Now I have to try to backstep, my partner's usually holding on for dear life, and it takes me a little while to start backstepping, and I can eventually do it, but it usually takes me a little bit of time to pass from here. So another great alternative, if I want to just quickly free my knee, is the second I move to this position, just like we did before from the reverse overback or from the overback grip, I just take an elbow inside, and right from here, when she goes to start keeping my knee trapped, I just walk and push my partner's knees away from me, and I push the knee down, one, two, three, and my knee comes free, and we just slide the knee through and immediately start passing from three-quarter mount. And now from here, the knee's free, nice and soon, and from here we're going to start going in, moving to a crossface and an underhook, and start going in and passing in various ways from here. As we looked at before, she usually has hands in tight, like so, so I usually go to the crossface first, but if I can, if she sits up, I go to that near side underhook, or I can even body lock my partner from here. If at any point the elbow drifts too far behind the ribcage, I can even punch in a forcep underhook from here, and now we can go in and get a top-headed arm and start passing with a top-headed arm. So depending on what your partner's doing, there's a variety of different passing options from here. And now once we have some kind of upper body control, we come forward, we start using that butterfly hook to insert, and now from here, flip the soccer palm on the ground into various top pins for the win from here. Okay, so we use a quick inside elbow to slide the three-quarter mount and start passing from there. The inside elbow comes in from this position, we just slide across, we got a three-quarter mount, and now from here, there's a variety of things we can do. We can go, if there's time or space, we go near side underhook. If not, we go crossface, we start flattening our partner out. If we go crossface, we try to go crossface, she blocks it, I steal the inside knee position. And now from here, we fight back to the crossface. If we can get a far side underhook, we go underhook, and crossface, we go to top-headed arm. We can even take an underhook like so, and now we can pass the head across. We can take our knee up, and we can start knee slotting to this side. Or now, once you get to keep my leg trapped, we shear that leg free, and now we can pass to this side. We can go in, punch her, crossface in, and start passing with a good top pin, start attacking right from here. So a variety of different ways to pass from three-quarter mounts, and we'll experiment a little bit more. I'll go into more depth and more leg riding. From there, I just want to show you in little increments as we go along, passing from three-quarter mounts. But just a tactical decision, both are very good. The scoop grip gives you control of your partner's entire hip line and both of your partner's legs, but usually takes a little bit more time to pass. Whereas if you want to just slide right to three-quarter mounts, free the knee immediately, and then look to extract the leg, it offers a little bit less control, but it's usually a much faster way to free the knee. And if you need to score points quickly or you want to pass your partner's guard right away, it's usually a good option. Okay, so we started in just with the knee shield, and then we looked at getting to an overback grip. I wanted to give you guys some passes right off the bat. So if you get to an overback grip, you're actually confident that you can flatten the guy out or go into passes right from there or submissions right from there. So now you should have the confidence thus far. If you get to that overback grip, you can do some damage. You can put real passing pressure on your partner. So now we're going to go into ways of getting to that overback grip or getting chest-to-chest. My partner uses more advanced upper body frames, and they actually make a grip on your upper body, this time with double shoulder posts, and then we'll go into cross shoulder posts. So now once we actually do get to the overback grip, understand that all the passes are going to be the same from here. So you got the base, the meat and potatoes of the passing once you get to the overback grip. Now it's just, okay, how can we get to this overback grip when my partner uses more sophisticated upper body grips and frames from this high knee shield? And then we'll go into low knee shield and obviously butterfly guard with different upper body grips and then start passing from there. All right, so let's look at clearing these double shoulder posts. This is pretty common. It's not really what you should be doing, but it's a pretty common thing, so we should go over it. Let's look at how we can fight our hands to the inside position, get past that top knee and pass those double shoulder posts. The issue you're facing here is that now you're not just dealing with stuffing the leg. You can't just push the leg out or pull the leg through and come forward because when you beat the knee, you run into the hands and then you can't get to the shoulders. And conversely, if you beat the hands, then you run into the knee. So you have to deal with both the lower body and the upper body now, so it gets a little bit more complicated. So let's start pushing into our partner. She has double shoulder posts and she's playing a game where there's extension here. There's always going to be a game where I'm pushing into my partner and she's pushing back into me and I'm going to use that to my advantage. It's hard for me to clear hands if there's tension and she has a good grip on my shoulders. It's not going to be impossible, but it's going to be hard. If I use her push back reaction, where as she goes to push, now I can come inside and I can easily clear hands. There's some kind of separation between my shoulders and her hands. So I play a game where I start pushing in towards my partner, she goes to start pushing back into me, and now I can't just clear the hands and come forward. I have to play a game where I'm playing with the leg first and I look to move the leg out of the way. And once I clear the leg, in a split second, that's when I go to the hands. So I play a game where she's pushing into me, I'm playing a game, I'm trying to get to the head, I can't get to the head, it's a hard thing, she's clearing, she's posting, and now from here I go and I start moving the leg down. She goes to open up the leg, I pull the leg by, and now once I have the leg beat, I clear and I quickly take my hands to the inside position. Once my hands come to the inside position, I just come forward, I get to a collar tie, like so, and I just open up my elbow and that clears her post off. She goes to keep a strong post, it's a pretty easy thing to clear that collar tie, and I just blade my body so that from here, her arm comes off, and now I just go and I crash the bar shoulder. She goes to post to my shoulder, from here I just go and I take the inside bicep tie, I open my elbow, and that clears the second hand. And now this collar tie, as she goes to start moving away and pushing on me, I pull myself in and I move and I crash that bar shoulder, and from here we come through, we're ready to start going in and pinning our partner. So I deal with the leg first, the grips are easy to clear. The problem is if I clear the grips, I run to the knee. If I clear the knee, and I would take time, then I run to the grips and the knee comes back inside. So I go knee first, hand second. So we're playing in here, if I just go in and I just clear, I try to come forward, the knee stops me. So I play a game where I'm fighting at the knee and I'm pushing into my partner. She's pushing away, we're playing here, I play at the knee. Once I clear the knee, I have to go. I can't wait for the knee to come back inside because then I just run back into the frames. So I play at the knee first, I'm moving around, and we go through, and now we beat our partner's hands. We can also play a game, we don't have to use two inside bicep ties, we can come through, we can pull the knee through. Anything that clears my partner's hands off my shoulders is going to be a winning move to get us chest to chest. So I go in, I start going towards my partner, she goes to push, I clear the leg, I'm playing around with the leg, I clear the leg, we take an inside tie, and now from here we can either go double inside or we can just come across and push our partner's arm back. In general, if I'm using a cross post, I go here and here, I'll generally go in to an open back grip, which we'll look at in a second. In general, if I use two straight posts where I just take my hand straight in, my right to her left and my left to her right, then I'll generally come forward and crash the far shoulder here. These are general options. But anything that looks, we used stuffing methods in the previous section, anything that gets the leg out of the way first, and then I come through and I beat the hands. I come through and I beat the hands. I come through and I take hands inside. Let her hands slip off my shoulders. This is what I'm looking to do from here. I come forward, she's pushing into me, and now from here we come through, we get to the upper body position or chest to chest. We beat the leg first, then we beat the hands second. Looking to go in, beating the leg first, beating the hands second. Everyone tries to clear the hands off and push into the knee. You can't push into the knee. Beat the leg first, and as soon as you beat the leg, that's when you go in, you can easily slip the hands off. Never go hands first, legs second. Go leg first. Once you clear the leg, you're playing around, you're twitching, you're fainting with the leg. You can push that leg and bump the leg free, then you come forward, crash the far shoulder, get the hands to the inside, and get your upper body chest to chest position. Now let's look at rising methods where you quickly pop up and look to clear that double shoulder post. From here, for whatever reason, I feel like I'm having a hard time clearing the post, we just go in, we look to start coming up, we set the leg up, or we put a knee in like so. As we look to come up from here, we look to start taking that elbow to the inside position, and we get the elbow inside if we can. If we can get the elbow inside, it's a pretty easy thing from here to take a hand inside like so, come forward to my partner's head. But you guys should keep that shoulder post, it's a pretty easy thing. Just come forward, get to the head, and now from here, as I go to come in, I take my knee, as always, I cover my partner's knee, and now simultaneously, as my left knee connects to her right hip, my right knee connects to her left hip, and from here, my hand comes to the inside of the bicep. If I pull myself in, I fall to this position. Now when she goes to move away from me, not an easy thing. We go in, we lock our hands, and we start the same series we looked at before. So from here, we quickly rise up, I can't get past my partner's shoulder post or whatever the case is, I just want to go into a standing pass instead. We just go in, we pin that bottom leg, look to start stepping up from here. If we get the elbow inside, it's a pretty easy thing from here, to come inside, and now I just go in, we sit down to our knees, from here she goes to shrimp away, it's difficult. She goes to insert a butterfly hook, it's not easy. She goes to start taking that shoulder off the floor, she can't do it. And now we can go in and insert our hands inside. Now assuming we can't get that elbow inside, we come in, we feel like from here, it's going to be a difficult thing. Whenever I see this, if I feel like my partner is doing a good job of keeping that knee closed, I feel like I can't get the elbow inside, that's fine. From this position, I just take my knee and I bring it to my partner's center line, like so. So now from here, even if I can't get my elbow inside, it's okay. We take our left hand to the inside position, we grab a collar top. From here, we take our right hand to the inside, like so, and now from here, my partner goes to stop me with the knee, I just take my knee through, my left knee in, and now I open up my partner's hip by just running across to the side like so. And she goes to bring everything back inside now, I just use that collar tie to pull myself in, we go through, and we lock up. So whenever I see my partner's doing a good job of posting on the shoulder, I can't get my elbow to the inside. Maybe she has that strong knee to elbow connection, I can't get my knee inside, no problem. I take my knee from my partner's hip to my partner's center line. Now from here, if I still can't get my elbow inside, we just take a collar tie like so. We take our hand to the inside, and now all in one motion, she goes to keep that knee inside, I just walk. You see I'm opening up my partner's hip here with my knee position. Now as I walk, she goes to keep everything in tight, we just fall across. Now my knee is on my partner's far hip, my shin is parallel to my partner's hip line, like so. And now from here, we can pull ourselves in, we can make that upper body chest to chest connection and go to work. So what it'll look like, I go into a rising method, I'm attempting to get my elbow inside, and everyone knows if the elbow comes inside, it's going to be a problem from here. I'm playing a game, I'm pushing into my partner, we go in and we take a collar tie. She goes to move me around, and from here, we're ready to go. If you feel like your partner is doing an exceptional job of keeping that knee very, very tight, close to you like so, from here, whenever I see this, I come in, I give a quick hip switch, like so. If she's doing an okay job, I just drive my knee to the floor. If she's doing a great job, I hip switch. If I try to hip switch with my right knee on my partner's hip, this will happen. If I make sure I take my knee to center line first. It's only a few inches, but it makes a big difference. And now from here, she goes to post, now we're ready to go in. We have that chest to chest position that we love so much, and we can start going to work from here. So rising up quickly from half guard to a split squat, and returning back to half guard to find ourselves chest to chest and go to work. Now let's look at hip switching to this over back grip. Just another option that we have from this position where a partner has double shoulder posts on us with a high knee shield. Where from here, we can go in, we can start playing a game where we stuff the leg on by, and now we can go in and take either double inside ties, and we can shoot across this over back grip like so. Or we can go in, we can clear one tie, and then from here we can just quickly bat the other one out of the way, and we can use that same hand to just travel across and go to an over back grip, or of course, to that reverse under hook on this side like so, where we can go in and start attacking with passing. So we can use this over back grip, we can hip switch pass as well. Assuming that we can't get chest to chest, maybe from here we come in and we beat the leg, we go to start coming through, we get in, but our partner starts immediately pummeling a hand back inside, and now she goes to start shrimping out and away. As she goes to shrimp away, I can't get her flat, I can't crash her far shoulder, but as she goes to shrimp away, I sit to this over back grip, where now I can start going in and making my adjustments to get in chest to chest. And we can use all these in combination with one another. We can go in, we can threaten crashing the far shoulder, and we can switch to an over back grip. Many times, we go in to crash the far shoulder, the second I get here my partner posts the outside leg on the floor, starts shrimping away, and she's going to crash the far shoulder, it's just not there, I can't put the shoulder back. So from here, we go to crash the far shoulder, then we switch to an over back grip. Many times we go to switch to an over back grip, our partner leaves the hand behind, and now we have that inside bicep tie, so we initially went to go switch to the over back, and then we end up with chest to chest with crashing the far shoulder. Okay, so we can use these in combination. We can also use things like rising up, but from here I come in, I'm playing a game, I like to start going in, I like to start passing, and then from here I can switch, and as I beat my partner's knee, I switch, and I get to that over back grip, and I start working from the over back, okay? So we can use these all in combination now, where I use hip switching methods to get to over back grips in combination with crashing the far shoulder and using inside bicep ties to clear. We can use all these rising methods, we can use the linear methods towards the far shoulder, and we can use the hip switching methods for the over back grip in combination to overwhelm your partner's double shoulder post, and then eventually either get chest to chest or pass to the over back grip. All right, so now let's talk about a high knee shield and a cross shoulder post. This is what your partner should be doing, okay? If they're good, this is what the grip that they're going to have. So we're going to spend a lot of time on getting past this annoying cross shoulder post. Why is a cross shoulder post so effective? Number one, it allows your partner to form a strong knee and elbow connection on this side like so. So now, when I try to actually get past that top leg, it's hard for me to disconnect the knee and the elbow, and if at any point I do create a disconnection in the knee and the elbow and I actually get past the leg, it's hard for me to come forward into my partner because one, inside bicep ties aren't going to work now. I can't open up the arm against this cross shoulder post. Two, cross faces and collar ties aren't going to work because my partner has one hand dominating my shoulder line. In the previous section, she had two of her hands dominating my shoulder line, which meant that if I came inside the one hand, her hands have to stay in my shoulders, otherwise I'm going to come forward towards her. So I can take the one hand in and get a collar tie and pull myself in. Whereas now, she has one hand dominating my shoulder line and one hand to stop me from cross facing her. So I can't take inside bicep ties effectively, and I can't get to the head, I can't come inside and it's hard for me to get chest to chest from here. So this one hand, this one forearm across my shoulder line will completely negate me from coming forward and getting chest to chest. So even if I do beat my partner's knee, and I stuff the knee down, I go to come forward, and now there's enough time allotted for her knee to come back in and for her to recover. If I beat the arm, then I run into the knee. Okay? So we have to look at ways to get to a chest to chest position, whether it be crashing the far shoulder, hip switching, whatever it may be, against the cross shoulder post, and it's going to be much more difficult than the previous sections. I can't just stuff the leg down, it's not going to work for me. I can't just come in and expect to just move my partner's leg out of the way and think I'm going to come forward and get to a chest to chest position. She just uses that cross shoulder post to bring the knee back inside. The problem is whenever I do beat the knee, if I do stuff the knee out of the way, she has more than enough time with that cross shoulder post to reinsert the knee. Whereas before, and she has a double shoulder post or no grips at all, she has a double shoulder post. From here, I beat the knee, and now as she goes to bring it back in, there's not enough time for her to do so as I go to get chest to chest and crash the far shoulder. So it's very, very complicated, and I'm sure many of you spent hours and hours and hours here over the course of your training trying to get past that damn knee shield and that cross shoulder post. So we're going to look at ways to actually get in chest to chest and deal with that annoying cross shoulder post with a high knee shield from here. All right, so now when we're looking to go into this passing off this cross shoulder post, you have to understand that what most people try to do is they try to shove the leg by, stuff the leg through, and they try to just come forward, and in just one motion they try to jump from passing the leg to getting chest to chest. This is never going to work. All right, so you'll see like a big explosive movement where they move the leg by, however they're going to do it, and they just come forward and they try to lock their hands like this and pull the guy in. If you're 14 times as strong as the guy, then sure, it might work. If she has a cross shoulder post in place and I lock my hands like this and she tries to stop me, I can just pull myself in because I'm way stronger, but it's never going to work on anybody your own size or who can pummel in a sophisticated way. So the correct way to do this is to beat the leg and then look to climb up towards your partner's body through various hand fighting sequences. So I'll beat my partner's leg, for example, and we're going to look at hand fight sequences, but I have to find ways to look to start to pull my partner's arm by and then chop an arm down and then move to my partner's shoulder and then move to my partner's shoulder and then move to an over back grip. So I climb my way up my partner's body and I don't just stuff the leg by and then come forward and expect to get upper body inside position or get to an over back grip. So I play a game where I'm here, my partner's pulling, I'm playing a pull push game, and from here I come through, I pull the arm by, stuff the arm, I get to the shoulder, she goes to move away from me, I climb up my partner's body and I get to my preferred gripping sequences with over backs or with chest to chest position. So I'm climbing my way up my partner's body. There's going to be hand fighting sequences, not just one sequence where I stuff a leg by and I come forward like the other ones where I just stuff a leg and I go inside, bicep tie and I crash the far shoulder. It's going to be a fight to get to an over back grip or chest to chest position where I'm stuffing the leg by, I'm hip switching, I'm climbing up my partner's body and eventually I get control of my partner's head and shoulders. It's not going to be just one, I clear the leg and move into position. So keep this in mind as we're going through this and understand it's going to be much harder, it's going to be much more of a battle to get to that over back grip or chest to chest. All right, so now let's look at some grip fighting sequences to get to an over back grip or chest to chest. Most of the time what you're going to find is you're going to get to over back grips when your partner has a cross shoulder post. So you're going to have to go to an over back grip first and then either go to an ankle scoop series or flatten your partner out and get chest to chest or move from that over back, initial over back grip. So let's take a look at this. So my partner first is down on her knees, she has a cross shoulder post in place and I always play a game, this pull push dynamic here where I got to push into her, she has to push back into me and then I pull back and away and create some separation between her cross shoulder post and my collar bones, my shoulder line. If I try to move my partner's arm from this position it's going to be difficult. So I want to create just enough separation where I can still make grips but move the arm freely. What we're going to look to do from here, because we can't stuff the leg, because stuffing methods won't work from here, we're going to have to rely on mostly hip switching methods to at least get close to my partner and make an over back or get chest to chest. The problem is when I come forwards like so, if I'm trying to beat my partner's arm it's hard for me to just come linear and crash the far shoulder because of the cross shoulder post. So I play a game where I'm pushing into my partner, she goes to push back into me and then from here I can take a chopping, I can use a chopping method on my partner's tricep where I chop my partner's cross shoulder post down. So I push into my partner, she goes to push back, I pull away, I chop the arm down and now from here I either one, if she's close to me I shoot right to an over back grip and I control the crown of my partner's head and I switch my hips past the knee shield. If I come forwards, the knee shield pushes me away, she puts the cross shoulder post back in place and then I'm a beat from here. So I chop my partner's arm down, I hip switch past the knee shield, when she gets to push me with the knee shield, she can no longer do so and now from here I get to this over back grip. Depending on how hard your partner pulls away from you, sometimes as I get to push towards my partner she goes to push back, from here I go to bring the arm down, I can't go right to the over back grip, it's too far away. So from here many times, come closer, from here many times I go to the shoulder first, she goes to pull away, I pull myself in, one, two, so I get to the shoulder first, she goes in, she goes to push, I pull, one, two, she goes to pull away, three, four. It doesn't always look pretty, I'm kind of clawing at your partner's shoulder, but it gives you that little extra wedging that you need to get to your partner's head and shoulders. So if I feel like I go in and she's close to me, she's here, I'm pulling, she goes to push, I go right to the over back grip. Many times she's far enough away where I can't do that. I have to go in, she pushes away, I pull, and then from here I go in one. Sometimes I pull myself right in and I go to an over back grip. Sometimes she's trying to really pull herself away, she doesn't want me to control her head and shoulders. So I go in, I go to hit that initial chopping method, she goes to start pulling away, go in, and we pull ourselves in, one, two, three, four, we set that over back grip and we're ready to start going in to attack some of our partner. That's the first one, when we come in, she's going to start pushing away, I'm pulling, I'm pushing, I'm playing this game here. We get to that over back grip and we're ready to work. Many times what will happen is right off this attempted over back, from here I go to chop my partner's arm down, I go to her, sit to the over back, she's trying to pull the head away so aggressively that her elbow slips behind her rib cage like so, and now from here we can put an elbow in place. From this position, if I can get an elbow in place, now from here, it depends on where she goes. If she most of the time, as she goes to pull herself away from me, her elbow and her entire body, most of the time her knees will also point in this direction. So if she goes to pull herself away, many times we can end up in a situation where we land chest to chest and we can transition to a cross face, use that inside bicep tie and block the far shoulder like so. So a lot of times your partner will be caught in the transition trying to deny you control of the head and shoulders through the over back grip and they make a mistake, the elbow drifts too far behind them, you have an over back grip and you use an inside elbow to flatten your partner out. So a lot of times what will happen is we go in, she has this cross shoulder post, she goes to push, from here I go to the over back grip, she goes to pull away, and now from here we go in and we flatten our partner out. Whether we take an inside elbow like so or whether we go to an inside bicep tie, both are good. And now when she goes to bring the shoulder off the floor again, she can't do so and I can make a transition to a cross face and go to work. So provided we go into this attempted over back, she pulls away and by flattening yourself out you just flatten her out and go right into your attacks. So we go in, we're playing this pull push game, I'm trying to get to a collar tie, trying to get the upper body inside position, I can't do it, I switch, I go to the over back, she goes to pull away, I either punch and under hook like so, I put an inside elbow like so or I swim to an inside bicep tie. And as she goes to pull away, she flattens herself out, I go with her, and as she goes to pull away, instead of trying to pull her into me and keep her in this over back position, she goes to extend away and I don't have the crown of the head, she can actually pull herself away from me from here. So I let her go and as she goes, we just follow and then from here we're ready to come inside and start our passing game, chest to chest. So we attempt to get into an over back, if she denies me the over back and pulls away, we just follow her and flatten her out from here. Another great method from here is we can use this far arm or this outside arm to start pulling my partner's arm down. We can also do things where we post on our partner's tricep, so instead of using a chopping method, we can post the tricep from here, then we can pull the arm on by. We can go in, we can grab the wrist, we can pull the wrist down and then go into a chopping method. Anything that gets this form off my shoulder line is what I'm looking to do. So we can play a game where we pull push, we got to push this through and we reach through and we pull this arm down and now from here we control the shoulder. When she has to pull away and goes to put the shoulder post back in place, I go in and I sit through. We come in, we feel like it's hard to push this arm down. From here whenever I go to pull away from her, I got to push the arm down, she pulls the arm back towards her maybe. And now from here I can't chop the arm down. So now when I go to come forward, she replaces the shoulder post in place and I feel like the chopping method is not working. Whenever I see this, as she goes to push into me, I pull the arm physically towards me. So now when she has to pull it back, it's not as easy. This gives me an extra half a second now to chop the arm down and hip switch and get to that over back grip. So there's many different combinations we can use from this cross shoulder post. The goal is to clear the cross shoulder post for just a long enough amount of time to be able to hip switch past your partner's top knee and thread an over back grip or get chest to chest with your partner. So in general, I like to play a game where I'm coming forward, playing this pull push game and as she has to push back into me, I push away. I use it initially, I always try first with chopping methods where I chop the arm down and then I climb up my partner's body and get to that over back grip. If I feel that my partner is doing a good job of stopping me from chopping the arm down, where every time I go to chop the arm down, she pulls the arm back and I can't do it. And from here, and then I come back, she replaces the shoulder post in place and I feel like I just can't get the arm controlled in the way that I want to. I come in here and I physically grab the arm in a more meaningful way, whether it's posting on the tricep. So now when she goes to pull it back, it's hard because I physically have a post in my back of my partner's arm, I'm wedging it in place or you threw a pulling grip at the outside hand like so. Now when she has to pull it back, it gives me time to start sitting through and clearing that knee shield. Okay. So I generally use a combination of chopping the arm down and either pushing the arm by wedging it in place or pulling the arm towards me that she can't pull the arm back and that forces her to keep the cross shoulder post long enough to get extension to start chopping it down and climb my way up. And in addition, you can use rising methods to give you more of a pull push dynamic where I come in here and I play in this position. I start pushing. Now I have to drive off my feet. I can put weight onto my partner. I can crash the far shoulder from this position, but now she has to give her a real strong pushback reaction. And now from here we can go in and start pulling our partner's arm into a situation where I can switch right from a split squat into this over back grip. So we play here, we pop up, we use this rising method, and now from here we can pull the arm through. We can post on the tricep. And now once you guys use that cross shoulder post effectively, we just hip switch right from here. So this will look like, as I'm playing a game, I'm pulling, I'm pulling, I'm pushing, pushing, she's pushing me, and then here I pull through and I sit that over back grip. And now once I have the over back grip, we know where to go from there. Okay. So these are some great combinations of using, we can't just stop the leg because the cross shoulder post stops that, but we can use hip switching methods where we chop the arm down, we pull the arm toward us, and we wedge the back of the tricep. And then we can climb up our partner's body, starting at the shoulder, getting to the head, and then potentially flattening our partner out or working from the over back. And we can use a combination of those with rising methods where I pop up and we really put pressure into our partner's far shoulder, that will always elicit a strong pushback reaction. And a lot of times the rising method and the hip switching method in combination with the hand fighting will make it pretty easy to get past that annoying cross shoulder post and you can get to control of your partner's head and shoulders. All right. So now let's look at a situation where we just either want to go right into an attack or we can't get chest to chest, whatever the case is. And this can be technical or tactical, whether you're just not good enough to get chest to chest or whether maybe you're in a tournament where you need a submission quickly or guard passes really don't count for much and you just want to go for kimura. Whatever the case is, we have some great kimura entries we can hit from this cross shoulder post. So from here, my partner has a double shoulder post, it's a pretty easy thing to always be able to go in and get past that double shoulder post and get chest to chest. So if your partner is playing with anything besides a cross shoulder post, I generally recommend just going in and getting chest to chest and half guard because it's just a pretty easy option to get to. But when your partner's doing a good job of keeping a good cross shoulder post in place, then it gets a little tricky. If I can't get chest to chest, I can start going in and threatening kimuras from here. So one thing is when I go to switch, hip switch passes this frame and gets his upper back grip, if my partner goes to pull the elbow back and I don't want to punch an underhook in, I can always just sit to a situation where as she goes to punch the elbow back, I just shoot my hand in like so and now we just go in and lock kimura and we can flatten our partner out and go into that same kimura passing theory that we looked at before. So this is always an option. Instead of punching an underhook in, we can just place our hand in place where I go from the overback to the kimura and I just shove the wrist down and we lock up. We can also play a game where from here we go in, instead of pulling with my outside hand, pulling the hand towards us with the cross shoulder, we can go in and we can play a game where we just lace our partner's legs. Normally you see people weaving the leg and putting the hand on the floor here to stop your partner from inverting or whatever the case is and they kind of stall from here. I can use this same leg weave to come through and catch my partner's hand like so. I don't grab the wrist because my partner kind of knows it's coming. They pull the hand back a lot of times and they strip the grip. I normally just weave my leg in here. I'm playing a game where I'm trying to cross face and going in. I'm distracting her. She has an inside bicep tuck. I'm playing a game where I create diversions and then all in one motion I just come up and I reach to my partner's hand like so. Now I slide my knee in, I pull that hand down and I pull myself back. That was no cross shoulder post. In all one motion, the elbow is exposed. We just whip our body around the corner and sit right to a sit situation where we lock in and lock Kimura. This is also a good way to sit to an over back grip if you want to. You can sit to an over back grip if you want to just to pass with this grip or you can sit to a Kimura. I usually use it for a Kimura. So you play a game. We're trying to get past this annoying cross shoulder post. We feel like we can't do it. Whatever the case is, I'm pulling it through. It's not working. And from here we just come through, we're playing a game. We're trying to get to the head. She's clearing it. She's trying to scoop my leg. I'm stopping her. We play a game. We go in and we just catch. Now all in one motion, we pull the hand down and we clear the cross shoulder post. As we clear that hand down, we just take our knee and slide it in and we pull the hand and we just hip switch. Right to a situation now where we can go through. We unwrap our hand from our partner's leg and we just sit to a Kimura where now we can go in and go in the attack. So we're here. She has a cross shoulder post. We're trying to clear it. We're trying to post it. Whatever the case is, we can't do it. We come through all in one motion and we just catch our partner's wrist. We do this by dipping the shoulder. She goes to start pushing. We sit through and now we're ready to go into attacks with Kimura or we can always transition to an underhook, flatten our partner out and move back to our positional passing game from a chest to chest position. So locking Kimura off of this initial cross shoulder. We can also do this in situations where we pop up to a split squat briefly and my partner is pushing on me like so. I can come through, I can catch and now from here, right from this split squat, I pull everything down and I just jump across to this position. I don't want to land on her so I didn't lock Kimura. But if you're doing this live, you land in this position here where you land chest to chest on your partner with the Kimura locked and then you're ready to go. I can play between these methods here. I come forward, I come through, I like to hit it from here. I come up, I build a position like this, we come through, I use this grip, I pull the wrist down and now from here we just jump to a situation where we can go in, lock Kimura and go on the attack. So we can use it from the knees, we can use it from the feet. It's a very versatile grip which will lead you into either an overback grip, a chest to chest position or more than likely a Kimura you're going to be using this grip for. So now let's look at going into inverted kata kata meis, dar strangles off of this cross shoulder pose. When we fail to get to an overback or fail to get chest to chest or we just want to go for something different. Everything we've been doing has been built around moving the elbow out of the way to get across shoulder post. This is a perfect time for dar strangles. So whenever I see I can get my partner's hand by like so, we can go and we can get to this overback grip or we can pull a hand through and from here we can get to this overback grip. This is all we need. So what we're going to look for is to just initially lock our hands. If we can initially just lock our hands everything's going to be much easier. The problem is we feed our hand through and our partner starts to move away from us and extend the body and then the hands can't lock and then it makes everything more difficult. So the first goal is just to get our hands locked in a ten finger grip. If we can do that everything else is going to be a lot easier. So we come in, we're playing this game where now from here we either shoot a hand on by and from here we go to an overback grip. Now if I start going, actually we'll look at this in a second, I go to the overback grip and from here we just go in and we just lock our hands like so. With my top hand pointing away from me and my bottom hand locked in, ten finger like so. So now once you guys start moving around from here, extending away from me, it's difficult. We can go in, we can pull the arm by. So I can pull the arm by like so, from here we can shoot through, then we can lock. I can push the arm through like so, I can go over and then I can lock. I can club the arm by, I can go over and then I can lock. So anytime the elbow stays in position we can go through and we can lock up with darts. Now the main danger from here is my partner will start trying to pull her back to the floor and pull her elbow back across. So the second I get my hands locked, the first thing I do is I take my ear and I glue it by partner's scapula. So now when she gets to pull the elbow back and the shoulder to the floor, it's not going to happen. And this gives you time now to come through and to make a transition from ten finger to figure four. If I try to make this transition and you're just worried about finishing your partner and there's no wedge behind your partner's scapula, she will always pull the back to the floor. So I make sure I put a wedge behind my partner's scapula with my ear and looking towards my partner's head. Now when she has to pull the back down, this wedge makes it easy. Now I tighten everything up by taking my support arm, my right hand is a strangle arm, my left arm is a support arm. I take my support arm, the hand of my support arm as close as I can to my partner's head. This will immediately tighten the strangle. If my support arm runs down my partner's spine, it's not going to be a tight strangle. So I lean my head out and over my partner's head and this allows me to take my hand up nice and high towards my partner's head so that now my arm is more parallel to my partner's shoulder line than it is her spine. This will immediately tighten the strangle from here. And now there's a variety of different ways that we can go from here. If your partner stays with the half guard locked, you're going to finish them by pulling the right elbow up to the ceiling. Your partner has to do everything they can to disconnect their hips from yours. If she stays in a half guard, I just sit to a hip and I pull myself in and she's going to get finished. So she actually has to let the half guard go in order to not get finished. She has to disengage her legs from here. And now from here, we have a choice. I mean, obviously I can go into hours of teaching from darts from here, front head locks and stuff. But we have a choice of either going in, allowing her to pull the elbow to the floor, and then switching to a cross face and an inside bicep tie, like so. But now when she goes to recover from here, it's difficult. We can stay with the darts and we can step over into mount. We can step, we can go into neon belly. There's a variety of different things that we can do from here. She pulls the elbow back to the floor. We can take our ear to our partner's hip and we can walk to north south. There's a variety of different things we can do from there. That's more along the lines of going into attacking from strangles and darts and things like that. But just getting to the darts and using the threat of the darts to either finish or get past your partner's legs is what we're looking for. So we come in, we take that arm on by, and from here we come through. Maybe we can't get to an over back grip, but we come through and we lock our hands in a 10 finger grip like so. Maybe we were a little bit too far for the over back grip. Maybe we just wanted to go into a darts, whatever the case is. Now the big mistake everyone makes is they try to jump from a 10 finger grip to a darts. You'll lose your partner's shoulders and elbow every time. So I wedge the back in place here and she has to bring the back out now, the elbow free. She can't do it. Now I lock up nice and deep. Now I tighten the strangle by moving my support arm. Right now it's running along my partner's spine. I need it to run along my partner's shoulder line like so. If she stays here, now she'll get finished. So she has to disengage and as she gets disengaged, now I'm past my partner's legs, past her guard. I can step over into mount. I can move to north south. I can move to side control. There's a variety of different things that we can do and pass easily from there. So we use the threat of the darts to go in and pass our partner's guard or finish. And worst case scenario, the threat of the darts is a real threat. How many times in competition have you seen people escape when a guy has a fully locked darts, the figure four? Not many times, right? So the threat of a darts, provided it's locked, is a real, real threat. Whenever you go in and attempt to go in for a darts, your partner will instinctually pull away and try to elongate the body and put their back on the floor. Okay. That's a defense of the darts. That's exactly what we want. So we pull the arm by, however it may be. We shoot the hands through and we lock our hands. Now this time we go in, we start trying to, uh, to go forward and, uh, lock up the darts. We attempt to start dipping our shoulder down. We wedged it back in place. We're going to shoot our hand through, but you feel like the elbow is slipping and the shoulder is coming to the floor. Whenever I see this, my hand just comes around the corner and we transition to a cross face. She goes to aggressively pull everything away from me. We just moved to an inside bicep tie. We'd lock her hands in the far shoulder and we flatten our partner out and now we're ready to work chest to chest. So we use the threat of a darts to get chest to chest and start passing. So I come in here, I get my 10 finger grip. The second I feel her going to move out of the way, the head has to extend back in this direction. This will always expose her jaw to a tight cross face. Here it's hard to get a strong cross face, but it's easy to get a darts. So this is the dilemma. If she allows me to crunch her chin to her chest, the darts comes in easy. If she takes the chin away from the chest and starts extending away, makes the darts hard, but the cross face easy. And now because my hands are already inside, when she goes to pull the elbow free, I just transition across to the far shoulder. And now from here, we flatten our partner out and ready to go in and work from chest to chest half guard. So we use the threat of a darts to either of course finish the darts or lock the darts and pass, or we use a threat of a darts where as my partner goes to extend and bring the chin away from the chest, she exposes herself to a cross face, expose herself to an inside bicep tie, and because my hands are already inside, the second she goes to pull away, we're ready to go in and flatten our partner out and start working. Okay? So having these submissions is super, super important because the threat of submission will get you past your partner's guard many, many times. This is why the whole series is called attacking from guard and not passing guard, because you have to have attacks from top position. You can't just be trying to pass, pass, pass the whole time. You have to threaten your partner and the threat of submission will inevitably create avenues to pass your partner or get chest to chest and then work from there. All right, so now we're going to look at using the threat of the legs, of leg locks, to either of course go into leg locks or to pass your partner's guard. So whenever I feel I'm just dealing with an annoying cross shoulder post, I can't get Kimura's going, I can't get Darcy's going, my partner's upper body grip fighting and pommeling is just, they're just so good that the upper body is just not available. I can't get chest to chest, I can't pass this guy's guard, I can't flatten him out, I can't get to an overback grip, and I can't go into submissions in the upper body. What do I do now? Whenever I see this, just start using scoop grips to go into your partner's legs. Now understand a high knee shield is a very good and useful position, but it does leave your legs exposed because right now she has one leg inside and I have one leg inside. If she wants to hide her leg, she has to put a butterfly hook inside, where now she has her leg safe, but it's many times easier to get past the knee and there's other drawbacks and there's pros and cons to both. But when she has a leg outside, now I have an easily accessible scoop grip available to me. So there's a couple of ways that we can go about this. Number one, if she has a cross shoulder post in place, is I can just take my left leg up and just slide it right across my partner's hips like so. Now if you do this, it's very important that you make sure that you sit back towards your partner's near hip. If I lean too far forward, my partner can push me out in this direction, and now she can expose my leg and now you're going to get heeled up because your leg's on the outside. So whenever I do this, I make sure I sit back towards my partner's far hip, my partner's near hip like this. Now if she gets to expose my leg, she can't do it. And now we're in the same scoop gripping passing option that we had before, where now from here we can go in, we can back step, and we can start to go and do all of our passing right from here. We can go in, once we back step, we can move to this reverse under hook and now we can start to pass to north south or side control mount, whatever you want from here. So we use this scoop grip to start going in and passing our partner's guard when we feel like we can't get to the upper body grips. So we can start creating threat of the leg. Everyone knows now, especially 2022, when you scoop grip a leg, like they're worried about a leg block. Okay, that's just how Jiu-Jitsu's evolving now. If I scoop a leg and I start moving to this position, you know it's going to be an issue. If I scoop a leg, I can either post on the floor or even better if someone's sitting up towards me, I can post on the chest or I can post on the throat to keep them flat. And now from here I can go through and I can sit to this scoop grip position like so. If my foot's on the outside, I'm making sure I'm always leaning back towards my partner's near hips. When she goes to expose my leg, she can't do it. And now from here I play a game where I just go through and we back step out. Conversely, if you want to make sure that your leg stays safe the whole time, as we talked about, if she wants her leg to stay safe, she has to pommel it inside. So if I want my leg to be guaranteed to be safe, I have to pommel my leg in first. So I can go in and I can pommel in front of my hook in first. So now when I go to start moving to a scoop grip, I can post my partner's shoulder, the floor, whatever the case, and from here we slide across. And now we have a scoop grip, but now my partner goes to expose my leg, she pushes me in this direction, it just leads me into a spin. For now from here we can fall into our partner's legs or we can start passing from this tapo shiro position. So if you can pommel a butterfly hook in, that's great. The drawback to pommeling a butterfly hook in is your partner will start to get nervous and with a good guy, almost immediately clear this knee inside. So if I'm here and I have this scoop grip, then I'm not really too worried about it. I mean people can scoop the leg here, they can play around, and then I can go in and I can confidently get my shin across both at the time. But if I pommel my foot in, your partner knows something's going to happen. So most of the time when you see this, they'll immediately take an elbow inside your knee and try to free that bottom knee and push you back in some kind of open guard and free that bottom knee and now they're back in open guard. So just understand if you're going to pommel a butterfly hook in from here, it's best to do it if your left knee is connected to the hip. So now from here I just take my right knee off the floor and I pin my partner's leg. If I don't pin my partner's leg, she just points her knee towards the ceiling. I can't pommel my butterfly hook in. So from here I pin my partner's leg. When she goes to keep that knee up, I pommel my butterfly hook in. And because my knee is connected to my partner's hip, when she goes to knee elbow escape, she can't do it. These are the kinds of things that can happen when you match it. Most people try to pommel in a butterfly hook from here. The butterfly hook comes in pretty easy, but the knee elbow escape counteracts it and she's escaped. Or if you have good knee position from here, so I say okay now the guy can't knee elbow escape, so when I go to pommel a butterfly hook in, it's impossible. So I just take my right knee off the floor and I use it to pin my partner's leg here. When she goes to off balance me from here, it's not easy because I have a scoop grip. When she goes to knee elbow escape, she can't do it. When she goes to pommel that or bring that knee up high, I pommel my foot in. And now from here we go in and we're in and ready to go. Now we have the choice of either spinning the leg to go into attacks or passes, or we can back step right from here. Now we're ready to start applying from the same position we just did. So using a threat of a leg lock, or at least taking a scoop grip where you take a scoop grip, your partner's worried about the legs and they should be. You can go into leg locks from there. But you can go into a scoop grip and you can either take the shin across with the outside foot position where you have to be a little bit more cognizant of protecting your own foot and leaning back towards the near hip. Or you can pommel a butterfly hook in in a very specific way against a good player, having a good knee to hip contact so they can't knee elbow escape and wedging their knee against the floor so they can't point the knee towards the ceiling and stop the butterfly hook from coming in. And once you pommel that butterfly hook in, then you can use a scoop grip to start spinning the leg to a tabo shiro, making sure your leg is safe, and then you can go into various attacks and positional gains from there.
