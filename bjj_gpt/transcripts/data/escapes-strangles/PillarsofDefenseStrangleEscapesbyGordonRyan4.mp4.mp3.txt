 So, so arm and guillotine is the most robust as a controlling position because of the fact that you have the head and the arm controlled. So you have a lot more control over the upper body relative to the low elbow and the high elbow guillotine. That being said, because the arm is involved, you need to have better mechanics. Your mechanics have to be on point in order to actually get a strong strangling effect from this arm and guillotine. Now, if you have proper strangling mechanics and you have a head and arm guillotine in place, it is going to be incredibly hard for someone to escape because the mechanics are more than good enough to strangle and it is always a time based thing and it is a more controlling position. So this can be a real pain in the ass to escape when your head and arm is trapped, especially when your partner has closed guard and they have strong finishing mechanics. It can be a real issue. So let's take a look now at some escapes from here. A lot of them are very similar, but they have some key differences because your head and arm are trapped and we are going to run through what those differences are. Alright so now we are going to look at rolling through, a very conservative method with this arm and guillotine. Now this is actually a little bit different because the fact that your partner has control over the arm now and the head. So it makes it easier for them to follow you. So what will happen a lot of times is she will have an arm and guillotine, she will go to sit and from here I go to roll on through and she will use a combination of her knee and elbow connection on that far side and a pulling of her elbow back to her hip to use that to pull herself with me and pull herself up on top of me. And you will find yourself, oh man this is no good. So she can keep a much better connection to me because of the fact that the arm is trapped. So you have to be cognizant of this. The second I see that she goes in for this arm and guillotine, I take my arm and what I don't want is for my right elbow and arm to get caught between her knee and elbow connection on this side. This is a disaster. So the second I see that from here she locks head and arm guillotine and I go to roll, when she goes to step her leg up I never come forward towards the leg and try to go into a double leg. Unless I am trying to jump over into side control. Which we will look at in a second. But from here when she goes to roll me through I take my hand and I bring it through across my partner's hips. Never caught between the knee and elbow on this side. So I take it through the hips like so. So now when she goes to sit down I block the hips with the back of my hand like so. When she goes to start finishing me I just roll. And this roll now will take me through as we go to come up I re-center the head and I can go right into drag and I can go right into offense and we are out and away. So the key here, let me just switch sides for a second, is to never get my elbow and arm caught between this connection. This will allow her to follow me through a roll much easier. So I make sure and when she goes to lock up I go here. Now we go to roll and she goes to follow she has much less of a purchase because now my right arm is rather free. So when she goes to follow me through head comes out and I'm ready to go. We have to make sure my partner doesn't switch over into anacondas or dorsals from there. But because you're rolling through and you're looking to re-center the head it's a pretty easy thing to make an adjustment and take the head out. But the main thing, it's very similar, but if you get your elbow caught between her knee and elbow connection it's going to be much harder for you to roll, much easier for her to form a connection, slow your roll down and follow you into a top position and finish. Okay so just as before we can always run to side control but understand you're going to end up with the near side of underhook this time instead of a cross face because of the fact that your arm is trapped. So this time my partner locks in that arm and gi team. She goes to sit back and from here we only block our hip, we post on our partner's hip and we have the inside elbow position. Right from here it's going to be hard for me to post on my partner's knee because she's going to be pulling her elbow back to her hip presumably. So it'll be hard for me to post on my partner's knee. So instead I just take my bicep and I just wipe the knee on by. So when she goes to fall back and lock closed guard, just wipe the knee on by and now we can't reach over the head so we just cover the hips, we lift, we move to near side underhook. Now we have double underhooks from here. And now when she gets to finish the gi team, she has no mechanics because there's no hip tip connection, there's legs aren't involved and now from here we just grab the wrist and we just play a time sensitive game where we go through and now we separate our partner's grip. So a little bit different this time, instead of posting on our partner's knee we just use our bicep to wipe that leg on by. So when she goes to sit through we just block the hip, the second she goes to sit down I just scurry around my partner's legs. Now I cover the hip so she can't shrimp away, the main thing I don't want is her shrimping away and reinserting legs. The second I get here we cover the hip, she gets to move, we lift and we lock and now we're ready to go in and start playing our game from top pins from here. Just from the other side so you can see the mechanics a little bit with this hand better. She goes to start sitting and we just wipe. We cover, she goes to start shrinkling, I lift and I lock and now we're ready to start playing from topside control with double underhooks. Okay so now as we spoke about it's going to be harder from this position when my partner throws her shin across and she has the elbow trap now between her knee and elbow connection it's going to be harder to roll. It's not going to be impossible but it will be harder. So let's take a look at this. She takes her shin across, she fires her leg over and we're in this arm and knee team here. From here I'm not going to say it's impossible to roll but understand that if you do start rolling in this direction it's going to be hard to post on your partner's hip. Okay because she's going to be pulling an elbow back. So when I do go to roll the chances of her coming up on top and following me through pulling her elbow to her hip and using this arm of mine to slow my movement down you can't end up in a mountain geeky. So I'm not going to say it's wrong or impossible to roll you can do it. You can do it from here and as I go to roll it has to be quick and I have to whip my body underneath her. So when she goes to follow you can it is possible to do but the chances of you ending up mounted do do increase. So this is what I generally recommend and this is a sensitivity thing that you're going to have to play around with a few times and it's a timing and sensitivity thing I can't really teach it to you it's just you have to do it a few times and you'll understand when the right time is to roll through and the right time to hop across is right and this is just overall mat time that you have to get used to it the part of this is timing. This time I'm going to attempt to roll my partner tries to follow me I'm going to quickly hop back in the opposite direction and use that same motion that we use to wipe our partner's leg by and I'm going to misdirect going in one direction first and hopping across the side control on the opposite side. So from here I go in I start to move out in this direction she naturally wants to follow me so her leg this leg will be moving will be over my back and now we're trying to follow me and track me so I run in one direction right before I'm going to roll she goes to follow me we just hop across and now we lock up we're in side control on the opposite side and we misdirect we try to go for a roll through which you can do but can be risky so we go to roll and as we go to roll she goes to follow follow follow right into the last second where she's overextended and we just wipe everything on by misdirect to the other side and we get a nice clean pass into side control so she locks up I can't post in the hip from here I post on a knee instead I start running she goes to follow and now we lock everything up and we're past our partner's guard okay do it from this angle now we're in side control ready to pass with a nice misdirection training a roll dilemma and if your partner gets overextended trying to follow you with the legs just wipe the arm by whip your body across and just shuffle across into side control on the opposite side all right so this method the same methods we used before so I'm gonna say that you can go into a high tripod you can insert a butterfly hook and you can try to roll the problem with rolling out of these guillotines is always gonna be the fact that your partner can always connect their knee and elbow and they can make it labored for you to roll where you can't roll as quickly as you want and they can end up on top of you so you can do the same role we looked at before with the high tripod but the one that I prefer the most is using the wrist grab and the head wedging method okay where she goes to finish me from here and I'm not gonna spend too much time because we did this but she locks half guard with an arm and guillotine and then from here we just come forward and we play this game where right from here she locks into half guard we cover our partner's knee from here and now we're ready to go in and she when she goes to finish it's difficult for her to finish now we just play a waiting game until the hands come open then we take our head back to the outside okay so I'm not gonna say you can't go into a high tripod try to post in your partner's hips insert a butterfly hook free it and then roll but when she pulls her left knee to her left elbow that will pull her on top of me and sometimes end up with me in the mounted arm and guillotine and things can go south from there so generally my favorite thing to do is grab a wrist come forward and because you're not in full guard you can always get your head forward enough to not get strangled from that half guard position and then you just play a waiting game until you're out and about all right so now we're gonna move into close guard by the way I forgot to mention this but for the for the cross shin method just so you guys understand you can use the rolling and you use misdirection as well you can also use the wrist pull method from here where I can take my head forward and from here we can just play a waiting game until from here my partner separates the hands and I stuff and then we can start going into passing you can use that method as well you can also use the rolling method and the misdirectional method I just forgot to mention that because we've been doing it so much but you can use that and I'm not refilming that whole clip so I just wanted to throw that in there for you guys now for for close guard I'm not gonna go over this and do them individual clips because the escapes are all the same okay because you're not rolling from this position it's all it's all the same stuff I either use the wrist pull method to come forward and I stop you I back step and I play from there you can even the best you can you can try to post on your partner's hip with the low elbow when I get a back step low elbow when I get a back step I can post on my partner's hip and that makes it harder for her to move the hips around when she has the arm in giki it'll be harder to post on the hip but I can still use lock up I can still use that same back step method from here so when she now she goes to finish me it'll be hard and from here we can go in and post on my partner's hip if possible now from here if she locks up if I can't post on the hip and she's pulling that left elbow so well into into her into her chest and I go in here and I back step and now she unlocks her legs understand from here even if she unlocks her legs and she goes to palm a little butterfly hook in it's gonna be hard to post on your partner's knee because your arm is trapped okay so when I'm here on the arm in giki if there's no arm in and we posted on the knee here if the arm is in I won't be able to do this so when the arm is in I won't be able to stuff the knee and end up in half guard on this side it's unrealistic to think that so instead when she uses the butterfly hook and she unlocks her legs I don't want to entangle my legs I don't want to get her hips back to mine the first thing I do is I take my left heel and I tuck it in here if she can wrap my leg up and get some kind of control over my legs and she's strangling me doesn't look like much here but this extra second may cause you to tap so the second I back step and she goes to take her butterfly hook in I don't want this leg out here and I want my hips coming up square so I hide my left heel like so she puts butterfly hook in she can't trap me with the left leg now all she has is the right leg butterfly hook which can only push not pull and now from here I just hop far away like so so her legs are completely disentangled and now from here we can look to go into our rolling methods and take our head out of the way so almost the same here but a little bit different because you won't be able to post on your partner's knee when I do open our legs so the wrist pull method I'm here now from here she unlocks her legs she puts a butterfly hook in so I don't do is try to go towards the hip the knee and then get my second leg entangled and now I'm trying to move away and I can't do it so from here I back step she unlocks her legs I keep my hips turn and I hide my bottom leg I can't post on the knee now I can't step over into half guard so when she goes to use that butterfly hook to take me over we scoot far away and now we can go into our roll where we can recenter our head and we're out and rolling through into turtle position on the opposite side so the wrist you pull on the wrist is pretty similar but there are some key differences because your elbow is trapped between their knee and elbow connection and you have to be cognizant of this okay the four pointing method is going to be exactly the same except I'm not going to have the ability to move this hand above her head or four point where I wanted to it's pretty much it's got a post on the floor where it is and I come up into that four point usually because the head and the arm are trapped the guillotine isn't really mechanically as tight and a lot of times because there's more mass between your partner's arms the four point method is a little bit easier to hit if it's arm in okay in normal circumstances when I'm trying to roll through or I'm trying to pull my head of my arm out she has more control okay because you can form that knee elbow connection that'll help her when there's less there's more mass I'm trying to circle my head in usually it's a little bit easier to circle my head in because all the mass inside of my part is on inside my part is locked if she's a tight guillotine low elbow and she's locked up tight it's hard to circle my head out but if she's over the arm now the circle she makes with her hands is now much bigger because there's an extra arm in there now so when she has a low elbow guillotine the circle is much tighter when she's an arm in guillotine the circle is bigger so that a lot of times makes it easier to circle my head out so the four pointing method with an arm in guillotine usually works pretty well so she goes in she locks up when she even when she locks up tight it's a pretty easy thing to circle my head out if I can't I can thumb post my way out okay this is a good method when you're talking about especially arm in guillotines all right and then finally if I feel like the grabbing the wrist isn't working four pointing isn't working then of course as always we look to start leaning forward clear everything and now ready to go in and start bringing everything passing across moving side control going into our escapes we looked at before okay so a very similar I want to put all of its different moves because we've got over them already they're all almost exactly the same except for you have a little bit of difference with the when your opponent opponent opens the legs not being able to post on their knee and jump over into half guard and making sure your legs don't get reentangled all right but pretty similar all right so this is a hard of submission to escape okay because of the fact that because your arm is trapped and if your partner is doing everything right you're not gonna be able to get a hand posted on the hip which means you're only gonna have one hand to post on the hip and one frame this which isn't reinforced so if you have one hand in the hip you can lift one hip and bridge in one direction we have to be harder to off balance them to bridge in the opposite direction and if you have a cross hip post you can really push with one elbow in one direction that's gonna be hard to tricep post and extend your tricep to move them in the opposite direction you need one strong post if you have a cross frame and then one weak post which you don't really have the ability to move your partner's hip or you have a post with your the ball of your hand on your partner's hip and you have the ability to bridge on one side but not off balance and bridge them to the other side so this is a definite problem okay so my partner has me in arm and gi team you'll see what I'm talking about now when she has me in this gi team she has her left elbow coming back to her hip so now this arm is like just floating around in space here and I won't be able to get it to my partner's hip to post on it which means I can only post here like so or here like so and this gives me the ability to push strongly in this direction but not in this direction okay if I'm gonna take my hand to my partner's hip and we end up here because you're getting strangled so it is a time thing but understand you won't have any kind of strong enough nearly strong enough push to get an initial off balance if your elbows outside your partner's hip so I always take the time no I always take the time to bridge a few times and get my elbow inside my partner's hips and now I have a legitimate way to push on my partner okay if I'm here and I feel like my elbow is outside the hip and I want to post to the hand on the hip I always bridge bridge bridge and I get the elbow inside now if your partner's smart she'll take the hand that the that knee all the way up high so now you can't get the hand to the hip whenever I see this this is always a time to go cross post like so now from this position it's gonna be tough I have to start my escape is gonna be in this direction because I can't I can't create a bridge strong enough in this direction to actually start kipping I can't get my weight onto one of my partner's knees so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start with a kazoo she in this direction so I'm gonna bridge and my right hand is gonna shoot across the body just for a small off balance so I bridge one two and then from here I start kip kip kipping I can get my knees to the inside it isn't gonna be easy this is what's gonna look like I bridge one two and then I start kipping and I start my kip from there okay so we go in my partner has an arm in guillotine from here if my elbows inside the inside the knee I can post on the hip like so my elbows outside the knee I can go cross frame same goes for a low elbow guillotines she goes to a low elbow guillotine or a high elbow and I have to make a conversion to a low elbow if her knees are up this high posting on the hip won't suffice I take a cross frame here or a cross frame here okay so just understand the relationship between the framing and your partner's knee position you have inside elbow position you can post on the hip if your partner has inside knee position you post cross hip okay we talked about this a lot in the mountain structure okay now she goes arm in guillotine once again from here we go and we go cross frame I start with an initial kazoo she an off balance in the opposite direction I want to escape so I bridge one two and I start kipping kipping kipping and now from here we're out and we're ready to go this is easier said than done but this is your this is your path to escape so understand things are different now and because your partner has the arm trapped that takes away a hip post and it only gives you the ability to bridge strongly to one side so you start with a small bridge in a kazoo she to one side and then you follow it up as your partner goes to re-center and adjust to that with a strong bridge to the opposite side where you start kipping kipping kipping and then bring knees and head back into a good defensive stance and you're ready to go into counterattacks all right so just going to run through this real quick just like before the end game is always time sensitive can you pull the wrist down get your head into proper position proper position not get strangled and extract your head before your partner gets the right mechanics and strangles you can you four point out and circle the head in before you get strangled and if you can't four point out and you can't grab the wrist and get your head in proper position can you push your partner's knee line below your hip line before you get strangled if the answer is yes if you can do one of those three things you're out if you can't then you get strangled and this is kind of the end game because you only have so much time to hit one of these escapes and if you run out of time you're going to get finished okay so now there's a lot of debate on this people call it an arm and guillotine it's not an arm and guillotine okay when you talk about karagatame karagatame is specified where the shoulder is part of the strangle when i go into a seated karagatame it looks like a guillotine but the shoulder is part of the strangle the shoulder is strangling her on one side that's why this isn't an arm and guillotine it's a seated karagatame and now from here when i unlock my legs and close guard whatever the case is i finish what looks like a guillotine but it's not an arm and guillotine it's a seated karagatame and that is what gives you strong finishes from here okay the with the arm and guillotine or any other guillotine the shoulder may be trapped you may be controlling the arm but there's no connection of her shoulder to her neck the shoulder is not involved in the strangle with any karagatame the shoulder is involved in the strangle and this is what makes it the difference between a karagatame and a guillotine okay so we have to look at defenses to the seated karagatame and they're relatively similar to the guillotine defenses but there are major differences that we have to look at so let's run through these seated karagatame defenses right now and then we'll go into uh other karagatames, darces, anacondas, things like that after this. All right so seated karagatame most conservative defense we have is a roll through almost pretty similar to uh to the guillotine same kind of body mechanics but understand that your opponent opponent can switch to a fully locked anaconda on the roll through and now it's gonna be harder to reset in your head because your hand and your head are are smushed together okay so when she goes to from front headlock or whatever the case is she goes to lock this seated karagatame and right from here i'm immediately going to look to start pushing the knee through and now i'm just going to look to roll into this position here now the danger is she locks a figure four and now i'm in a full anaconda and i have to fight out of that which we'll look at later okay but assuming i can post to my partner's hip i can i can either one continue the roll so that as we go through the head the head ends up coming out coming back to center or two i post on the hip and from here i walk back in the opposite direction and my head pops out like so okay so depending on what kind of momentum you're looking at whether you just kind of fall over to your side or whether you whip yourself underneath if you fall to your side you'll end up moving back towards the same direction you came and it'll come up back probably to neutral from here or if you have a lot of momentum you'll end up rolling through and as you roll through locks keep stay locked you can bring your uh your head to center and then you can start moving into drags from here where you can go into arm drags and things like that and go back into counter-offense okay so you roll through the main danger is you get hit with a full anaconda your partner locks a full figure four okay so understand there is a little bit different a little bit of a difference here you're not in a guillotine anymore you're in a counter attack so from here as i gotta start rolling through either one post on the hip and now i start walking back in the opposite direction where i just came from or two i roll all the way through and as i roll all the way through i recenter my head and i immediately move to drag so she goes to hold on we drag our way out and now from here we're ready to go back into offense all right so very similar but some key differences with sidakaragatame rolling through versus guillotine rolling through all right so you can run to side control when your partner goes to lock sidakaragatame but understand that because your arm is across the body now you're going to have to continue rotating to north south in order to stabilize the position okay so you can go elbow inside the hip you can start trying to outflank your partner's leg which you can't always do sometimes you get caught but this is one good option so she goes maybe front head and we've been doing she locks in sidakaragatame now as she goes to sit right from here i block my partner's hip right from here she goes to start following me we just run run run and now our whole thing is right from here as the elbow as my left elbow comes off my partner's thigh my hand comes off the hip i just shoot my right hand across now when i can't have the big explosive guy bridging me through as i roll to my hip and i get bridged and i get severely off balance so the second i land here i don't fall to my hip i scurry to north south so now that now we're parallel i can't be bridged over my hand is still across my body all right so very similar but again some key differences that's going to make or break a tough match here so she goes in however she feeds this sidakaragatame in from here we go in and immediately what we don't want is for her to wrap legs up so the second she sits we start putting our elbow in the hip like so we pin a leg down now from here it doesn't matter if his hands across his elbows inside the hip we just pin this leg when she goes to follow me with her left leg now it's hard because her right hip can't open so when he tries to follow me i just walk we fall like so now if we fall to all the way to our hip and she gets a strong bridge we get rolled over so when i sit through i sit through i just keep shuffling shuffling shuffling to north south so i don't get bridged all the way through okay so because my arm is across my body i don't want to end up in this t position i want to end up parallel to my partner so she goes to sit this sidakaragatame she rolls it through and from here we can get to a relatively parallel position or now she goes to bridge i have my feet behind me and we can start to base out go into offense and start our attacks from top pins okay so it is possible to jump across the side control many times on a talented opponent you're going to run to that leg coming over your back and run some problems there i'm not going to say it's impossible you can as they go to lock it up you can jump across find yourself into north south okay so it is one good option now we're going to work at look at a more realistic situation where your partner throws her shin across fires her leg over and then we have to go into the escape from there all right so this time this is a little bit more realistic with the sidakaragatame i can't post my partner's name my hands across the body a lot of times when i go to jump across the side control from here i have a talented opponent who just catches me throws a shin across and fires her leg over so i'll be trying to do from here she goes to sit i'm going to block my partner's hip now the second i'm going to run to side control i block the hip but she just lifts her leg her left leg straight up in the air and she catches me this is this is more realistic situation against a high level opponent i'm not gonna say you can't run the side control and circle the north south but this is probably what's going to happen to you most of the time okay so we go in and right from here the second i feel this i have to disconnect the legs so when she goes to start strangling me i take my hand i v grip and i just run away from that leg and immediately we go into that roll we start to go into roll through and we end up with a situation where we can re-center our head if you want tape study on this um my fought philip roe in the exhibition match my stomach wasn't great uh on flow grappling we had an exhibition match where there was no uh winner with submission i let him put me in a sidakaragatame and i used his exact exact defense um to uh to end up uh back in an offensive cycle escaping and back into an offensive cycle so this is this is something that works um obviously it all works but that's a place you can study it at um so the whole thing is always create a disconnection between her legs and hips and my legs and hips so the second i feel this coming on she's strangling me my whole thing immediately let's just start walking out in this direction away from the legs and now i just look to my right towards my partner i just fall over my left shoulder and now we either roll through or move back in the same direction and i'm ready to go back into our offensive cycle once we escape okay so the second i feel strangling pressure come on she gets to cross uh cross shin we can roll through and uh clear our partner's uh their partner's knee and start our rolling sequence now there will be a time sometimes where you just feel like there's not going to be enough time to push that knee on through and the kagatame is coming on fast you're like fuck if i don't if i don't do something now i'm gonna have to tap whenever you see this whenever you see the kagatame there's always a chance or there's always an opportunity to submit yourself to back control but take away the uh the uh your opponent's ability to finish you with a strangle so i give up back control but i don't get finished with the kagatame so whenever she throws that leg across we find ourselves here whenever i see this i can just grab my partner's elbow here and i can shoot my right hand forward towards almost towards the camera so now when she has to finish me i just take my right hip and i sit through and now i don't get strangled but i relinquish back control where now she goes in and she gets my back and i have to fight from here so not great but you don't get finished in the kagatame right away so whenever i see this she goes to sit i'm gonna get started i feel like i'm pushing pushing pushing i can't do it i grab my partner's elbow and now all i think about is shooting my shoulder inside the strangle and turning belly up she goes to finish me and now i want to keep control of this if i can because now i can angle out and escape the back that's not always possible sometimes you get your back taken sometimes you uh you end up giving up back control and it is what it is but at least you're not getting strangled all right so a couple of ways we can operate here when we're in a half guard my partner locks into kagatame they start tying my legs up from here i can go into that high tripod i can use that high tripod to insert my butterfly hook and now i can free my leg and from here we can start rolling just like we did with our dc okay so whenever i see this she's going to look to start strangling me from here we high tripod now we have time that we need good to start freeing our knee from within our partner's legs and then we can go into our roll and we get ball to the shoulder and look to escape with our head another thing we can do from here is we're in half guard we're getting strangled i feel like the strangle is coming on i can't free my leg we grab our partner's elbow we shoot ourself belly up we shoot that hand that shoulder through the strangle the whole thing is while we're turning belly up i want to punch my shoulder inside the strangle and when she's struggling me kagatame the shoulder is eliminated so from here when she goes to lock up tight you guys can't see my shoulder i shoot your shoulder through and that's what that's what takes the pressure off the strangle and now from here we can start turning and we're back belly up so we're in half guard we try to free the leg try to free the leg try to free the leg if we can't do it maybe she has a scorpion locked whatever the case is grab the elbow turn belly up and shoot that shoulder inside the strangle give your back up but you don't get finished with kagatame all right so this is kind of uh it's kind of an issue here so now she gets kagatame she locks her guard and now we're like oh man this is no good okay from here posting on the knee and trying to jump across the body is going to be hard because of the fact that my elbow is on the opposite side now here it's easier to navigate myself across my partner's left side of the body because my elbow my arm i already have one arm on that side but i'm trying to do that and my partner's pulling her knees to her chest and i have my elbow caught on her hip here go ahead lock it up and she's pulling her knees into her chest you see that from here like everything kind of gets caught on this side of the body i can't get my elbow across my elbow gets stuck on my partner's hip which means i can't build height and when she gets to pull her knees in and i'm posting it's it's just like a weird awkward angle from here and you just don't have enough time to be able to clear those knees and jump across the body usually because your elbow is caught on this side when you try to build height and really get your hips up into that high tripod position it's kind of awkward the angle's not right and it just doesn't really work live okay so the second i feel this and my partner locks their legs around him around me you're gonna get finished if she has good mechanics if the mechanics are terrible and just feel it wait it out and then eventually your partner will let go but assuming the mechanics are good just give your back up okay the second i feel this the mechanics are bad i can fight that fight the hands and i can put separate my partner's wrist and then i can eventually pop out and then she's halfway to my back anyways but assuming i'm dealing with someone who's not an idiot and can actually finish from here the second i see this i just immediately turn i punch myself i or my shoulder inside that strangle and now i start turning belly up and yelling it's for my back defense from here okay so that's my number one defense i always do if you try to do the other one if your partner has no pulling of the knees to the chest and she's kind of relaxed sure you can post the knee and free your hips once she locks up tight you can't really get your hips in position to actually get them out from here your partner keeps scooting away you have no ability to stop your partner from moving your hips at least when you're here in the guillotine you can control your partner's hips on this side so now when she has to angle her hips out it's hard i can jump across the across the body when you have no control over her hips and your elbows wedge across on the other hip on the other side posting on the on the knee won't really work okay so whenever i see i'm getting strangled my partner has good mechanics has a seated kagetama and she locks her legs completely around me just give your back up fight from there and then fight to escape as you as you start rotating belly up now the only time you'd ever really be caught in an endgame with this is if you didn't know which way to go because you can pretty much always shoot your shoulder and start turning violently belly up and you can always pretty much pop your shoulder and pull the elbow and get yourself inside the shoulder inside the strangle and and give your back up the only time you'd really get finished is if you didn't know this escape and you're trying to fight out and just ran out of time or if you just didn't want to give your back up and you just wanted to get submitted instead but it's hard to get finished in a seated kagetama because of the simple fact that you can always give your partner your back so the only time you'd really get finished in a seated kagetama is if they had their legs locked or they had some kind of control over your legs and you didn't elect to just give them your back so just understand this is the endgame and it's easily avoidable by just turning your back giving your partner the back and then fighting out of the back pin all right yes all right so just some concepts with honor with anaconda and dog strangles you're obviously looking you're obviously looking to have some early defensive hand fighting and make sure that your opponent can't make sure your opponent can't lock legs around you okay um at any point they can lock anaconda or dars and actually lock legs uh around you whether it be in close guard or mount you're gonna run into some problems from here um and there it becomes exceedingly difficult when a figure four is locked to actually get out of these strangles um and you can play the level games between these two strangles and a tri-level with a guillotine so uh we're gonna run through some of these now and we're gonna look at uh you know our early defenses all the way into late stage defenses and some end games from here when uh when our partners lock the legs around us and have us a fully locked strangle so um we're gonna get headed to this now and uh should be fun all right let's look at recognizing danger and uh going into the earliest of escapes where we don't even let our partner lock either an anaconda or dars um so when your partner has a front headlock they have a choice of shooting a hand through in this fashion to lock anaconda or shooting your hand through in this fashion to lock dar strangles okay and we have to be cognizant of both of these my primary hand is here on my partner's right hand so if i had my primary hand and my secondary hand in place my partner goes to shoot it shoot that hand through for anaconda it won't happen now she has her hands locked from here and she tries to shoot her dars hand through the hand is locked she won't be able to shoot her hand through but if from here she unlocks the hands and she and she uh she pulled the right elbow up towards the ceiling and gets my primary hand out of place and then shoots that second hand through now from here you run into a problem okay so the onus is on you to understand that when you feel that hand coming that elbow pulling out in a way the second hand's coming through whenever i see that if i can i catch if the fist is closed i just catch the hand like so and i physically catch my partner's hand a lot of times the hand is open so if i go to catch i miss if i miss the fist and the hand is open i catch the wrist okay if i miss the fist i catch the wrist so when the hand goes to come through i catch and now from here i pull my elbow back when she goes to lock up i just connect my ear and my shoulder so when she goes to lock up figure four the hand can't can't the hand can't come through far enough in order for her to actually lock everything up and now from here we can just put our defensive hands in place we can pull everything back down and now we start to go in and start our escapes so my primary hand is in this defends me against anacondas and guillotines and sida karagatames okay she wants to go see the karagatame she's gonna punch that hand through and lock everything so the primary hand and the secondary hand in place will stop guillotines will stop karagatames or sida karagatames and will stop anacondas when she goes to punch any of those through just not gonna happen from here if from here she has a closed fist and she goes to punch the dars hand through many times i can catch it depending on where it is a lot of times even if her fist is closed and i go to catch maybe i miss it and then i have to go to the wrist if i miss the fist or if she has her hands open i go to the wrist and now when she goes to lock i close the space off here i just pull my elbow back to my own hip then when she goes to lock up just not going to happen and now from here we can go in start puddling out and we're ready to go into our counter-offense you're just recognizing the danger there and the understand the trilemma between your partner has the ability to go for guillotines sida karagatames and anacondas and dark strangles depending on what they do with their hand position and you have to be ready to catch hands through all those transitions all right so now uh my partner my partner looks to start punching that hand across whether it be for sida karagatame or anaconda the same initial grips happen but you can go with an early arm drag right away and i think we went over this in front head lock escapes as well um but we can go in here because it's leading right into a submission so my partner goes to start whether she punches my early hand my defensive hand off my defensive hands aren't set right and she goes starts feeding that hand through i'm just gonna post the hand out on the floor i'm gonna take a deep bite up as a high that can over my partner's elbow like so and now the second she goes to lock her hand they just post the leg out like so my head moves towards the center line and i just drag everything on by by pulling my elbow my right elbow here back to my own hip and pulling everything um through looking to get to my partner's far hip now we end up with a nice arm drag behind our partner ready to attack internal position this is a great way to transition from a front head lock where your partner's in offense and she's about to go into a situation where she's trying to submit you to as she gets to punch that hand through we just go in with a nice drag grip our head circles we use a push off of our left foot and we just whip everything on by we get behind our partner's two elbows and now we're ready to go in and go on the attack all right so another thing that we can look to do as soon as my partner locks up where you're technically now in my later stage defense because the triangle's locked with the arms but if that's super tight yet like right as she's locking i can always expose my partner's elbow or she has to feed the hands through and the second she goes to lock up that elbow it's not the fingertips aren't deep inside the bicep we can expose the elbow lock up by just pulling one two three four directly in the space where the elbow meets her arm okay i have to be very precise here so i have to try to pull my elbow directly back into this space here where my elbow exposes hers so when she goes to lock up i start turning my right shoulder down i step my left leg up and i just go in i go one two three four and i separate the hands now i catch my partner's wrist what i don't want is immediately for her to transition to a high elbow giki this is no good so i catch the wrist so when she goes to make that transition to the high elbow it's not going to happen now you can't hold this forever so my thing from here is immediately my left knee goes down my right knee comes up and then we transition to a drag back on the other side where we can get behind our partner's elbows so she feeds the arm through she locks up and we don't want to get deep into this anaconda so right from here we step up one two three four we catch the wrist when she goes to pull back it's going to be hard i can always control the upper arm now now i can't it's hard for me to go in and drag from here all right because i have weight on my right elbow i can't get to my partner's wrist from here so left knee goes down right knee goes up we chase the far hip now we're ready to go in and get to an attacking position so what this will look like she locks in we get to the situation where we're behind our partner now we're ready to go back into offense internal position all right so this time my partner locks up and whether i try to roll out or roll through my partner we end up in a situation where we're belly up so she locks a full anaconda strangle and from here we end up in a situation where we roll and we're belly up the second i find myself in this position i'm going to always look to expose my partner's elbow from here she wants to bring her elbows together so what i'm going to look to do from here is i look to lock my hands when she goes to lock up tight my whole thing from here if i just go in and i just use two hands to push one two three four five six and i just separate my partner's hands like so okay this people are gonna be oh man you should be stronger than the person this has nothing to do with that okay the whole thing is it's about where the pressure is being pushed into your partner's arm it's about directionality of force i want to look to start to shear my partner's elbow off of my partner's bicep the connection between her fingertips and her bicep is not nearly as strong as a connection as my elbow coming back towards my own hip me engaging my back muscles and using a little bit of a push with this hand so from here i lock up my hands okay i can even do with unlocked hands depending on how tight the lock is i lock up my hands she goes to lock up tight she wants my bicep and my ear connected the further my bicep is from my ear the weaker the lock will be and the more chance i have of escape so when she goes to strangle from here go ahead you see my voice is it gets constricted it's very hard for me to speak just by doing this she goes to strangle and it's not comfortable but i can still talk a little bit from here now as she goes to strangle go ahead you see from here my voice gets better and better until the hands separate we can expose the elbow and now we're out so it's all about exposing that elbow so the second i see her lock up the second she goes to start strangling go ahead we just go in and we catch and again we catch that wrist of hers we don't want to transition to go right to a guillotine and now i start getting beat from here we catch like so so now when she goes to transition to guillotine it's hard i catch the elbow as we got to move from here it's hard for her to i stop i have control over the elbow and now we can start moving up scissoring the legs getting to top position okay so when we roll belly up and we're belly up i'm always looking to expose my partner's elbow kip kip kip kip one two three four expose that elbow separate the arms and we can get good results from here even you see with a big size difference i'm gonna roll from here she goes to expose my my bicep connection uh in here yeah right there one two three four and the fingertips always slip off okay if you go above the elbow like she did at first it won't work you have to be specifically inside the elbow so your elbow comes inside if my elbow is inside yours it will never work go ahead you can be as strong as you want doesn't matter so the elbow comes to the inside position here outside position inside position go the hands always slip off and now you catch the wrist avoid the eating danger and you're out all right so now we're going to kind of combine the move we just did with the moves we did before from from guillotine uh where she locks up and now she starts to attempt to sitting she starts to sit to guard and she locks the figure four she sets the guard and starts squeezing from here with her leg over my back my whole thing from here is i push the knee out and across i look towards my partner we roll belly up and now from here she locks the figure four i take my elbow inside hers one two three i separate like so and now we always have hands elbows inside thumbs ready to go in stop my partner from walking guillotine and we're out so whenever i see she tries to sit to guard and tangle her legs around mine this is no good from here now we're out ready to go so you push your knee through just like we did we do a half roll this time because you don't want to roll through and then end up back on a full figure four um which you can you can roll through the turtle position and try to drag out but many times your partner will still have the hand locked the hands locked so i usually do a half roll one two three four then once i'm out i turtle come on top or get back to neutral all right so now this time my partner locks the figure four and drags me into a half guard okay now from here understand because the full figure four is locked it's going to be much harder for me to shoot my shoulder through okay because i'm much bigger than her i can always do it i'm just way stronger but if i have a an anaconda if i just have a seated kagetame understand this rotate understand that with the seated kagetame see how big the circle is here there's a ton of space so my partner's shoulder can come through that space but when i make a small i go from the biggest circle possible to the smallest circle possible it's much harder to shoot that shoulder through there's still a ton of space here even when i clamp my elbows down there's still all this space i go to the smallest circle possible and i lock up half guard now she tries to shoot her shoulder through and give me her back it's a very difficult thing to do okay so this escape isn't going to work when you have an anaconda but it will work when you have a seated kagetame and the reason being you have a very large circle when you go in and you lock seated kagetame and you have a very small circle with the figure four when you lock anaconda so you won't be able to punch the shoulder through nearly as easy and expose your own back to not get strangled so we have to look at what we're going to do from here all right and of course we looked at this before with guillotines the second i see this she locks half guard my whole thing from here is just to free my leg okay whether it be going in and going into a high tripod posting putting a butterfly hook in or whether it be high tripodting then starting to move across to this side bringing the elbow down and now from here looking to post and bring everything out and away okay you can also do that when i actually forgot to mention before you need that with a seated kagetame as well so if i go here she locks half guard seated kagetame i can hide tripod and i can hop over to this side and bring my elbow inside like so now my elbow is inside now we look to scoot away look to free our legs posting our partner's legs and now from here we just monitor guillotine danger and we start going in so that's another one we can do before but i actually forgot about that i just remembered um which happens often because i'm trying to compile everything that i know into these instructionals and i forget a lot of times um but one thing we can do like that oh you're on me you're in half guard she locks up so i can either one high tripod post insert fall and look to free my legs as we're doing it then i one two three four pop pop pop i separate the figure four or i can two i can't get my back up because the circle is too small with the figure with the figure four so i can't shoot my shoulder through so one thing i can do from here is i can just hop across to the side posting my partner's knee and now from here the whole thing if i free my knee by kipping i post my partner's leg she goes to control my foot and then we separate and now my whole thing is monitor the hands move out and away and circle my head out okay so because the circle is smaller than it was with the full anaconda versus the seedy kagatame you can't shoot your shoulder through and expose your own back so you have to use a high tripod method with the butterfly hook to free your leg and go into a roll belly up or you can hop across the body and you can start to escape uh just like that uh with the cd you also do it with the cd kagatame as well all right so an end game is my partner actually drags me into a closed guard because the circle is so small but the figure four i can't shoot my shoulder through and i can't expose my own back and just give her my back in addition because my elbows across the body i can't post in the leg and i can't try to hop hop hop and uh extract my hips from within my partner's knee line so once my partner locks a closed guard and they have a dars uh or uh or an anaconda that's pretty much the end of the road from there the only hope that you have is maybe you can roll to bottom position and then try to kip out and get your knees inside um but it's as pretty slim chance as you escape there because of the fact that the anaconda is so tight because of the lock of the hands you don't have much time so the pretty much the end game from here is she locks the figure four she locks a closed guard and now from here no way i can i have enough time to really do anything or have any any escape the only chance i have from here is to maybe fall across with the bottom mount and then try to go into some kind of kip but you see from here my hands are in no position to actually go into a kip from here i can't really get my hand across like so i can't really get my elbow inside maybe if you land with your up with your elbow inside your partner's hip and your or your partner's knee and your hand in the hip maybe you can try to kip kip kip kip kip and do a side kip and start to get some motion going but the chances of that are very slim okay so i'm not gonna say that it can't work to do that but it's gonna be very low percentage and you're gonna get finished a majority of the time from there so that's really the only other option i have as of right now um with uh with that if an anaconda is a well applied and you end up in closed guard or you end up in the bottom mount the chances are you're gonna get finished which is why my whole thing from here is to avoid hip to hip contact with them entangling your legs the whole thing is based around them not entangling your legs if they get control of your hips then it's gonna be a real problem so that's pretty much my end game from now if you guys have anything which is uh ultra reliable um that will work on me when i'm doing an anaconda uh then i'll believe that we can escape it but that's pretty much the end of the game end of the road for me right now um as far as me escaping anacondas if they get into a mount or if they get into a closed guard with the full figure four locked that's that's the end game from there um and maybe you can roll to bottom mount and create some kind of space but highly unlikely
