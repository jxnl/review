 What's up everybody? We are here once again with Miss Sunny and BJ Fanatics. We're going to be looking at half guard passing today. Now just like body lock passing, we've seen half guard passing before in my first passing instructional, but that was just kind of the outline of the full of the general passing system that I have. Now we're going to take a deep dive into the specifics of half guard passing. And we're going to be looking at the why of why things are done. A lot of the first, a lot of passing in the first instructional was more, okay, my opponent does this, I do this, she does this, I do this. And it was how to do things, where this is going to be more of how I do things and specifically how I do things and why I do things. Why would I play with a top head and arm, for example, versus an over under? Why would I play with an over under versus a double underhooks? Why would I move to just a cross face? So we're going to be looking at what grips to use when and specifically why would I use them in one scenario and not in another. So that's going to be a big focus of what we're doing today. We're going to look at an overview of how we're going to do things. We're going to do everything from getting chest to chest in half guard all the way to passing half guard, going into submissions, defending deep half guard, passing from deep half guard and going into submissions from there. So it's going to be a full course on completely on getting past half guard completely from all different kinds of various positions that my partner can be attacking me from. All right, so now we're going to look at a pretty general overview of what we're going to do here. We're not going to look at forcing people into half guard. That's a whole nother topic in itself and a lot of the other instructional cover forcing people on the half guard. We're going to start in a half guard and we're going to start passing right from the half guard. Now we're going to start in situations where we don't have chest to chest contact. So my partner has a high knee shield with various upper body grips and upper body grips are going to look at starting very basic and they get more advanced as we go. All right, so we're going to start with a high knee shield. My partner has no upper body frames. A high knee shield. My partner has a double shoulder post like so and a high knee shield. My partner has a cross shoulder post like so. This is the hardest to break through in terms of frames. My partner has a cross shoulder post and I can't get to cross faces and control over my partner's head. Things like this. We'll talk about this in a little while. We're going to start with the high knee shield, move through various upper body grips. We're going to move to a low knee shield. My partner usually has locked legs with the same upper body grips. Then we're going to look at a butterfly half guard, which is a butterfly hook in with the same various upper body grips as we looked at before. Okay. Then we're going to look at getting chest to chest or getting some control of my partner's head, whether it be getting in fully chest to chest or whether it be getting to this over back grip where you look to start passing from here and then going in and flattening my partner out from these positions. Okay. So we're going to look to get through our partner's upper body frames, get some kind of control over our partner's head and shoulders, and then go with the passes from there. All right. Then we're going to look at passing more chest to chest on our partner. We're actually past our partner's top leg and we get chest to chest. We're going here and now we look to start passing, whether it be from a top head and arm, whether it be from just a cross face, whether it be from double under hooks or over under hooks. We're going to use various upper body grips to start passing our partner. One of my partner has a traditional half guard with legs locked or my partner has a butterfly half guard with a butterfly hook in place. We're going to look at why I would use, when I would use certain upper body grips and why I would use certain upper body grips, uh, contingent upon my partner's upper body and lower body, uh, hand and leg position. Okay. So we're gonna look at first getting chest to chest, getting some kind of, uh, or getting some kind of control over my partner's upper body and then going into passes from there. Then we're going to look at a situation where my partner has half guard and offensively has an under hook in place and it's either one trying to come up towards me like so to start going into a wizard versus under hook scenarios, how we can either go into attacks from here on our partner with submissions or threaten submissions to put her back down on the floor or just simply returning her back to the floor and going into my passing from half guard. So she has an under hook. She's looking to be offensive from here. How actually goes to come up. I can start using situations where I can go in and start putting my partner flat down into a half guard where I'm chest to chest. I start negating this under hook and going into passing. Okay. We're going to look at this from both a situation where she has an under hook and a traditional half guard and an under hook and a butterfly half guard. And then from there, we're going to start going in situations where she has an under hook and she starts shooting into deep half guard, whether it be with a butterfly hook, whether it be with locked legs, whatever the case is, we're from here, we start going into ways of passing and shutting down our partner's attacks from a deep half guard with both our top knee down and our bottom knee down like here because our partner can switch between the two. We'll go into ways to flatten our partner out, ways to go into situations where we can get back to an under hook or we can start going into various attacks on our partner's upper body or lower body. Okay. And then finally, we're going to look at ways of going in and passing our partner. Maybe it's not from an under hook, maybe it's just we set up and use our under hook like so or going into body lock passes from half guard and our body lock instructional. We left off on forcing half guard, getting up, using a body lock, forcing a partner into half guard. We didn't do any passes from half guard, but from here we'll look at actually passing our partner when we have locked hands in a body lock, whether it be over the arm, whether it be a traditional body lock, whatever the case is we go and look to start making passes from a body lock or moving from body lock to head and shoulders and going vice versa between the two positions, whether it be moving from body lock to upper body control or moving from upper body control to a body lock. We can start playing with these two, have a look at why we would use body locks versus top head and arm or double under hooks, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So that's a general overview of how we're going to work. We're going to work first at distance, at range where a partner doesn't have, where I don't have chest to chest, chest to chest contact or any control over my partner's upper body. And then we're going to incrementally work past our partner's frames, get control of the upper body, pass from there and then go on through my partner going into attacks with either under hooks or deep half or whatever the case is. Okay. So that's a general overview and we'll get more specific as we go through. So now let's look at just some ideas here from passing half guard. Anytime we can get chest to chest and make a cranial shift in our partner, this is what we're looking for. Okay. Now in the first passing instructional, I talked about goals and talked about controlling the head and the shoulders like so. I didn't have a name, we didn't have a name for this back then, but I just talked about controlling the head and shoulders. But now we call it the cranial shift, right? Where I actually make a, uh, I make my way past my partner's frames and I actually get control over my partner's head and shoulders and I can control them. Where I shift from passing my partner's legs, getting his knee shoulder out of the way, to actually controlling my partner's head. And now I have a cranial shift where I shift from passing my partner's legs to actually controlling the head and shoulders. If we look at this in a different scenario, where I'm Toriondo for example, we come through, I hit a Toriondo and now from here I come through, I make a shift from passing my partner's legs to actually going in and controlling my partner's head and shoulders. I make this cranial shift. Okay. We can do this after we pass the legs like we just did with Toriondo, or we can do this before we pass the legs, both legs, so I pass the top leg and now from here I come in, I control my partner at the head and shoulders and I make this cranial shift. This is what I'm looking to do. I can also do this by using over back grips and hip switching past my partner's legs. So for example, I come through and now I'm not checking the chest just quite yet, but I have control of my partner's head and shoulders where I make this cranial shift and I use this over back grip to control my partner's head and shoulders. So when she goes to move away from me and make space, it's a difficult thing. And now I can make, and now I have time to come through and start controlling my partner's head and shoulders and various other ways, getting chest to chest. And now we can start working from here. But anytime that we can make a cranial shift and control my partner, whether it be with an over back grip or whether it be in a top head and arm or double under hooks, whenever I'm chest to chest and I control my partner's head and shoulder, if you can do this, this is what we're looking for. And because ultimately, if I'm fighting my partner's legs with my hands, it's gonna be a hard thing to do to actually get past those frames. You can spend minutes at a time, three, two, three, four, five minutes fighting to get past my partner's frames, my partner's upper body frame, my cross shoulder post is so annoying. And you can eat up time from here. But when I get chest to chest, I get control of my partner's head and shoulders. Now from here, it's gonna be a pretty quick thing and a pretty easy thing for me to start passing because I'm no longer fighting my partner's legs with my hands. I'm fighting my partner's legs with my legs now, where she's pinned at the upper body and now she goes to try to win a pommeling battle. It's a pretty easy thing for me to win that pommeling battle and go into passes right from there into either side control, balance, or what have you. So we're always looking to make that cranial shift. We go from passing our partner's legs, in this case, our partner's top leg, to getting control over the head and shoulders before we pass our partner's legs and then flattening our partner out and moving from there. All right, so now let's talk about carrying body weight and why half guard is not only one of the most effective ways to pass your partner's guard, but also one of the most effective ways to tie your partner out while guard passing. If you look at any other kind of guard passing, whether it be coriando passing, where I go to come in and now from here I go to start outflank my partner, it's tiring because the knees are coming to the chest, but my partner isn't carrying my body weight on her torso. She's carrying my body weight on her frames, where she goes to post to my shoulders, and now my body weight comes down into the frames. So it's tiring, but in a different way. Her knees are coming to the chest, so that's tiring, but she is carrying my weight on her frames. If I'm body lock passing, and she's seated like this, it's tiring because she has to pull her knees to her chest, and from here it's hard for me to step over the knees and force her into half guard, but she's not really carrying my body weight on her upper body. She's more carrying my body weight and controlling her hips, and it's hard for me to start stepping up and over a knee because her knees are coming into the chest. That's tiring, and it's very tiring from here, but it's not tiring in a sense where she's carrying my body weight on her torso, where now from here there's no frames in place. If she has a cross shoulder pose, for example, or any kind of upper body grip, and she has a knee shield in place, she's not carrying my body weight on her torso. She's carrying my body weight on her frames. So what we're going to look at is the idea of when we force someone, this is more tactical than it is technical. The idea of using half guard chest to chest to tire people out. A perfect example of this, I'm glad that I actually filmed this after this match, a perfect example of this is my match with Jacob Couch, where I would just get chest to chest, and I would just play from this position. I'd let him move around, let him think he's going to recover, and then from there I would go right into a pass. Then I'd actually go back into half guard, we'll talk about that in a second, and then I would go right back into a pass. Another great example is my match against Vinicius in ADCC finals, where I'm not rushing once I get chest to chest and half guard. I'm stalling here, because that's not what I do, but I'm letting my partner try to recover, tire themselves out, and carry my body weight for minutes at a time. So when she goes to move from here, I let her explode, I let her freak out, and now, once she's tired, then I go into my pass. Another great example was Jacare versus Hyan Gracie, where I believe he had double underhooks, and he actually put his knee on the floor. Hyan was one of the most explosive people ever. He freaked out, tried to move around, and then when he was exhausted, then Jacare finally passed and scored his points and won under ADCC rules. So playing with this tactical idea of whenever we can get chest to chest and half guard, and flatten someone out with any upper body grip, don't rush from here. Make your partner carry your body weight. This is one of the best ways to keep your partner pinned while passing their guard, and make them carry your body weight on their torso. And most other guard passes, they're carrying your body weight on frames, and they can be tiring in different ways through movement and things like that, forcing your partner to pull knees to the chest. But here, all of my body weight is resting right on my partner's chest and torso. So when she goes to move me around from here, I'm in a very stable position, and she goes to move around and freak out. She knows she's in a losing position, so she goes to move around, and then when I feel the time is right, now from here I start making my moves, and I start going into all my passes from there. So more of a tactical theory than technical, but just remember, when you get chest to chest and half guard, you make the cranial shift, don't be overzealous to pass your partner's guard. Sit there for 30 seconds, 45 seconds, a minute, two minutes, three minutes, depending on how long the match is. And then when you're ready, after they've moved around a lot, they've used a lot of their last ditch bridging escapes and trying to bridge and roll you or recover, that's when you pass. They bridge, bridge, bridge, and then as their energy level decreases, your passing attempts start to increase and eventually get past your partner's guard. And then as you pass them into mouth or side control, whatever the case is, they're so exhausted that there's no explosive bridge out of mouth, and maybe you get rolled over into bottom position. So just tactically thinking about that when you're playing chest to chest and half guard. Another idea we're going to play with, and this is partly tactical, partly technical, is backtracking and leg riding. Okay, so now what is backtracking, what is leg riding? Backtracking, and this is more tactical than it is technical, is when I get close to a pass and from here I think I let my partner get so close to a recovery where from here, instead of losing that position completely, I let her freak out, I let her do her bridges and whatever the case is, and now she's desperately reaching to try to recover so I don't get my points. So I backtrack into my partner's legs where I physically put myself back into a guard, and now from here I'm actually back into a half guard, but it's on my own terms. Okay, so for example, here I'm going into my partner's legs into her frames, and I feel like I'm not going to get anything done from here. So from here I go in, I go to an overback grip, I start going in, I use an ankle scoop, and I actually pass my partner's guard like so. Now I let my partner freak out, I let her move around the bridge, and I realize that from here if I stay in this position, maybe my partner turns towards me and moves to a terminal position, she comes up, tries to shoot at my leg, and now from here she goes in, she either shoots at my legs or she goes into a roll, and she recovers, and now I'm back to square one. So instead of losing that position completely, what I'll do is I'll let my partner get close to an escape and I'll threaten a pass from here. So now I'm close to a pass, my partner's freaking out trying to get to an escape, and as she's desperately reaching, instead of her having her turtle with her last-ditch effort, I let her get almost all the way to an escape, and I put myself back into a half guard. Where now from here I backtrack into my partner's legs, so now she goes to recover to a half guard, which I allow her to do, but it's on my own terms. Where I step back into my partner's guard, but now instead of fighting against my partner's frames, that top leg, the cross shoulder post, now I'm chest to chest with inside position where we can go through and start getting to our top head and arm and various upper body grips. Okay, conversely, we go in, we start passing, we go into a high tripod maybe, and from here I go in, I snap the floor, I pass into mount. From here I let my partner start bridging and moving around, and from here I let her trap my ankle again. She puts me back into a half guard, and from here she goes to start recovering. I let her get 90% of the way to an escape, but I don't let her trap my knee. I keep my knee free. So she's bridged, she used all that extra effort, and now from here I just backtrack into my partner's legs. When she goes to recover, she can't make a full recovery, and now she used all that extra energy and all I have to do is insert a butterfly hook and remount. Okay, she's using the Jacob Couch Match a lot, where I just let him recover into a half guard, make it, he can get to an escape, he's at 70, 80, 90% of the way through an escape, and then I just repass again. So you pass like so, you let your partner, your partner doesn't want to get scored on, right? So she freaks out, she's bridging, she goes to trap an ankle, I give her the ankle. She goes to recover, she almost makes a full recovery. Now she goes to recover fully, we just go in, we repass, and we can score more points and work right from there. Okay, so that's backtracking, it's tactical. Now technically, leg riding is a completely different art in itself. Where from here, we can use various leg pummeling situations, where we come through, we pass, and now as my partner goes to start trapping me in half guard, instead of actually putting my ankle back in half guard, we can go in and we can start leg riding. Where I physically ride over my partner's legs like so. Where I go in, I split my partner's legs, I start riding my partner's legs like so. I put my partner in a situation where I'm technically entangled inside of her guard, but she has no real control over me. Then she has to move around from here, it's difficult. I can leg ride like this. I can leg ride like this. I can leg ride like this. There's plenty of ways I can leg ride where I'm technically entangled in some form of guard against my partner, but she has no real meaningful connection or control over my legs with her legs. Where now, when she goes to move me around from here, control me, it's a pretty difficult thing to do. It's a pretty easy thing now to start going in and getting my passes as I want them. So we can play in combinations where I backtrack into the legs, and I give my partner a half guard, and I give my partner a little bit to gain a little bit. Maybe instead of losing the position completely, we backtrack into the legs, and I end up back in half guard, but we're chest to chest. And we can combine backtracking with leg riding. Where from here, we go in, we get close to a pass, and maybe we pass our partner, she goes to freak out, she traps my ankle again. From here we go in, reach for your legs, and now we're leg riding. Now she has to freak out and explode to open up and not get passed. Then we go back into a pass. We backtrack back into the legs, and over the course of five minutes or 10 minutes, you let your partner think they're going to recover, and then 10 minutes in, they've made countless almost escapes, now they're completely exhausted, and now when you actually choose to pass, you've been leg riding and backtracking the whole time back into their guard, but on your terms. So now when you actually do pass, they're so exhausted they have no defensive posture, and it's pretty easy to go into submissions or back kicks or whatever you want from there. All right, so you've heard me talk about this I don't know how many times, but everything is going to come down to the battle for inside position. When I'm looking to pass, I'm looking to pass half guard, I have to win the battle for upper body and lower body inside position. Think about it. If I'm in half guard, and my partner has the inside position, she has leg inside, she has hand inside my shoulder, she has elbow inside my shoulder, or she has two hands inside my shoulders and I can't get any control of her upper body, she's winning the battle for inside position. If I take a hand inside her knee and an elbow inside her hip, and now from here I take an elbow and hand inside, and I get an underhook, like so. From here I can go inside my partner's shoulder, I can put a cross face in like so. I can win the battle for upper body inside position, you have more of an advantage now. But now from here I've won the battle of upper body inside position, and we both have a piece of inside position at the lower body. If she can put a butterfly hook in, and now she's winning the battle at the lower body for the inside position. So I'm winning the upper body battle for inside position, she's winning the lower body battle for inside position. So she has a chance now of going in and off-balancing over the left shoulder, and fighting back to the inside position with her upper body, and now from here she can go in and either enter into my leg to go into a butterfly guard or whatever she wants from there. If however, I win the battle for lower body inside position, or I go into a high tripod for example, and she tries to insert her butterfly hook and she can't do it, and now I pommel my butterfly hook in, now my two legs are inside hers. So I win the battle for lower body inside position, and now I can start dominating either the far hip or the near hip, and now I'm almost guaranteed to pass. So if I can win the battle for upper body inside position, and the battle for lower body inside position, it's going to make it much easier for me to start passing my partner's guard. So it all comes down to winning the battle for inside position. If she can win the battle for inside position like so, and I can't get any control of her upper body, it's going to be hard for me to pass from here. But if I can incrementally fight my way to the inside position, however it may be, if I can incrementally fight my way to the inside position, however it may be, at the upper body, and then I can win the battle at the lower body for inside position, it's going to be much easier for you to pass from here. If we both steal a piece of the inside real estate at the lower body, let's say she put the butterfly hook in, and I put my butterfly hook in. Now again, I have to focus on fighting back to the inside position. My right foot goes inside, and now from here, I pop with my right knee inside. Now I have two legs inside hers, now I want you guys to recover and stop me from passing. It's a pretty easy thing for me to go in and pass from there. So you're playing a simple game of winning the battle for the inside position. If she from bottom position can keep her limbs inside mine, she can dominate the exchanges and go into either sweeps or submissions or whatever she wants from there. But if I can fight my way past those frames, get to the inside position at the upper body, and then win the battle for lower body and upper body inside position, you're going to be in the driver's seat and most likely pass your partner. If she can win the battle for inside position, she's going to be attacking you the whole time and it's going to be hard for you to get any kind of passes from half guard going. You're going to have to stand up and start touring on those or do some other kind of passing from there. So it's a simple battle for inside position. If she can win, she'll dominate the exchanges. If I can win, I'll dominate the exchanges. So now let's look at two general ways. We're going to look at framing in a second, but two general ways that we can get chest to chest on a talented opponent. One is by crashing the far shoulder and two is by hip switching and going to an over back grip. All right, so my partner, when she's looking to play from half guard, will always look to have a far shoulder elevated off the floor coming towards me to either switch to scoop grips and switch to under hooks or play with a cross shoulder post. So if I can quickly get past this top leg and crash my partner's far shoulder with my head like so, I can start to shuffle towards my partner's legs to flatten that far shoulder out. And I once have that far shoulder flattened out, it's a pretty easy thing for me to put a reliable cross face in place. It's a pretty easy thing for me to start taking an inside bicep tie and controlling that far shoulder. So now, either my head position or my hand position or a combination of the two, when she goes to start moving out towards me and taking that shoulder off the floor, it's a pretty easy thing for me to keep that shoulder pinned and then move into a situation where I can flatten her out. When she tries to reinsert a knee shield from here, it's hard. She can shrink her hips out, I can just follow the hips. And because she can't make space at the upper body, it's hard for her to actually reclaim that inside position and fight to an offensive cycle. So one way that we can easily get chest to chest on our partner is by getting past frames and just crashing our head or hand to the far shoulder. So we're playing in here, I'm playing a game where I go in and I beat my partner's forearm, for example. I push the cross shoulder post down. Or she's a double shoulder post and from here we come in and we get inside. And then right from here I just crash the far shoulder. So as she goes to recover, I just put my head here in the far shoulder. When she goes to start bringing her shoulder off the floor and recovering from here, I just circle, circle, circle, and then we work our way into a tight passing position where we're chest to chest. So a general way of getting chest to chest, the first one is crashing the far shoulder. Now we won't always be able to do that. A lot of times I try to go through those frames and from here I can't get through the frames. If I do get past one frame, I come in with a knee shield in the way and I feel like I can't get past and I can't crash the far shoulder. Whenever I see this, I use hip switching methods where from here I get first to an overback grip where I reach over my partner's back with this left hand here. And now I control my partner's head and shoulders. So I use this overback grip to then start flattening my partner out and incrementally walking my partner's legs away. I beat my partner's top leg and now from here we can go in, we can get to a cross face or under hook, whatever the case is, and start flattening my partner out chest to chest. All right. So if I feel like I can't just immediately go in and use a linear approach where I just drive towards my partner's far shoulder and lift the pommel hands. If I can't get in and crash that far shoulder, then I use a different approach where I hip switch around my partner's guard and I use overback grips like so. And I use a thread of passes or submissions to start going in and as my partner goes to recover, I flatten my partner out and then from here I can go in and get chest to chest and go to work. Okay, so two very general ways of thinking. I usually start with a linear approach where I try to go in and I try to crash my partner's far shoulder. So now she's going to push me away, move around. I crash the far shoulder and now we can get chest to chest. Many times you won't be able to do this. So from here, I feel like I can't get past those springs. Maybe she's just a cross shoulder pose. I can't get inside. From here I start a pull push game where she goes to push me away and I hip switch and I use this overback grip. And now from here when she goes to move me around, I have control over the head and shoulders and it takes time now. It's a pretty easy thing to go in, start getting chest to chest. Maybe she goes to push my knee down and from here she gives us an underhook. Now we can go in, get chest to chest and start passing. The crashing the far shoulder and hip switching to an overback grip are two very general ways and two very general and effective ways of getting chest to chest with my partner, stealing the inside position and working to pass right from there. Now we've looked at some general theory of half guard passing. Now let's look at what upper body frames my partner will be using. Assuming they're good, we're going to work from basic to more advanced. Everyone who's good is going to be using a cross shoulder pose and we'll look at that in a minute, but we have to run through the most basic ones first because not everybody you're going to be training against or competing against is going to be advanced. To be honest, a lot of the guys that compete against just don't use advanced defensive framing, so it's important that we go through from basic all the way to advanced. The first is my partner just has either, she could have a butterfly hook, a low knee shield, a high knee shield, doesn't matter. A lot of times you have people who don't even really use a defensive pose at all, where they just play a game where their hands are in like this and you have almost no upper body defensive framing and the hands are in, but I can come forward and I can manage distance between my chest and their chest. The first thing we're going to look at, if my partner just has really no upper body defensive frames and we can easily fight to the inside position and come forward and get our hands inside, even if the hands are close like so, it's a pretty easy thing. Obviously I can't hug around and outside, now I can't get control of my partner, but it's a pretty easy thing to come forward and fight to the inside, crash your foreshoulder, come to the inside and then work to get past my partner's upper body frames. Okay, so just no defensive hands, the upper body just pinch tight elbows is our first upper body frame. So there's just basically no frames, but she has elbows inside. The second, which is pretty common, is a double shoulder post. Where from here, I try to come forward and she has a double shoulder post like so. This can be annoying and it controls your shoulder line. Ultimately, what she's trying to do from bottom position is manage distance between my chest and her chest. All right, so I'm trying to get my chest, obviously chest to chest, she's trying to manage distance by controlling my shoulder line, the line that draws my shoulders together through various upper body posting grips. Okay, so a good way to do this is with a double shoulder post. Now a double shoulder post, it will manage distance between my chest and her chest, but there's a few drawbacks of this. Number one, it has a greater chance of slippage. Where from here, if I come forward and I just take my hands inside, I can just bat her hands out and away. And now, if I beat the knee shield first, for example, the knee shield here, I come in, if I take my hand inside the knee shield and I just bat everything out and away, now I can come forward and get to the upper body inside position and I can win that battle and crash the far shoulder. In addition, she has two hands occupied. So she has no ability to start scooping into my leg. If she scoops into one leg, I just turn my shoulder and the hand slips off. So she needs to have two hands on my shoulder and she can't really use her opposite hand for anything. So double shoulder post is pretty common. It gives you more range. You can push apart or further away, but it takes both of your hands being occupied and there's less attacks that you can hit from there. And the chance of the hand slipping off the shoulders, if I turn my shoulders or take the inside position, the chances of the hand slipping off become pretty high. So it gives you more range than a cross shoulder post, but it has some drawbacks. Anyone who's good is going to be using a cross shoulder post. A cross shoulder post, the chances of that slipping off are almost nothing. You have to physically move it out of the way with your body with intricate palm-humbling and hand-fighting to actually move the cross shoulder post off of your collarbones. In addition, your partner has a free hand now where she can look to stop you from one, getting to the head with an inside bicep tie. Two, she can use it to scoop the far leg and use it to off balance you and go into entrances into deep half guard or ashi grami or whatever she wants from there. In addition to that, it's going to be very hard for me to fight inside this cross shoulder post. If she has a straight shoulder post, I just come inside the knee, I come inside the hand, and then from here I just bat the hand out and then we have the inside position where we can crash the far shoulder. This cross shoulder post makes it incredibly difficult for me to crash the far shoulder, incredibly difficult for me to get to my partner's head and shoulders, make a cranial shift, it makes it hard for me to do anything. Anyone good is going to be using this cross shoulder post. We'll start very basic and we'll move from just tight elbows, no upper body framing, to double shoulder post like so, which will give you more range but there's some major drawbacks, and then to a cross shoulder post here, where now your partner doesn't have the ability to create as much distance between you and them, but she's a free hand to work with, it's very hard for me to get to the upper body and there's no slippage problems that you generally run into with the double shoulder post. Okay, so we'll go through with those three grips, we'll work from a high knee shield first, then we'll go to a low knee shield, then we'll go in to a butterfly hook and we'll work on either getting to an overback grip or getting chest to chest and then going into passes from there. All right, so now let's look at the format of which we're going to run through getting chest to chest versus this low knee shield, high knee shield, no shoulder post, double shoulder post, cross shoulder post. We're going to look at stuffing methods, where I physically stuff my partner's leg down, where I stuff my partner's leg through. I'm stuffing my partner's leg in various positions to get reactions, where I go to stuff my partner's leg down, she goes to open up the knee, from here I take the inside elbow position, I can come forward and get to a situation where I can get upper body inside position. So I can look to stuff my partner's leg and come forward and get to that far shoulder. I can look at rising methods, where from here I can quickly pop up to split squat positions, let's say I can't get the inside position and my partner's leg, and from here I quickly pop up, then from here I run into a situation where I get the inside elbow position, and now from here we come back down and we can get to a partner's far shoulder. So we can use stuffing methods where I physically stuff the leg down and out of the way. I can use rising methods where I quickly pop up, and I use that to get the leg out of the way. I can use hip switching methods, where from here I can't get past my partner's frame, so rising method is not working, I can't stuff the leg down, because then she has upper body grips in place. So we can use hip switching methods, where from here I hip switch, I get to over back grips, and I beat my partner from there. In addition, we can use a combination of hip switching, where I throw my outside hip down, like so, and if she has a low knee shield, for example, and she has her legs locked, we can use hip switching in the opposite direction, where instead of my outside hip coming down, my inside hip can drop down, and I can use hip switching and sprawling method to start going in and collapsing my partner's legs together, and then pommeling and going into passing from here. So we're going to look at first, very basic methods where I just stuff my partner's leg either down, or I stuff my partner's leg, I come forward past it, I just stuff my partner's leg into positions where we can beat her. Then we're going to go to more advanced rising methods where I can't get the leg out of the way, so from here we have to start quickly popping up, moving situations where we can come in, and now going in and coming forward. And then more advanced, where I have to start hip switching past my partner's legs, going into over back grips, like so, by dropping my outside hip, or in the case of low knee shields, dropping my inside hip, hip switching, and from here going to work, pommeling, using sprawling methods to go through, and start leg pommeling and leg running with our partner to get into passes. Okay, the general ways we're going to work, starting from high knee shield, working into low knee shield, and going into butterfly half guard, working from no shoulder post, double shoulder post, cross shoulder post, and using those three methods to break it down a little bit more simply for you guys. We're going to start off with stuffing methods where I just move my partner's leg out of the way, and we get to upper body inside position, and start to go into our passes. So these are very basic, I'm just going to combine a bunch of moves into this one clip here instead of breaking it down all into a 30 minute segment, because most people are going to be playing with some kind of upper body framing, but there are people who don't, and just wait for you to come in reactively, so I want to cover this. But understand that it is important to know these kind of combinations to get pass your partner's top leg, because they are going to come into play later when you're dealing with various upper body frames. So we have a knee shield in place, a high knee shield in place, where her leg is running up across to my far shoulder like so. Low knee shield will be more along the line of my hips, and she'll have usually her legs locked with a low knee shield. We have a high knee shield, and we can't get to my partner's upper body. Whenever I see this, I'm going to play a game where one, I just take an elbow inside my partner's hip, and a hand inside my partner's knee and hip like so. And now from here, as I'm going to come forward, I just take a hand right inside my partner's hand, and now we start moving, so we have two hands inside. And now from here we just come forward and crash our partner's far shoulder. So now from here once you guys start moving around, it's a pretty easy thing to come forward to get control over my partner, and we can go in and start flattening our partner out like so. We're going to get more advanced when we move on in terms of fighting to upper body grips, moving from an inside bicep tie to a ten-finger grip to an underarm crossface. But just working very simply from here, is we come in and we look to start taking an elbow inside like so. She has elbows inside, and we can come through, and we can either one, come through and put two hands inside and move all the way right to my partner's upper body. Additionally, we can come through with an elbow inside, and we can start moving to our partner's upper body. If I feel like I can't get a crossface, I can't get hands inside, we can just take our right knee to our partner's far hip and flatten our partner out like so. So now from here when she goes to shrimp away from me, I have knee and elbow connection, I have control over my hips, and I'm past my partner's top leg. And now when she goes to move away or push me away, I can use time now, I have time on my side to start fighting in and getting close to my partner and making those upper body connections. So I can either one, just take an elbow inside and just go right to my partner's upper body by taking the hands inside, and then from here just crashing the far shoulder like so, or if I can't get right to the upper body and make that cranial shift, I go to the hips first. From here we come inside, I take my right knee across to the far hip and I just flatten my partner's hips like so. I form a knee elbow connection over here. So when she goes to shrimp away, she can't do it now. And now as she goes to move away, now I have time on my hands where I can play this pommeling battle as she goes to start blocking my crossface, I go up towards the crossface, then I come down and I pommel through and I pommel around. And now from here we get to the crossface, we can put an inside bicep tie in place, we can start opening up our partner's elbow and moving in. And again, we're going to look at more pommels later. And she's just getting initially chest to chest and getting past our partner's top leg. So that's one, just taking an elbow inside and getting the inside position relative to our partner's hips. Now there's many times where I'm trying to get a hand inside, my partner's tracking my hand with her leg. So I try to go inside and she transitions to a low knee shield and she moves back and forth between high knee shield, low knee shield, high knee shield, low knee shield. So whenever I go in here, I try to get inside and she closes the knee down, I feel like I can't get inside. Whenever I see this, I look to start stuffing my partner's leg down. So I look to start forcing her into a situation where I start pushing the knee down and now if she stays in this position, I can start crushing the legs together by using hip switching and sprawling methods and it's bad for her. So many times she will want her legs to be crushed together. So I'm going to push the leg down, as she goes to extend the leg through, we take the inside elbow position and now from here we can get to the upper body, chest to chest position that we love so much. All right? So we can play a game where I'm pushing into my partner and from here she has everything in tight and I push into my partner. I feel like I try to go inside, I can't do it. I'm going to crush the legs together by just taking a forearm over my partner's knee and a leg like so. So now she goes to extend the leg through to stop the legs being crushed together and when I see that, we just take the inside elbow position and now from here we go in and we let's just start sliding our partner out. Okay? We can also use a method where instead of extending her leg through, she opens the knee. So I go from here, I try to crush the leg down, she instinctually opens up the knee and then from here I just swim the hand to the inside, we take the inside elbow position and from here we go and crash the far shoulder or just control my partner at the hips and then we can switch to either tight waist, body lock, we can go make transitions from there. Okay? We can play a game where you just come directly inside. Most people won't let you do this but some people will and we can play a game where we have to start stuffing the leg down. She goes to extend, we take the inside elbow. She goes to open up the knee, we take the inside elbow. Okay? This is a way to just off balance your partner's leg, create a kizushi to get the inside elbow. Okay? There's also situations where we can use a bottom hand, where we use our outside hand to start bumping our partner's knee out and away. So I come in here, I start playing with it. Instead of using this hand, she thinks I'm going to be using my right hand to start moving her leg around and from here we can come in and we can just bump our partner's knee to the outside. Whereas we bump our partner's knee to the outside, we have a choice of either one, going over the knee, like so, where she goes to push me away. I'm playing here, I can't get inside. We just bump our partner's knee to the outside. We just cover, like so. Now we can flatten our partner out or we play a game where there's more distance between us, maybe I'm not pushing into my partner so hard and from here we just take a hand to the inside and we're scooping our partner's leg and we use that same bump where we bump with the outside hand. We just bump the knee outside, we take the elbow to the inside position and now from here we go and flatten our partner out. So we can play a game where we're playing in here, we start pushing into our partner and we start using scoop grips. We start using V grips and playing with our partner here and we just quickly bump our partner's knee to the outside and we come forward and crash to foreshoulder and get chest to chest or hip switch, whatever you want to do from there. And then finally we can play a game where I'm pushing into my partner, I have a hand on my partner and I either use a V grip on my partner's ankle to just shove the ankle down with the V grip or I can physically pull my partner's leg on by with my top hand. So I'm pushing into her, I get a push back reaction and I just pull the hand on by and from here we come in and we crash down chest to chest and we start playing. And a combination of these, I know it seems very very basic right now, but it's going to be important, these Kazushis, when our partner does have more advanced upper body frames. But I want to run through these right now so you get the basic idea of creating Kazushi with your partner's top leg and every time I get a reaction in one direction it allows me to come back and make space. Maybe I'll combine these together, maybe I'm going to push the leg down and as she goes to open I'll use an outside hand bump and then we'll pommel to the inside. Maybe from here I get a push in, I get a collapse of the leg, she goes to open and I pull the leg through. So we can play a game, we start playing, we start moving into our partner and now from here we're in. And this is going to make a big difference when our partner starts using a cross shoulder pose for example because I'm looking to get past this knee elbow connection. So this Kazushi here is going to be important for me to start going through and getting past my partner's top leg and creating disconnections between this knee and elbow right here. So just with no shoulder pose my partner's doing a good job of keeping everything inside, just playing a game or playing around with my partner's top leg. We're moving through and we're getting chest to chest. We're getting chest to chest. We're getting chest to chest. Again I know it seems basic but these are some ways to create Kazushi whether you push your partner's leg down, whether you push your partner's knee out, whether you pull your partner's knee through. There's many different ways that we can go but we combine this all with a pushing towards our partner's shoulder. We threaten trashing the far shoulder as we get that push back reaction we go in one direction or the other. Then we can get chest to chest and start passing from there. So very basic starting out, high knee shield and no shoulder pose using basic Kazushi with the hands, both hands to start pulling our partner's knee in one direction or the other and then getting chest to chest and either covering the hips first or if we can going right to the upper body inside position. All right so now we're going to look at quickly popping up to a split squat and then dropping back down into half guard to beat my partner's leg. Now with no shoulder pose again this is pretty basic but we're going to run through it anyways. We feel like for whatever reason we can't use any of the previous methods to get past our partner's top knee shield. Maybe my partner is in general playing with no shoulder pose but every time I go to beat my partner's leg maybe she just posed upon her shoulder so I got to beat the leg. I pull it through and now I run into a shoulder pose and she brings the leg back in. So it's hard for me to beat this leg initially with the previous methods. One way that we can deal with this is by just popping up to a split squat briefly and then moving back down after we beat our partner's top leg. So we play a game where from here if I can get an elbow inside that's a pretty easy thing for me to just come forward and beat my partner. So many times I won't be able to get an elbow inside I just pose the hand here my partner's hip. From here I pose on my partner's bottom leg. What I don't want to happen is I go to pop up and my partner brings the bottom knee in and she recovers to a full open guard and now you've lost your half guard. So I initially pin my partner's bottom leg down and I just step up with my right foot and I put my knee here on my partner's hip. So the whole time she gets to recover into a full open guard she can't do it. The first thing I do is I just pose the hand on the hip, pose the hand on the top of the thigh and I just bring my knee up like so. Now from here I step my left leg up and we move into a split squat position here. Now I play a game where from here I can start moving my partner around. I can pose my partner's hip and I can start lifting my partner's bottom leg and I can run her knees to point up towards the ceiling and we can take our right elbow back to the inside position now. We can play a game where I start to run my partner's knees up as she goes to point them down. Now from here we can start going in and going to my partner's leg and start playing a game where I can start pulling my partner's leg by. We can start dropping down. We can play a combination of the previous hand fighting sequences with a rising method to start creating situations where I can get up, get elbows inside and now from here I can shove my partner's knee down. Now as I'm going to move back to half guard from here I don't want to put my right knee down and have her knee come through this big hole that I just created between my knees and then she goes back into some kind of open guard. So from here I have to make sure that when I move down to half guard I take my right knee down to the far hip and I take my left knee, my partner's near hip, to actually solidify half guard once again. And now from here we're past our partner's top leg and we've made contact chest to chest where we can go in and fight the pass. So we can play a game where I quickly pop up and I use the rising method to go from a half guard, I rise up, I fight my elbow to the inside. I rise up and from here I'm playing this pushing game, she goes to push back into me, I pull my leg past and now we're in. I play this rising game, I push into her, she goes to start pushing into me, I go to crush the leg by. She goes to extend the leg through and we go through and now from here we can cover and get chest to chest. So we rise up quickly, we move from a half guard, a true half guard, into a split squat and we use a combination of the hand fighting we just used with taking our partner's knees back to center, pulling elbows inside and using a combination of all of these hand fighting methods to get past that top leg, get chest to chest and work from there. So now let's look at a way we can start switching our hips to get past this top knee shield. Now this is going to be one of the best ways that we can get past our partner's top knee shield when she starts using her cross shoulder throw. So getting the mechanics on this are important right from the beginning. She's going to have a high knee shield in place and for whatever reason I can't get past my partner's top knee shield, maybe she goes incrementally between, like I said, using tight elbows so I can't expose darses or front headlocks or kimuras or anything like that. Then I go to come forward and she posts my shoulder and I can't get past his upper body grips. Whenever I see this, I'm just going to go in and I'm going to play a game where I play this pull push dynamic here. Where from here I push into my partner, she pushes back into me, I push into my partner, she pushes back into me and then from here I'm just going to go in and either right away just go right into a hip switch and go into an overback grip or I can look to start pulling my partner's knee by as I go to hip switch, it'll make it a little bit easier. So I play this game where I push into her, she pushes into me, I push into her, she pushes into me and then when I'm ready I just pull this knee by and I switch and overback to her plug zone. Now your partner, the way you do this is going to be specific. Your partner from here is going to be trying to make space between her upper body and your upper body. They know, okay, my head and shoulders are controlled now, let me start extending away from my partner. They'll be pushing on your hips, they'll be using a knee shield to make space and they'll be doing all kinds of things from here to try to get that head and shoulders free. The first thing I do is I cover my partner's head, I cover the top of my partner's head, the crown of my partner's head with my elbow. I go to the longest end of the lever and I control her there. When she goes to start moving away from me now, it's going to be a very difficult thing. What I don't want to do is control my partner at the shoulders so that from here she can easily move away from me and start to give me issues. I switch this over back grip and I make sure I precisely control at the top of my partner's head and I crunch the chin to the chest. From this position, when she goes to move away from me, it's going to be a very difficult thing from here. This is the position you want initially when you move this over back grip. Now from here we can start to play various kinds of games where you can move to the upper body, flatten our partner out and work from here. We'll work on flattening our partner out and climbing to upper body, grips chest to chest right after this clip. Now we get to this over back grip, let's just look at a few basic ways to flatten our partner out. Your partner has a couple of choices here. Most of the time what they're going to be looking to do once they get to this over back grip is they'll start by trying to extend away from me. When they realize they can't do this, they have a couple of choices. Most people will try to keep a knee shield in so that when I go to flatten them out, I come onto the knee shield and I can't flatten them out. The first and most basic is your partner lets the knee drift away like so and now I just take my right knee and I just cover up my partner's left hip. I just physically walk them down and I beat the knee. Right now, she had the inside position with her knee relative to my hip. If she forsakes that inside position, it's a pretty easy thing. You just flatten her out. So first, the upper body is in good position but she is lazy with the knee position. Whenever I see this, I just move. I chase my partner's far hip with my knee, I form a knee elbow connection and now we have control over our partner's hips and we're chest to chest. Now we have to work to the upper body. The easiest way from here for me to work to the upper body is to use an inside bicep tie method where from here she has elbows tight, I feel like I can't get inside. From this position, whenever I see this, I try to go in and I distract her at the crossface. If I can get to a collar tie or get to a crossface, I can just pull myself in. I can start working with the crossface and now I can fight to go to the underhook later. Everyone knows the crossface is coming in. So what everyone does is I try to crossface and I can't get to the crossface. If I can pommel underneath and around and get to a collar tie or crossface and pull myself in, great. But most people will go up as I go up and follow me down and I can't get to the crossface. That's fine. I use the crossface as a distraction. Whereas as I'm going to move to the crossface, I just take my right hand and just move inside my partner's bicep like so. And now from here, once I'm inside the bicep, when she goes to use a cross shoulder post or goes to use an underhook, for example, she can't do that. And now I just crash my partner's far shoulder. I physically take a backhand frame of my own head like so. So when she goes to get that shoulder off the floor, I just crash her far shoulder and keep that far shoulder down pinned on the floor. And now from here, I play a game where I work my partner's elbow open. Now as a waiting game from here, when she goes to move away from me and shrimp, I just walk. I just walk with her. So when she goes to shrimp away and bring the knee in, it's difficult. So she can't bring the knee in, she can't shrimp away. When she goes to sit up and get that far shoulder off the floor, she can't. I have all the weight on it. And now she's just waiting to get out pummeled here. From here I go in, I try to go up towards the cross face, I can't do it. From this position, I try to go down, I can't do it. From here, I grab the tricep and I look to start lifting. She goes to keep that inside bicep high, I lift and I clear. Just enough, pummel inside. So I look at these three methods. One, if I get it, great. She doesn't follow me, I get it, I move to a cross face. Two, she follows me, I go through and around, I get to a cross face. Three, she follows me with the elbow, I lift the elbow and I just shuck everything forwards. So now she has to keep a strong lock of the inside bicep high. We give a quick Kazushi and we take the hand inside. And we just play between these three. When she has to stop me from getting in, good. She comes through and we lock the cross face in place. We control our partner's far shoulder with an inside bicep tie and we lock our hands over the far shoulder. So now when she goes to start moving up towards me and getting that shoulder off the floor, I have all my weight over the far shoulder and we effectively crash the far shoulder. Now if she's naive, she'll take her wrist out and I can just go to underhook. If she's smart, she will keep that inside position with her left hand relative to my jaw. So now if I try to switch to underhook, I unlock my hand, she pushes and makes space for the knee to come back inside. This is no good. So it doesn't seem like much having this wrist inside that makes a big difference. If I take my hands out and unlock them, she will always make space for that knee to come back inside. It would always be drastic and that much movement, but it looks something like this. Then you lose position altogether. So from here, first thing we do is we open up the elbow. Now when she goes to bring the knee inside, and I still have my hands locked, she can't bring the knee inside. I take my head and I first take my chin inside my partner's wrist, inside and underneath my partner's wrist like so. I take my head inside underneath my partner's wrist like so, and now from here we jog forward. The biggest danger from here is that when I'm going to lock my hands, my partner will exploit the space between my ear and my shoulder. So what happens is I go in, I go to punch my underhook in place, she exploits that space and she takes her hand back to the inside position. So I open up the elbow, I take my chin and my head to the inside position, and now from here I lean forward and I connect my ear and my shoulder. When she gets to exploit that space now, it's impossible. Now from here, I just cut my partner's shoulder. I lift ever so slightly, that gives me space for my hand to come through, now we have a top-headed arm locked in tight. When she goes to bring her hand back to the inside, she can't. From here, she just pummels her hand back inside right away, and now I'm back to square one. So I go in and I connect ear and shoulder together. When she goes to bring everything back inside, she no longer can fight back to the inside position. So from here, I get to this over-back grip, we'll have to start playing a game where we chase the hips first. This is the easiest way to control a partner initially, and then get to the upper body, chest to chest position, the inside position. So from here, at any point my partner's knee drifts away from the inside position and she forsakes the inside knee position, I just flatten my partner out by just driving my knee across my partner's far hip like so. Now I go knee to elbow connection, when she goes to shrimp away, she can't do it. Now we're playing a game, we're trying to go to a cross face. We can get to a kala thai or get to a cross face and then pull ourself in. Now we can just flatten our partner out and we can work from here because we have control of the head and shoulders. Most of the time, I can't get to my partner to a cross face like so. What happens is we take an inside bicep tuck, we take a backhand frame. Your partner will be trying to viciously shrimp away from you from here and get the shoulder off the floor and face you. So I need to take a backhand frame and now from here, I just go in and I lean body weight to my partner's far shoulder. When she goes to start moving out and away from me and framing and doing all those things people like, it's not an easy thing to do from here. Now I play a game where I fight to the cross face. I go up first. If she doesn't follow me, I go kala thai and I pull myself into a cross face. If she follows me, I pommel around and underneath and we go to a cross face. She follows me up and down and she's a sticky inside bicep thai, I lift and I drive everything forwards to create a disconnection and I pommel inside and from here, we go in and we lock up. We lock up with a 10 finger grip and we play a game right from here. She goes to move around. It's not an easy thing to do at all. And now we open the elbow. We fight to the inside position like so. We lean forward and before we do anything, we get that ear shoulder connection. And she has to move around from here, pommel the hand back inside. Not going to happen. And from here, we're in ready to go, so that's chasing the hips first. Now understand if at any point your partner keeps the knee in place, but I want to quickly flatten my partner out, you can just go in and V grip your partner's ankle, attempt to push that knee down. You won't always be able to do this and we have options later for this. But we go in with a quick V grip and we just push our partner's ankle down. Conversely, we can go in and we can push our partner's knee physically with a V grip on the knee where the knees, if the knee is deep inside, I won't be able to access the knee. I have to go to the ankle. Okay. We understand that the ankle is not as strong because you run out of range of motion. So as I go to start walking and she pulls the knee back in, I can end up getting caught. So sometimes I go to the ankle first, then I go to the knee. Now she has to bring that knee back inside. I have a much more range of motion I can get with that pushing the knee and I can drive my knee across like so. And now from here we can go in, play a game, we go to that inside bicep tie and we can work from here. Okay. So at any point, I feel like my partner's knee is on the inside and I want to quickly push it out. You won't always be able to push it out, but if I want to and it's not deep inside, I can go either to the ankle or the knee, put that here somewhere, or I can go to the ankle first, then the knee. And now from here we go in, we push and we drive. Now if I want to go right to flattening my partner out, if at any point I see my partner's elbow drift behind her rib cage in this fashion, whenever I see this, instead of flattening my partner out and going to the hips first, like we did where I flattened my partner out, I control the hips first, then I move to the head and shoulders. If at any point I see my partner move to a situation where her elbow comes behind her rib cage, I just take an inside bicep tie right away. And now from here, if the knee comes out of my hip and I feel like, oh, I can flatten my partner out, I just move right to an inside bicep tie, I flatten my partner out, and then we immediately just swim across through a cross face. And now from here, we work in the same scenario. So I look at my partner's upper body and lower body positions from here. She should be in a situation where she has a knee inside my hip and good elbow position like so. So now from here I have to start working in other ways, which we're going to look at in a second. But if at any point I see her knee drift outside my hip, I can flatten her out. If at any point I see her elbow drift too far back, I can either go one with my elbow right to the inside. Usually if I see my partner's hand is lower than the line of her elbow here, I take my elbow right inside. And now as she goes to start working, I flatten her out. If I see the elbow is higher than the height of the hand and somewhere up here, now it might be hard for you to swim the elbow inside. You might end up off balance from here. Whenever I see this, we just take a hand inside and we go in here like so. Now we just go into that same backhand frame. She goes to work, we flatten the shoulder, we crash that far shoulder, and we go to work. Okay, so when we move to this over back grip, we're looking for one of two things initially. We want to put our partner's back flat on the floor. Many times as she goes to move away from me, if she's naive, she goes to extend away, she just almost flattens herself out. This will happen even with black belt world champions, this will happen a lot, ADCC champions, because they just are terrible when you close the distance. But assuming that my partner's good, you're looking to keep elbow position good, knee position good. If at any point I see the knee drift outside my hip, there's no reason why we can't put that back flat on the floor, we'll have to fight from here. Any reason, any time we see that elbow drift behind the ribcage, there's no reason why we can't flatten her out. If the hand, if you draw a line that goes straight out from the elbow, if the hand is below that line, we take the elbow right inside with an elbow slice. We slice to an inside bicep tuck. If the elbow is above the hand, we can't get the elbow inside, we swim underneath, we move to an inside bicep tuck. Now she has to start moving from here. We go in, we lock those hands, we open everything up, we fight to the inside position, and now we're ready to go in and start our passing game from top half guard to the top head and arm. This is just a very basic way of flattening my partner out once we get to the over back grip. If you see her swim and she just flattens out, just flatten your partner out. The two things we're looking at is knee position, elbow position. If the elbow position is spot on and you can't get right to the upper body inside position, chase the hips first. Flatten the hips out and then climb your way up to the upper body. If you feel like your partner has poor elbow position and the elbow comes back too far, then it's a pretty easy thing to just go right to the upper body, skip moving to the hips, and then right away as soon as you flatten them out, you're in a perfect position to control the head and the shoulders, and you can go to a top head and arm and start passing from there. All right, so many times when we go to hip switch, our partner will take the knee out and try to bridge us over because we are switching our hips, so our base is slightly compromised. What happens a lot of times is I use a combination of these hand fighting methods. You go in, I go to hip switch, and as I go to hip switch, my partner will take a hand up like so, and now she'll put her foot on the floor and try to give a big bridge out and over and take me up and over like so. Whenever I see this, the first thing I want to look to do is to keep my head over my partner's head. If she can bridge and look to get my head out and over... Go back. If she can look to get my head out and over here somewhere where now my head is not directly over hers, this is going to be a recipe for disaster and she's going to come on top of me. The first thing I'm looking to do, the second my partner goes to bridge, I want to immediately look to take my head and keep it right over my partner's head. The only way I can do this is by taking my left hand and basing out behind me. When she goes to bridge, she bridges into my base support like so. Now from here, when she starts coming back down, I take that hand at post hand and I convert it to a cross face. There's going to be a battle here if your partner is good, where you try to come down into a chest to chest position and your partner tries to take her foot back off the floor and insert a knee as a knee shield. Now she can make space, bring the hands back inside, and then separate. The second I feel my partner, the bridge is no longer in effect, she's no longer bridging into me, I immediately take my right knee and I chase my partner's far hip and I drop my right hip down. The second she goes to bring her knee back inside, we end up here. Then we simultaneously convert to a cross face and underhook. We move to that top head and arm and we go to work and start passing right from here. We go in, we start hip switching, and we play a game where as we go to hip switch, we play here. Now my partner can't use the underhook to off balance me from this position. She has to use an underhook from here, it's hard to get an off balance. You can go to bridge, it's harder for her to off balance me. Not impossible, we have other options that we can hit from there, but most of the time what's going to happen is you go to hip switch and your partner goes right in here, and they time the hip switch, they start off balancing you and coming up to top position. Whenever I see this, I want to stay head over head. If she can get her head under my chest, this is no good. I want to stay directly head over head. So the second she goes to start bridging, we post the hand behind us. Now she won't take us over. Now as she goes to come back down, if she's naive with the leg position, she just comes back down and I flatten my partner out. But against anybody good, there's always going to be this battle where she gives a quick bridge and then tries to use the bridge as a kazoo sheet to bring her knee back inside and make space. What it looks like is she goes to bridge, I post, she brings her knee back in, and from here she makes space and now separates my hands. So there's always going to be a battle for this knee. If she can get her knee inside my hip, she's going to recover. So I want to take my knee across to her far hip to point this top knee away from it. Do you guys recall the goals in our first passing instructional? Get the feet and the knees to point away from us. We're walking the knee to point out and away from us. So from here, I hip push through, she goes to bridge. Now the second she goes to bring that knee in, she can't. Now the cross face comes in, I'm ready to go in and start passing. This bridge makes sense for your partner. Whenever I train with guys in our own gym, no one uses explosive bridges to escape things. We all try to fight back to the inside position, so it's mostly guys bringing knees inside. But outside of our team, when you go and compete against most guys, you train with most people, I'm sure that you guys are dealing with people who have strong explosive bridges. This is always going to be a good option for them to go to. But you are switching your hips. If they can hit a quick bridge, you can get taken over pretty easy from here. My whole thing is, I put a post hand in the exact direction she's bridging. So we're here, as she goes to hit a quick bridge, now she goes to come back down and bring the knee back inside. She can't, now ready to go in and start passing from the top of the arm. So stopping a bridge, her partner goes to throw that arm up and put her foot on the floor. She not only takes her knee outside my hip, but uses it to bridge and try to take me over. So this time we're going to be down passing half guard, we're going to use this hip switching method. And this time, we hip switch with an elbow that's a little bit flared, and our partner actually gets to an underhook. Now understand, it's going to be harder for your partner to off balance you because she's working at the shorter end of the lever. She's working well below my shoulder line, even below my chest, trying to take that arm up with an underhook versus working up above my shoulder line at the neck trying to off balance me. So it's going to be harder for her to off balance us. But when we flatten our partner out, we won't have an underhook available to us. So it's a little bit different from here. So this time she goes to off balance us. The first thing we're going to look to do as she goes to start off balancing us is post this hand behind us and immediately put a V grip in our partner's arm like so. Our partner's armpit like so. This ensures that she won't start coming up and trying to shrug to my back. Because ultimately, if she has an underhook and she doesn't just try to come on top of me, if she just bridges and tries to get on top, then we're just fighting a battle for top position. But many people will try to bridge and then scoot down and away, and then expose my back and come out the back door. So the first thing I want to do is stop my partner from taking me over. That's the primary emphasis. If I move this over back grip, I don't want him to just bridge. And I'm on bottom position before you know it. So from here, the second she goes to bridge, I post the hand. Now I don't want her scooting down and away, so I put a V grip in place. Now from here, when she goes to start moving down and taking my back, she can't do it because of the V grip. And now the second she engages bridge, the second from here, she goes to bring her hips back down. We move through, we move back to the same cross face that we looked at before. And now we're passing chest to chest with the cross face, and my partner has an underhook. But once she goes to use the underhook, I just put my forehead on the floor, and it's no longer effective as an underhook. So we won't finish with the top hand arm, we'll finish with just the cross face, but it's pretty much the same. We just have to adjust a few simple things. So I go to hip switch, pass my partner's knee shield. From here we get this over back grip, she goes to bridge, we go right here. Now from this position, she goes to settle down, we go in, we flatten our partner out, and we're ready to go in and start working from this position here with a strong cross face in place. Conversely, if for whatever reason she has an underhook, and from here I go to cross face her, and from here she blocks the cross face. Now from here we just go in, we puddle through again, we just move right back to that over back grip, where now she won't have the momentum to bridge me over. I can start playing from here, where she has an underhook, she tucks the hand in, whatever the case is, and I start playing however I want to pass right from this position. It's the same thing where if I go to bridge, or I go to hip switch, and she goes to bridge, from here if I can't get to an underhook, whatever the case is, I try to go back into a cross face, I can't get to the cross face, from here I can go in, I can play with the underhook, I can switch my head, we'll look at this later, I can switch my head, there's a ton of different things we can do from here. Or if I can't get to the cross face, and I can't flatten her out for whatever reason, I can go right back to the reverse, to this over back grip, and I can play right from here. So there's many different options, we'll look at them as we go on, but there's many different combinations we can use here, off of this initial hip switch. So we get to the over back grip, and we'll look to shut down our partner's initial bridge. If she doesn't have an underhook, and she's working above my shoulder line, now she has pretty much only one attack. She can try to bridge me up and over, I have to post, and now I can go back and start flattening my partner out. Whereas if she has an underhook, she doesn't have as much potential to off balance me, but she can off balance me, and then try to scoot down and work to a tight waist, or work to my legs, or work to my back. So I post, I put a V grip in place. When she goes to start moving around from here, we go in, we flatten her out, and then we're ready to start working with a strong cross face in place. So very, very similar working with your partner bridging, but if she has an underhook, you have to use a little bit different hand position, a little bit different gripping series, and then we flatten our partner out, ending up with a cross face, and working from there. We're going to look at a situation where we're going to go over, we're going to end up in bottom position, we're using Kimura to take our partner back over to top position, and then pass with Kimura. So this time, we go into a hip switch, and the inevitable happens, this is going to happen sometimes, the bridge actually goes to take me over. There's two ways we can lock Kimura, let's look at both of them. One is I go to hip switch, and she's working above my shoulder line, like so. So now, she goes to bridge, I go to fall over, and we quickly take a grip with our left hand, where we just go in, elbow deep like so. From this position, we just turn our shoulders away from our partner, and the hand slips off the shoulder. She has to hold a tight grip now, I just turn away, and the hand will slip off, and we'll switch to our partner's wrist, and we'll go in and we'll lock Kimura, like so. In the event that my partner has an underhook, and she has to start bridging, from here I just go in, I go in elbow to elbow, and I just cut my partner's shoulder like so. As I fall, I turn away from my partner, like so, we go in elbow to elbow, we expose the wrist, and we lock Kimura. So two great ways to lock up Kimura. One, she's working above the shoulder line, I hip switch. From here, we go in, we go in elbow deep like so. So if I have to, I can pull the arm towards me, I bait her coming on top, I switch. From this position, as I'm falling down, I turn. So the second I feel my head's out of position, I'm going to fall over, I turn into this position, I expose my partner's wrist, and we lock Kimura. So what this will look like, is I go to hip switch, she goes to bridge, and we lock Kimura like so. Two, working from an underhook, her underhook, she goes to bridge, we expose the elbow, we go elbow to elbow, we expose the wrist, and we lock Kimura. So that's the upper body grips, actually locking Kimura. Now as she goes to come on top, and I actually lock Kimura, I'm going to take my outside leg, so my left leg in this case, right now she has my right leg trapped, I take my outside leg, and I insert it as a butterfly hook for Yoko Tsumigeshi. So as she goes to come on top, I lock Kimura, she gets on top, and we put in a butterfly hook like so. For now, I have a Yoko Tsumigeshi, a side Tsumigeshi. And now, when she gets to start getting to top position, we just lift with this Yoko Tsumigeshi hook. I post a foot on the floor, I turn towards my partner, and I lift diagonally over my left shoulder. Because she can't lock her hands from here, I can always put the Kimura behind her back. When she goes to base out, there's just no way, with a bridge and a lift, we take our partner over, we finish either in a T-Kimura, number one. Number two, if our partner turns into us, obviously we have attacks on our partner's back. Or number three, many times, you'll deal with someone who's very explosive. And as you go to take your partner over, what will happen is they'll use the momentum to quickly whip up to their knees and you'll lose the Kimura. So what will happen is, I go to hit Yoko Tsumigeshi, she'll use the momentum, she'll roll through. Now she'll quickly whip up to her knees and she'll use the momentum to pull out and limp arm free. What will happen is she'll end up in bottom position, you have the Kimura, you're going to take her over, she'll use that momentum to quickly whip up and then you lose the Kimura. So what you're trying to do is to end up in a T-Kimura past your partner's legs, right? So that once you land in a T-Kimura, you either take your partner's back or you can use the Kimura if they stay on their back to just come up and sizzle your legs. I put my forehead on the floor, I sizzle my legs, now in top position I'm past my partner's legs and past their guard. So you're looking, okay, I'm either going to get a back take or a guard pass out of this, right? But then you deal with someone who's super uber explosive, maybe they're sweaty, shirtless, maybe they're greased and they just start aggressively spinning away from you and you're losing the Kimura. This is a perfect time to backtrack into your partner's legs on your own terms. So from here, whenever I see this, I go to take my partner over at Ryoko Tsumigeshi and I take my opposite leg as I go to take my partner over, I catch my partner's leg like so. So once you go to explosively turn away from me, the leg is now hooked. And I use that to build back up to top position and now I'm in half guard, my partner flattened out and I have a Kimura locked and I'm chest to chest. So instead of taking your partner over into a T-Kimura and being so overzealous to get past your partner's legs, I backtrack into her legs. I physically trap myself back into a half guard, but on my own terms. Now I have a submission locked, I have a Kimura and I'm chest to chest. All right? So this is getting more advanced now with combination work. We're going to take our partner over or we're going to hip switch past our partner's legs. Maybe she has no shoulder post, whatever the case is, I go to hip switch past my partner's legs and either one, she has an under hook and goes to come on top like so, or two, she's working at the shoulder. She goes to come on top like so. And from here, as she goes to come on top, she enters the Yoko Subigation. So what I have now is a butterfly hook in, a knee outside my partner's hip and a post leg with Kimura. But she goes to start balancing herself from here by directionality of force. So I'm taking the hand behind the back as always, I'm lifting over my left shoulder, driving with my right foot. So when she goes to balance from here, I take my partner over. If she turns toward me, she gets her back taken. If she stays here, then I just plant my head on the floor. I scissor my legs, then I use Kimura to come up and I start going in and either passing my partner's guard, going into submission or what have you. The main danger associated with this, especially when you're working with grease, is that your partner will use the momentum of the shoulder roll to whip up and pull the arm free. They'll just limp the arm out and the Kimura will come off. So whenever I see this, I backtrack into my partner's legs. But from here, she goes to start rolling through. I use that to come up and now from here, I'm ready to start going in and passing my partner's guard from chest to chest, half guard with a Kimura loft. Whenever I see I'm dealing with someone who's uber explosive and we'll just use the momentum to spin up to their knees, I use a backtracking method where I try to hip switch, I get caught off guard and my partner bridges me over. I use the threat of a Kimura to put it behind the back, combined with Yoko Tsubagishi to take my partner back over to bottom position. And if, best case scenario, I get a pass, I get my partner's back. Worst case scenario, I feel like they're super, super explosive. I take the extra time to backtrack into the legs and move back into a half guard, but it's on my own terms. I'm chest to chest in half guard. I have a Kimura loft and I'm ready to start my passing. Okay, so now that we've established we can backtrack into our partner's half guard, but with Kimura, there's a multitude of different ways that we can go from here. We can stay with the Kimura, we can transition to the top head and arm, we can punch an underhook. There's tons of different things that we can do from here. Some good options are, if at any point we have Kimura locked, understand that at any point we can just go in, hug the Kimura to our chest and transition to an underhook. And then from the underhook, we can start pulling our partner in, take our hand across and transfer, switch it to a top head and arm, and we can go in and start playing a positional game. So understand that these are available at all times. A couple of other great passes we have with Kimura here is we can keep Kimura locked and from here we can start driving our head down to the floor and posting our head on the floor like so. We can take our shin across our partner's hips like so, and we can use this to start shearing our leg free. I want you guys to keep my knee trapped. It's a pretty easy thing from here to take my leg out and now from here I have a choice of either falling to T-Kimura and working from here, or usually if I want to chase my partner's back or other various missions, Yoko Sentaku, things like that, or as my leg comes out, my partner goes to take my back and move me around from here. It's not easy. I'm hooked into my partner's hip with a butterfly hook here. I just take my legs across into side control and I'm ready to go in and start finishing with Kimura or transitioning to upper body pins right from here. Okay, so with the Kimura locked, I have a couple of great choices. We can of course always transition to upper body positional pins and work from there. Another great choice from here is I just post my head on the floor. As I post my head on the floor, we take our shin up and across. My partner goes to move me around from here. It's not going to be easy. She can put a butterfly hook in her head. It's a pretty easy thing to pass from here. We just palm the legs free. If at any point my partner does make a transition to a butterfly hook, I just have to out-pommel my partner from here. Her hips are pinned. When she goes to move me around, I can top pommel. I can front pommel. There's so many different ways that we can go from here. When she gets exposed to my back and do all the things she wants to, it's a pretty easy thing to make a passing transition from here and go in. We'll look at more of the leg pommels later. Passing from this Kimura with locked hands. We can go in and we can play a game where we either go in and use a shearing method with the shin across my partner's hips to pass. We can also make a transition to a single-handed Kimura where I take the meat of my partner's hand and I grab. I don't grab the wrist. She can extend her hand free and she's gone. Whenever I see this, I slide down to the meat of my partner's hand and I physically put a bend in her wrist and I catch over my partner's knuckle line. Now when she goes to start moving her hand away from here, it's difficult. The closer my partner's hand is to her shoulder line, the tighter the lock is going to be. When she goes to move that hand now, it's not going anywhere. Now I have another series of great choices from here. Probably the easiest is to use either a post hand or an elbow and side. If I use a post hand, I don't make the mistake of having a flared elbow. Someone's long arms can reach through and take a one-on-one on my hand here and start to give me problems and even bridge me over. I always make sure if I'm going to post on a knee, I post with a closed elbow. And now from here, I walk, walk, walk, and I slide my knee through. Or I use an elbow. It's a little bit safer. From here, I walk my partner's knees pointing away from me. When she goes to stop me from bringing the knee free, I just walk, walk, walk. I keep my hips turned from here. What I don't want is that square hips. From here, she goes to bring the knee inside. She posts my hip maybe with her hand. She brings the knee inside to a full butterfly guard, or she brings a butterfly hook in place. And now from here, the knee comes in. And now my elbow's across the center line and she exposes me. So I always make sure that my hips are slightly turned from here. I'm not completely on my hip because now I can get bridged over in this direction. And I'm not completely square so her knee can come in. I'm just slightly off my hips here. Whether I have the Kimura or whether I have a single hand like so. I play from this position. And now I walk, walk, walk. Knee comes across. I'm in three-quarter mount. Now from here, we have a multitude of options. We can switch back to Kimura. We can use that shearing method that we just did. We can lift the elbow. We can punch an underhook in. Now we can pass from three-quarter mount. We'll look at that a little bit later. But you can slide to three-quarter mount. You have a multitude of options where you can easily pass from here once you get the knee to the floor. And if you don't feel comfortable dominating your partner's hip with your shin, we just use a single hand. But now from here, it's the easiest thing because it's free to knee. Bring the knee down to the floor like so. Okay? Another great option is from here, we go in, we scoop our partner's leg with a scoop grip. And now once again, we dominate our partner's hip line with our shin. And now wherever she goes to move from here, she goes to bridge, has no effect. We just go in, we backstep through, and now we're out once again. Now we can easily make a pass. We can switch back to Kimura, go to pass, fall to T-Kimura. There's a variety of options from here. Okay? Main thing is, using that backtracking method, also Yoko Sumigeshi, or however you're going to lock a Kimura, to go in, and we start in a position like so. And she has to bring that bottom knee in, it's not going to happen. And she has to start bridging me around, moving me around, it's not going to happen. Down here, she brings that bottom knee in, now it's trouble for me. So I start in this position here. She has to move me around, it's not going to happen. And she has to start recovering. She has to start recovering. It's not an easy thing with this Kimura. Okay, so we use the threat of Kimura, take our partner over, and we start passing from there. We can pass to side control, we can pass to north-south, we can pass to transition to T-Kimura, we can take our partner's back. There's so many different options we have from there. And it all starts with the initial Kimura grip. So you have a great choice of keeping your hands locked with Kimura, or switching to a single hand so you have a free hand to work with, pushing your partner's knee down, and then ultimately freeing your knee to start your passing game. All right, so this time, we're going to be moving from our hip switch, and we use the Kimura for our partner back on bottom, and then pass from there. Now let's say this time, there's always going to be a time when your partner goes to bridge on top of you, and Kimura's just not there. You're a day late, a dollar short, and you try to lock your hand, then just, you can't get a Kimura grip lock. All right, most times this is going to happen when your partner does an exceptional job of taking his hand up nice and high, and from this position, as your partner goes to bridge, you're going to switch to Kimura, but they latch on hard onto your fore trap with this hand. So I try to make separation, and as they go to come on top, there's just not enough time to go in and lock up with Kimura. Or if your partner has an underhook, they take a strong tight waist, where as they go to bridge, you feel like it's there, and you just can't expose the wrist and get to an underhook. Okay, so we're going to look at both of these scenarios right now. The first situation we're going to look at is where my partner has a grip high above my shoulder line, and she's looking to start bridging me up and over. She goes to, I go to hip switch, she goes to take me over, I try to post, I feel like it's not going to be there, and from here, for whatever reason, I feel like I'm going to go over. So this time, instead of switching to Yoko Tsubagishi, I just stay with a normal butterfly guard. As my partner goes to take me over, I go to fall, fall, fall, and I just insert my right leg this time as a butterfly hook. Now when she goes to come up, from this position, we just come in, and we go in and we lock the gi team like so. From here, once I have a gi team, for any Tsubagishi that I'm looking to go into, my partner, I'm looking to get my partner's forehead to the floor. If you look at any Tsubagishi, with the exception of shoulder crunch and a few others, the few where I have a shoulder crunch, for example, I don't have to put my partner's forehead on the floor, but with most Tsubagishis from here, getting the forehead to the floor is what's going to take your partner over. So you end up in this gi team position, where her hand is up and over my head, and we have the gi team in place. From here, we're just going to take a lifting action with our right leg. We're going to shoot our left leg through, and we're just going to use inverted toes of our left leg to just take our partner up and over to bottom position like so. So we're going to start with this hip switching motion. We go to hip switch. From here, she bridges me over. I turn a lot more, so it's just not there. She goes to get on top, and we end up with a gi team like so. Because I have a gi team, I can put her forehead on the floor. Once that forehead's on the floor, I start a lifting motion. If her head is on my left side, I start lifting with my right leg. And now from here, she's basing, basing, basing, what takes her over is this additional push with my left leg, where I invert my toes, and from here, we take my partner up into bottom position. If she stays in this position, from here, it's the easiest thing in the world to plant my head, scissor my legs, and end up in top position, where now I have a gi team. I can work. I can punch an underhook. I can switch to positional pins. I can step over into mount. We can finish gi teams and do whatever we want from there, either with submissions or just positional advances. The big danger, again, of course, is from here, if I go to roll my partner through, she uses the momentum to roll all the way through. I lose the head. She rolls up. I try to get up. We end up in a kind of a scramble where maybe I'm in top position, maybe I'm bottom, and it kind of degenerates from there. So in the event that I see this, we go in, we start lifting, lifting, lifting, and then right at the last second, we hook our partner's leg. So once you use that momentum to roll through, we come up with an underhook like so, and from here, we transition from that gi team to a crossface, and now we're ready to go in and start passing from the top head and arm. We can backtrack into our partner's legs to ensure that we stay with the front head and the gi team, and we can start putting our partner back to bottom position, backtracking into half guard and keeping top position. So from here, she ends up on top. We go gi team. The main danger is that when I go to start lifting, my partner just uses that to end up belly up. Now I try to get on top, and she manages to roll through. She clears my hands, whatever the case is, and I lose my partner. So from here, this time I go to lift. As I go to lift, she tries to aggressively roll through. As from here, we're ready to go in and start passing from a top head and arm. So we use that gi team to take my partner back over into bottom position and start working with the crossface and underhook to start passing. Now a little bit different, almost the same, a little bit different. My partner goes to start bridging me over, and this time she has an underhook. This time instead of going into a regular gi team, we go into an arm and gi team. She goes to come up on top. As she does so, from here, we go in, we take an arm and gi team. And now from here, same thing. I have my partner's forehead on the floor. So when she goes to base out, she can only base so much. She can base, base, base. And now if my hips leave the floor, and obviously if you look at seated guard, my seated guard instructional, I have the full mechanics of the sumige, she's not going to go into crazy detail here, but once my hips leave the floor from here, she goes up and over. I catch my partner's leg, and she has to start rolling out, moving around, she's hooked in place. Now from here, we just go in, we flatten our partner out. This time we switch to a V grip with our right hand. So when I go to transition to the crossface, she goes to use her underhook. The underhook is no longer effective. I can use the crossface to go in, flatten her out, and start our passing right from a crossface in top position. Those are two great choices. Moving from a hip switch, our partner does manage to bridge us over. This time instead of using kimura, we can't lock kimura, so we lock into a gitein. Either with a low elbow gitein, high elbow gitein you can make a transition to, or an arming gitein, where we either end up in top half guard with our partner flattened out with a top-headed arm, or with a strong crossface in place, ready to go in and start using our freehand to work. Alright, so this time we go into a gitein, and for whatever reason the gitein is failing, we're going to switch to a shoulder crunch sumigeshi. Now this isn't the exact sequence that happened, but it's a very similar sequence to what happened in my joao roshun match, where I had control over his head and shoulders, I had a top-headed arm, he bridged me over, I switched to a pinch headlock from a top-headed arm, I switched to a shoulder crunch, and I put him back into bottom position, back into bottom half guard. So similar, but not exactly the same, I didn't use it off the gitein, I used it off a top-headed arm, but you can see a very clear example, and a very similar example to this, if you study my match, the one time he did sweep me from a top half, the first time he swept me from top half guard, I used a shoulder crunch to put him back to bottom position. So whenever I see, I go to hip switch, in my joao roshun match I was here, like so, and I made a mistake of going into a butterfly hook before I went to a high tripod, and he bridged me over, and as he went to go bridge me over, I got my second butterfly hook back in, I switched from a pinch headlock to a shoulder crunch, and I returned him to half guard out in this direction. So we're going to look at a similar idea here, where this time, my partner goes to bridge, this time she has her hand up high, I go to hip switch, she goes to bridge, and for whatever reason I feel like the gitein's failing, where the head pops out. The second the head pops out, we go in, we lock our shoulder crunch, and the second the head pops out, she's trying to recenter it. I use that momentum as she goes to push towards me to take my partner over, and use a shoulder crunch to take her over to the opposite side. And of course I'm not going to go over the mechanics of the shoulder crunch, because I went over it in detail with the CD guard instructional, so reference that for mechanics of the shoulder crunch. So this time she's working above the shoulder line, I go to hip switch, she goes to bridge, I go to gitein, the gitein fails, the head pops out, the shoulder crunch prevails, and I take her up and over with a nice sumigishi with a shoulder crunch. This time we go in, and she goes into an underhook. Now I don't have access to the shoulder crunch, so what do I do now? This time I go in, I go in, she goes to take me up and over, and I go into the arm and gitein like so. This time I go into the arm and gitein, I have to make a switch, where from here, normally what I do is I 1. Pummel underneath, which is pretty easy, or 2. If I feel like I can't pummel underneath, I off balance my partner out to the side like I'm going to take her over, and now I take a high elbow grip. I take my hand up high, I threaten the high elbow gitein. Her only defense from here to defend the high elbow is either to roll to bottom position and end up back where she came from, or 2. To reach over my shoulder and pull my elbow down. And now as she does that, the head slips out, she has to reach down at the head, and we use that shoulder crunch to take my partner back up and over, and we get a nice shoulder crunch to top position. So whenever I see my partner's working with an underhook, from here I go to hip switch, she goes to bridge, we go from an arm and gitein to a high elbow gitein. If we can't dig underneath, we switch to a high elbow by taking my partner out and over to my left hip. This will give me space to slide my hand underneath and switch to a high elbow. Now I'm strangling, strangling, she pulls the hand down, from here she has to push back into me, I switch to that shoulder crunch, and as the head comes out, we lift our partner over in the opposite direction, and we get to top position for the win. In case we take our partner over, and we end up either, most of the time, a lot of times we're past our partner's guard, or at the very least we're in some kind of half guard, come on up, so we're in some kind of half guard from here, where we take our partner over, and now from here we have a near side underhook, and we can go in, start passing the near side, several underhooks, and start working from there, and we'll look to pass from there later. So either we end up in some kind of half guard, chest to chest, or a lot of times we end up in side control or mount, and we can pass our partner right off of the sweep. So great counters now, where I go to hip switch, she bridges me over, I go to a guillotine, I take my partner back over. Or I go to Kimura, I take my partner back over. Next time maybe, the Kimura fails, she's in good hand position, I switch to a guillotine, I take her back over. Maybe the guillotine fails, the head pops out, I switch to a shoulder crunch, I take her back over in the opposite direction. So this is a great way of how the submission systems, and how the positional systems, chain together, and in order to be a true master at half guard passing, you have to be able to concede top position for a small amount of time, and have confidence that even if you lost, maybe you did a hip switch, you lost position, they got on top of you for a half a second, knowing that you can switch to your bottom position game, you can switch to your seated guard series, and take your partner over with a shoulder crunch, and end up right back on top in half guard. So this is how the one, this is a great example of how one system, the strength of one system will cover the weaknesses of other systems. We have the half guard system, we have guillotine system, we have the Kimura system, and we have the seated guard system, all in one kind of counter to a counter to a counter to a counter. And it eventually leads us back into a top half guard, where we want to be, chest to chest, ready to pass. Alright, so now we've looked at situation, this over back grip will lead you into a lot of options. And here we go, here we go, first one right? You clearly don't even know what you are saying. No, no go ahead. This ankle scoop, this over back grip will lead you into a lot of options. And using this ankle scoop is a great way to create a situation where you can get your hip inside your partner's knee. So when we're, I know he's dying, you guys together, we're leaving this all in here by the way, you're going to have to watch it. We're going to have to use it, we've been in this over back series for I don't know an hour or so, more now. So I'm sure you guys are bored, I'm sure this is a good way to break it up. So as I talked about before, when we go to this over back grip, we're trying to get our partner flattened out. Now if we can post on our partner's knee or Z grip our partner's ankle, it's a pretty easy thing to start walking the hips flat. If your partner willingly takes the leg out, the knee out and starts bridging, now we look at a way to deal with that. If your partner willingly takes the knee out and she's an idiot, then there's no reason why I can't just flatten her out. But there's always going to be a time where your partner has either a grip like so or a grip like so and you can't get this knee outside. Like okay, what do I do now? And she has a good knee elbow connection maybe, I feel like I'm trying to walk her flat, but when I go to walk her flat, I just, I can't beat this knee, I can't push it down, I can't do any of that stuff. Whenever I see this, this is a perfect time to move into the ankle scoop series. And what is the ankle scoop series? I'm going to start moving down towards my partner's ankle. I'm going to physically scoop my partner's ankle with my arm, elbow deep right in the ankle and I'm going to grab my partner's tailbone like so. With a Gi, this is an extremely, extremely robust grip because you can actually grab your partner's pants. Working with a Gi, this is way, way stronger, but it's still amazingly strong without the Gi as well. Because of the fact that my partner's heel and butt are connected, when she goes to actually move her leg around from here, it's a very difficult thing. And it's a pretty easy thing for me from here to start pummeling. If my partner goes to move that leg around, it's not going to be easy and I can start moving into situations where I can beat that knee. I'm trying to beat this knee with my hip. So we're going to move into an ankle scoop series now where I go into this over back grip, I hip switch, we're playing a game in case you guys forgot what we're doing. She has no upper body posting grips. She has a high knee shield. We go in, we're playing a game. And from here, we're trying to beat the knee and we go in and we hip switch over and we beat my partner with this over back grip and get control over the head and shoulders. Now she has that knee inside and I feel like I can't beat the knee. Whenever I see this, we just go through, we scoop our partner's ankle, elbow deep, and we just connect our palm and fingers to our partner's tailbone here. Now from here, I flare my elbow and I start leaning towards my partner's hip. And now when she goes to move that leg around, it's not an easy thing from here. So I move from a situation where my hips are completely turned and my left hip is almost on the floor to a situation where I'm flaring my elbow and coming back up square now. But now when she goes to move around from here, it's not easy. When she goes to move her head away from me, it's not easy. And now from here, we can start our pummeling game and start working with this ankle scoop and going into all of our passes from there. So working with an ankle scoop off of the initial over back grip. All right, so now we're going to look at this ankle scoop. And this ankle scoop is something that you're not going to get all the time. But understand the threat of using the ankle scoop is what's going to allow you to flatten your partner out from this position. And we're going to talk about this in a little while. So once we get to this ankle scoop off of this initial hip switch, where we control our partner's head and shoulders, and we get to this ankle scoop, we end up here. My partner tries to keep the knee in now, all right? When she goes to keep the knee in from this position, I try to push the ankle down, I try to push the knee out. It's hard to do. But when I get to this ankle scooping position here, and she goes to keep that knee in, it's a pretty easy thing from here to start leaning towards my partner's hips and opening up my elbow like so. When she goes to keep that knee in, go ahead, pull the knee up, it's a pretty easy thing to start walking, walking, walking, and I just flare my elbow. Elbow, knee comes right out. And now from here, we can go in and start working to get to our positions where we can flatten our partner out. Once we're in this position, I start walking my partner flat down to the floor. And now from here, we have a choice of either staying with this ankle scoop, which is what we're going to look at in a second, or if you don't like this grip, my partner clears this grip, whatever the case is, we just come in and now we just look to start going in and pummeling our underhook in place, switching to a cross face. And now we can come in and start moving the top head and arm and passing with various upper body grips, okay? So this ankle scoop is a great way to start flattening our partner out, provided she has the inside position with the knee and she's keeping her knee inside. I just go in and I just start walking. I start shuffling my feet towards my partner's legs. One, two, or my right foot goes first, one, left foot follows, two, one, two, one, two. Now she has to keep that knee in and just open the elbow and it comes right out. So she goes to keep that knee inside and flatten our partner out. And now from here, we go in, we start playing a game where we either pummel underhook in or from here, we can start going in and sliding across a three quarter mount. My partner has a post to my knee and I can pummel underhook in. It's a variety of different things that we can do from here, which we'll work on later. All right, now just focusing on the ankle scoop, getting our partner flattened out in a half guard and going from there.
