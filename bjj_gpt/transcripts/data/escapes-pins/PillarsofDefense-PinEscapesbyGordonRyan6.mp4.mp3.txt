 Now we're actually in mount, we're going to go into some escapes from here. And like I said, the game is always going to be the same. It's always about fighting back to inside position. In this case is going to be our elbows versus our partner's knees. We're first going to start when someone is postured up over top of us and their shoulders are directly over their hips. So the first thing we're going to look at is we're bottom mount. Then we're going to basic, the elbow escapes when our partner has no upper body control and she has shoulders over hips, how we can escape from here. Then we're going to look at our partner comes down heavy, she puts in a cross face, she drops her hips, she uses a variety of different leg positions and she starts crushing me from here, how can I escape from here. Then my partner elevates one arm over my head, how we can escape from here. Then my partner elevates two arms over my head, how we can escape from here. And then my partner manages to take an arm across my body, lock a figure four backhanded arm or a backhanded arm, how we can quickly strip this grip before we get our back taken and recover from here. And then we'll go through, we'll go into detail at each one of these positions. And then of course, we're going to look at a quick way to stop my partner from dismounting from mount back into side control. And as they go to dismount, entering into their legs and going into Ashi Garami. So now let's talk about our opponent's leg positions. We talked about this in attacking from top pins mount, and it's relevant here when we're talking about escaping bottom mount. Our partner can have a few different leg positions. From top position, I can have my feet together or relatively close together with a touching like so. I can have my feet crossed underneath my partner's butt, like so. I can have grapevines on my partner's legs where I strike my partner's legs out, like so. I can have a situation where my partner goes to bridge to one side. Actually, I kicked both before. And I go into a long hook scenario, like so, where I put a wedge behind my partner's back. And we can go into a situation where my partner goes to bridge to one side, and we snap one knee up, like so. We put a wedge in our partner's hip, like so. Or she goes to bridge right side, and long hook comes in, like so. We have to be able to address all these foot positions and pummel out of all these foot positions, escape all these different foot positions as my partner presents them. So we're going to cycle through different foot positions, different hand positions, different hip heights, and a bunch of different variables, and look to go into escapes from all these different positions. All right, let's talk about bridging and shrimping from bottom mountain position. We're looking to escape against a talented opponent. When you see most people teach bridging and shrimping, they teach something along the lines of this, where you bridge to one side, you get a strong bridge, and then from here, you slide your hips out along the mat, like so. And you see the drills where you're basically doing warmups, you bridge and you shrimp down the mat, and you do things like this, where I bridge, and I shrimp. I bridge, and I shrimp. I bridge, and I shrimp, and I go down and along the mat. This is great when you're looking to hit some forms of escape, and it's great against people who are relatively low level, especially when escaping from mount. The problem is, when you start to do these kinds of shrimps against someone who's talented in a mountain position, what you find is that you can never separate the space, you can never exploit space between your partner's knees. So you bridge like so, and now you shrimp, and as you go to shrimp, you just drag your partner's hips along with you, and you try to get a knee inside, and it's just never going to happen from here. So one way that we can drastically increase the effectiveness of our bridging and shrimping is by doing it in a way which supports our partner's body weight. So we're going to look at a bridge where we take our feet in towards our butt like so. And when John showed me this, I was a brown belt, and it completely blew my mind. I was like, I didn't know how to shrimp the proper way until I've been training for five years almost, and I haven't been taught to bridge and shrimp the right way for mount. What's going on? But when you have it explained to you, it makes a lot of sense. I want to carry body weight with this bridge and shrimp. So when I bridge, I take my two feet into my butt, and now I start to bridge over a given shoulder, and my feet don't move. They stay in the same position they're in. I just invert my toes down towards the floor. So I bridge over a shoulder like so, and now from here, I turn my toes down towards the floor, and I just tuck my elbow deep behind me like so. So now if you're doing this, you can do it with a partner. Your partner should be able to come behind you and to sit on your hips, and you should physically be able to carry your partner's body weight on your hips like so. That's what you're looking for. So I bridge, and as I bridge, I shrimp, and I can carry my partner's body weight long enough to create space between their knees. So what you start getting from here when you apply this in a real life situation is I have to create space between my partner's knees. If I bridge and try to shrimp along the mat, you get this. But when I bridge and I can carry body weight, now when she goes to continue to mount me, I create space between my partner's knees, and I can easily bring knees back inside and start to recover. So we're going to be looking at a couple different kinds of bridging and shrimping today per situation depending on what my partner's doing. But understand there's different kinds of bridging and shrimping. There's one where you go along the mat, and there's one where your hips come up off the floor, and you have to be able to support your partner's body weight through the shrimp long enough to exploit the space between their knees. All right, so just a very basic knee elbow escape when our partner's either postured up over us or they have hands on the floor and just looking to go into basic elbow escape right back into half guard. All right, so we've all seen this. I'm just going to add a couple of small details you may or may have not seen before. So our whole thing is to get our elbows inside of our partner's knees like so. In order to do any high percentage escape, you have to win the battle for inside position, your elbows versus your partner's knees, okay, at some point. So when we look to go into knee elbow escapes, I'm going to look to take a hand to my partner's hip like so, an elbow inside my partner's knee, and a post on my own hand like so. So I can dominate my partner's knee on this side. I can dominate my partner's hip line through the cross hip post. Now I'm going to look to start bridging out and over to one side like so. I'm just going to straighten my right leg. As I straighten my right leg, I'm going to look to start pushing my partner's knee out and down so I can start hooking it with my left leg, okay. I'm going to look to start feeding my partner's ankle to my ankle, and from here I'm going to look to start catching my partner's ankle between my legs. If I see that my partner's foot is flat on the floor, it's flush to the ground like so, I catch in a very specific way. I don't, all the way flush, I don't just hook randomly and try to pull my partner's leg in, you'll always get slippage. I put my heel right below the little ball that sticks out of your partner's ankle here, and I turn my knee down towards the floor. And now you hook into your partner's foot and you just kick and you wedge yourself in place. And now from here, as I go to extend my left foot, I pull my heel to my butt. So I play a game where I extend my leg down my partner's foot until I feel I'm latched in. And now from here I scissor my legs by pulling my left heel to my butt and by pulling my right knee up to my chest. And now from here I keep my legs unlocked. What I want to do is I want to make my partner's left leg weightless, the left knee weightless. If I keep weight over my partner's, or if I keep my legs locked, my partner will always be able to put weight down onto her knee and make it hard for me to shove the knee down. So from here I unlock my legs and I scissor my legs. So I push my left leg away from me and I pull my right knee in like so. So once you get to put weight down on that knee, it's a difficult thing. And now it's the easiest thing to wedge my partner's knee in place. I'm not trying to push my partner's knee down. I'm trying to wedge it in place so I can make space to pull my right knee up. And now from here we just whip our legs across the opposite side. We start moving into a half guard transition where you can go back into a Tats. So my partner has a mounted position, whether she has shoulders over hips or whether she has hands on the floor. I've got my partner's hands on the floor. We get an inside elbow position. We get a cross frame and we're in position like so. I start bridging nice straight in my leg to start exposing my partner's foot. What I don't want is my partner's foot inside and underneath my leg because now I can't trap it with my ankle. So we just go in position like so and now we start exposing my partner's foot to our ankle. From here my partner's foot is flush on the floor. So I close my knee down and this exposes my partner's foot to being trapped between our two legs. Now she puts weight over the knee. So from here I scissor the legs, I extend my left leg away, I pull my right knee towards my chest. When she gets to put weight over that knee, it's the easiest thing in the world to wedge my partner's knee in place as my right knee just shoots up to my right elbow. And now from here we extend out and away, we move into a half guard scenario where we can start going in and attacking our partner with counter offense. Just a very basic knee elbow escape using the inside elbow position to trap our partner's ankle and moving back to a half guard. I'm sure we've all seen that. I just wanted to throw it in there for any of you who may be beginners who haven't seen it before. All right, so now let's look at basic elbow escape, let's look at an inside elbow escape. All right, where I take my knees to the inside instead of trapping my partner in half guard, we bring the knees back inside and recover to some kind of inside position guard with butterfly guard or ashi garami, things like that. So this time my partner is going to be on top of me, whether it be with her hands on the floor, usually your hands are going to be on the floor from here. And from here I'm going to come in and take my elbow to the inside position. This time I'm going to start bridging in a way that elevates my partner's hips where I can support body weight on her. If I try to hit an inside elbow escape, I need to make space for my knees to penetrate inside my partner's knees and hips. If I try to drag my hips along the floor, you're never going to make that space. So my whole thing is I want to make space by bridging and rotating like so to bring my partner's hips off the floor. Because of this cross hip post, there's no back exposure. I want tension running through my left arm across my partner's hips. There's no tension. She just takes her right hand and shoves my elbow by and now my back's exposed. So instead I want to always have forward tension towards my partner's hips. When she goes to throw the elbow by, it's difficult. Now from here I have my partner's weight supported by my hips. I wedge my partner's knee in place with my right elbow and from here I just start a walking action. One, two, three, four, five. And I make space for my knees to start coming in. From this position I take my bottom knee and I line it up with my partner's center line. As my knee fires through, I just take it to my partner's hip. Now when she goes to come forward and crush me, I have a wedge between myself and my partner and we can fire into a Rimi Ashi Garami. So when you go for an inside elbow escape, she has me flattened out and bottom mount. We take inside elbow position and cross hip post. From here we start to bridge into a situation where I can support our partner's body weight. When she gets to put her hips back down, I can support all of her weight. And now I just start a motion where I go to walk. She goes to bring her knees together, we just move out of the way. Now my knee comes right to the middle, to the hip, and we can put ourself into a Rimi Ashi Garami. One more time with a different angle. She has hands on the floor, we steal the inside position. From here she has feet just close together, hands on the floor, no cross face, no nothing. Now you have a strong bridge and we move into a Rimi Ashi Garami, ready to go into all of our favorite attacks. So now we're getting a little bit more combat realistic when you have someone who is coming down trying to crush you into under hooks, or trying to crush you underneath them, puts in a cross face, looking to put in grapevines, looking to put in under hooks. How we can clear grapevines and how we can prevent the initial under hook from coming in. So first of all, we're going to be playing this Pommeling game here. My partner is postured up like so, we have hands inside, my partner is looking to take cross wrist grips and looking to pin hands down. I'm always looking to play a Pommeling game where as she goes to take a cross wrist grip, I'm stripping a grip and then immediately off balancing my partner to one side, taking her hands to the floor, and then to start to try to go into knee elbow escapes, forcing her to put a cross face in, try to punch with under hooks, and bring my hands up and over my head. So there's always going to be this battle of my partner trying to put in cross wrist grips if she's smart, and coming through, me stripping the grip, and then off balancing in one given direction or another, forcing the hands to the floor, creating a Kazushi, and then going into knee elbow escapes, or kipping escapes, depending on what my partner does. But let's assume for now that my partner comes down heavy and she puts in a strong cross face and she starts grapevining. So this is a common response, it's not the best response because you can easily kip out from here, but it is probably the most common response you see from people, so you have to be able to deal with this. So let's first initially address the grapevines. She's going to lock grapevines in and extend my leg out like so. From this position, it's a pretty easy thing to start clearing these grapevines. I just extend one leg aggressively like so, and I put it on the floor. From here, I extend my second leg aggressively, and I put it on the floor, and I just keep my two legs flat. When she goes to re-grapevine, it's difficult. The problem is that people try to like half-ass extend their legs and they move their legs around and you never can clear. Just go one leg at a time, aggressively extend, she goes to keep a strong grapevine, I extend, and now my legs are on the floor until I decide what I'm going to do from here. Now as far as addressing an underhook, I don't want my underhook coming in, so a couple of ways that we can address this. Number one is by every time my partner goes to punch an underhook in, I just bridge over that side shoulder and I force her hand back to the floor. So when she goes to bridge, I just bump the hand to the floor. Now this is a game that you can play, but it's exhausting because you've got to bump your partner every couple of seconds as she's trying to pummel the underhook in. Another game that we can play is we can take an elbow inside like so, inside of our partner's knee, and we can start posting it on our partner's hip with either a hip post like so, or you can reinforce it with a cross hip post, and now it's not impossible, but it's more difficult for your partner to punch an underhook in. But she can still eventually blade the arm through, punch an underhook in, and start to elevate your arm up like so. So the best of all is if my partner has a cross face and tries to punch an underhook in, I just take a far side cross hip post like so, and now when she goes to punch an underhook in, it's not going to be impossible, but it's going to be incredibly difficult. And any kind of motion out and away will put your partner's hand back on the floor, and you don't have to give big bridges out and over to the side. So a couple of ways to both simultaneously clear grapevines if she has them, and prevent your partner from putting an underhooks either by bridging. Obviously if she goes to punch an underhook in, I can re-pummel to the inside, okay this is very super basic. Your partner can punch her hand to the inside, and I can punch my hand to the inside, so when she goes to pummel to underhook, when we play a pummeling game where she goes inside, I go inside, and then etc. etc. But the best of all is when you take either an elbow inside your partner's knee, like so, and have a strong knee or elbow to rib connection, or you take a cross hip post like so. This is the best of all. So now when your partner goes to punch an underhook, it's a very difficult thing to do, and you can start to go into all of your bridging, kipping, and tripping escapes. Now we're going to look at a way to separate my partner's feet when they're crossed underneath my butt. There's a specific way that we're going to pummel our legs in order to do this. So this time instead of having grapevine, she can have cross feet and a cross face. Whenever I see my partner has cross feet underneath my butt like so, I'm going to move my legs around and I'm going to see how my partner's feet are crossed. Whatever foot is on top, right now I can feel that my partner's left leg is on top. So I'm going to meet my partner's left leg with my right ankle, like so. And from here I just take my right ankle inside my partner's left ankle, and I step physically on my own foot. And from here I just push my partner's feet out and away. Now if I move my feet in any way, she can just relock her legs. My whole thing is I get a grip on my partner's ankle like so, I separate my partner's feet, and now with my ankle inside of hers, I extend my leg straight and I put my leg flat on the floor like so. And now when she goes to re-cross her feet underneath my butt, she can't do so. And now we can start our knee-elbow escape game from here. So this is going to be, the reason why I'm showing you this is if you're intending on knee-elbow escaping from this position, it's a lot easier to kick from this position, but you can knee-elbow escape as well. So when I see we're in a position where my partner has feet crossed, I just fiddle around with my feet until I feel which of her feet are on top. Right now it's her left foot, so my right ankle goes inside. If you switch, I move around my feet and my left ankle will go inside like so. And now I just step on my own foot. From here I separate my partner's feet, and then with my foot on the inside position, I just straighten my leg like so. Now if my toes point up towards the ceiling, my partner can sometimes take her heel underneath my kneecap and slide the feet through, and now she can reconnect her feet. So the second I straighten my leg, I just shrimp out ever so slightly so that I'm more on my left hip, and I put my toes pointing towards my partner's outside leg. When she goes to take her foot back underneath my leg, there's no space now. So I go from a position where I'm here, she goes to put her foot underneath, and it goes underneath. To a position where now I'm pointing in the direction I'm looking to escape, and when she goes to start probably back underneath, she can't and I can start my escape. Same is true with the grapevine. She has a strong grapevine in place. From this position, I immediately extend one, extend two, and then I'm looking to go into whatever side I'm looking to escape to. I just shrimp slightly towards that side. So when she goes to reconnect her legs, the only way she can go is between my legs, and she doesn't want to do that because now I can knee-elbow escape. So I play a game where I keep my legs inside hers, and now from here we can go into all of our eventual knee-elbow escapes and back into our attacks. So now we're going to look at going into knee-elbow escapes when we initially clear the grapevines or we separate our partner's cross feet and we have that inside leg position. We can theoretically elbow escape to either side, but it's always easiest to escape from the side you're looking to. If you have a strong cross face in, if she's cross-facing me and she's forcing me to look to my right, it's always easier to escape to that side instead of trying to go to the opposite side. But you can go to both sides. So if she's mounted me, and she's a right-hand cross-face, and she's forcing me to look out and over to my right side, I can go into a knee-elbow escape on both sides. We'll look at how so now. First thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to take my hand across my partner's hips. Right now, if we just try to shove it through, it's going to be difficult. So I just give a couple of quick bumps, one, two, three, four, to get my hand through like so. Now I take a hand inside my partner's hip, and I take my knee, my elbow inside my partner's knee, and I reinforce the grip like so. Now she has either cross feet, grapevines, whatever the case is. I go in, I straighten the leg, I straighten the leg, and I put a leg flat on the floor, and I start to angle. From this position, I just keep on angling through until I can expose my partner's ankle. When she goes to drive her knee up higher and higher and higher towards my shoulders to stop me from exposing the ankle, it's going to be a difficult thing. If she goes so wide and so high that I can't expose the ankle, now there's nothing stopping me from going right into an inside elbow escape. So what she has to do is she has to, one, she's in a dilemma game. She has to either, one, loosen the knees and bring the foot so high where it's not exposed to a basic elbow escape. But because the knees are so wide now, when she goes to stop me from inside elbow escaping, it's embarrassingly easy to throw my knees to the inside position. If on the other hand, she pinches her knees together and she brings her knees down and her foot down, now it's going to be difficult to go into an inside elbow escape because I don't really have the proper inside position with my right elbow from here. But I can wedge my partner's knee in place long enough to go over, trap it, and put it between my legs. And now from here, we scissor the legs, we exploit my partner's knee, and we go into a half guard back on the opposite side. So we play a basic dilemma game where she has me mounted, we take a hand to cross, and we take an elbow inside. She cross faces me heavy. From here, I'm going to go into a basic elbow escape. If from here my partner drives her knee up so high where I just absolutely can't expose my partner's ankle, you just bring your knee inside and hit a quick inside elbow escape. A lot of times you won't even have to bring your hips up off the floor because your partner's knees are already so far apart. If on the other hand, my partner sprawls the legs back, this time I can't go into an inside elbow escape because my elbow will slip off the outside of my partner's knee. So this time instead, I just wedge my partner's knee in place. When she goes to stop me from trapping the ankle, it's a pretty easy thing to reach over, trap that ankle, scissor the legs, expose the knee, and move to a half guard. Now we can also escape to the opposite side. Many times what you'll find is that your partner's so caught up and trying to stop you from moving into an escape on this side that all of her defenses are on my right side of the body. So from here, many times I'll be able to hit a quick switch where I go from one to two and I take my hand through and I post on the opposite hip like so. And now from here, she goes to put a strong cross face, I just straighten my leg on the opposite side. And now from here, as she goes to start stopping me from gathering her ankle on this side, I can reach over many times, I can quickly go in, trap her leg, and now as I come up, I come up right into a deep underhook where if she doesn't put a wizard on, we go into attacks on our partner's back. So I'm not going to say you can't escape to the opposite side that you're looking, but it's going to be much harder. It's always going to be much easier to escape to the side that she's pointing you towards with the cross face. But your partner knows that most of your escapes are going to come on this side. So that being said, you can switch across to this side and hit a quick switch where I go in and I trap my partner's foot on the other side and I move into half guard. So a lot of times it's a good misdirection where I start the escape on the one side, the side that everyone always goes to because you're looking in that direction, and then as your partner's concentrated all her defenses on the other side, we could make a quick switch. We switch the cross hip post, we take the inside elbow, and then hit a quick transition to escape on the opposite side. So you can go back and forth to both sides, but it's always easier, of course, to escape the side you're looking to. All right, so now into the moves that everyone wants to see. Kipping. Kipping is a very interesting escape and move in general. It's a move where if you are good at it, and if you master it, you look like a goddamn rock star every time you do it. And if you get good enough to the point where no one in the world can hold you down, and your kip is so good that you can have the best guys in the world mount you and just immediately kip out, people are going to look at you and be like, why would I ever even mount that guy? And that's what you want. But up until the point of mastery or even competence, you look like a complete idiot flailing around the mat. And it just looks like a complete disaster. You have a guy on top of you who shouldn't be able to hold you down, and you're just there flailing your feet back and forth in the wrong direction. It just looks terrible. So my goal today is to teach you guys how to look less retarded as you're doing this until the point of competence and mastery. John gave us like two details for like six to eight months and just let us flop around on our own. And he's like, I'm gonna give you like half of the kip and then I'm gonna let you figure out the rest by yourself. And it was just like the worst six months of my life. I was having like, I was like 17. I was having like 300 pound guys mount me. I'm trying to kip and I'm just like getting crushed under mount and I'm just like, this is terrible. But now I'm at a point where no one in the world can hold me down. So I guess he was right and ended up paying off. So we're gonna go into kipping escapes now. And whenever your partner, as you flattened out with cross faces, under hooks, things like that, that's the time for kipping. And we'll talk a little bit more about that as we progress into this kipping series. All right, so this is a drill that you can practice and it is, it is important that you do practices at some point. But it just, again, it looks really stupid when you're doing it. I actually just recently taught a seminar in Wisconsin. It was a sold out packed mat with 100 people. Like when I say packed, like it was a packed mat and I made them all do this drill and it was just 100 people doing this drill. And just when you see the drill, you're going to picture it and you're like, wow, that looks, that looks really stupid. But it's super important to get the mechanics right. When I go into a bridge and then a bridge, a shrimp and then a kip, I'm looking to go again from that full contraction or that full extension into that full contraction. So I want to end up in a concave position. So I'm going to start, I should make her do it so we can all laugh at her. I'm going to start by putting two hands on my partner's hips and imaginary hips like so. I'm going to bridge out to one side like so. And I'm immediately going to come into this concave position where my knees come into my chest like so. And now you would have your top knee on your partner's tailbone and you would have knees and feet together. And now I have a concave shoulders and the kip is this motion where my feet and knees join together as if they were tied together. And I pump my feet to and from my buttocks like so. A big mistake everyone makes is two big mistakes is number one, their feet move independently of one another like they're swimming. They look like this or two, they're kipping and there's no connection of the knee to the tailbone and they're just flopping around like this like they're having a seizure. So I bridge, I go into this concave position and now I start kipping. And you can do this in circles where I start moving along the mat and bridge the other side, move to this concave position and now from here I start kipping. And you can do this without a partner, without carrying body weight just to get in the motion of having knees and feet together and having that pumping motion to and from your butt. You want the knees and feet together. Another mistake people make is that when they go to do this, this happens or this happens. Their feet and knees separate and their feet move independently of one another. Their knees drift away from the tailbone. These are all things that are going to lead you to looking like an idiot when you're trying to do this. I need to imagine that my feet and knees were duct taped together, that there was someone pushing my knees up against my partner's tailbone and that there was a mechanism which required my feet to pump in unison to and from my buttocks. These are all super important details and you can get the mechanics down by doing a solo drill for a few minutes a day before you're ready to practice full kipping against resistance in live training. Now let's look at what types of kipping we have. We've already looked at side kipping to a degree. There are three main types of kipping. There are overhead kips where I take my partner directly over my head. There are kips where I take my partner diagonally over a shoulder and there are kips where I kip along the floor and out to the side. There are specific applications for these. Overhead kips are less relevant unless you're dealing with someone who's pretty low level. If I have someone who has a terrible mount, which is actually like most world class block belts, if I have someone who has a terrible mount and they're flattening me out and she has a cross face in, I can take her overhead and I can just bridge straight up overhead and then just kip and take her straight overhead versus over a shoulder. So she has a strong cross face and mount, I just bridge straight up and I take her straight overhead so that we land in the same position. There's no angular change the whole time and then we can go into either a butterfly guard or ashi garami or other forms of escape. When you're dealing with people who are more advanced, like five people in the world, and you have to be able to kip against someone who actually knows what they're doing and has a cross face, you need to use kips over your shoulders. We'll talk about this a little bit more in a minute. When she has a situation where she has a cross face, instead of going straight overhead and kipping against my partner's body weight, I kip and I take my partner over her shoulder instead because there's a drastic angle change as we go in and now we can kip much easier against higher level people. There is finally a side kip where instead of kipping and bringing my partner up and over my shoulders, I move out to the side and we start kipping along the floor. We kip as a side kip and now from here we bring our legs in and go into our sub-raise. We looked at the side kip a little bit before from side control and now there's going to be a bigger, larger application for a mount. So we have three major types of kipping. One is directly overhead, one is over the shoulder, either shoulder, and one is a kip out to the side where my legs are parallel to the floor and I'm kipping along the floor out and over to the side and bringing my partner down towards my hips rather than up towards my head. So now let's look at why we would even kip in the first place. There is a simple dilemma which is so, so important to you fully understanding this mount escape system. If my partner is postured up or she's sitting back towards my hips and there's weight over my hips, whether she's sitting physically on my hips or whether she puts her hands on the floor and she's sitting and pushing weight back towards my hips, anytime that my partner is sitting back on my hips, this is not the time for kipping. Everyone tries to do it from this position, that's not the time to do it. Understand that if my partner is crowding my hips, this is a time for knee elbow escaping, not kipping. You need to be a master at both knee elbow escapes and at kips. If you just are good at one or the other, you're not going to be able to escape a high level player's mount. So if my partner's crowding my hips, this is always a time for knee elbow escapes. What my partner is going to have to do now in order to stop me from knee elbow escaping is she's going to have to put a heavy cross face in or she's going to have to dig an under hook in and she's going to have to crowd my head by coming forward and crowding my head like so, where now it's going to be difficult for me to go into knee elbow escapes. Even if there was no under hook in place, it's still hard for me to go in knee elbow escape and get a good purchase on a good player's knee on the inside. I'm not going to say it's impossible, you can knee elbow escape from these positions, but it's much harder on players the higher level you go. But when my partner is leaning forward and she's crowding towards my head with a cross face or with a cross face and an under hook, now because she's crowding my head, it's the easiest thing in the world to go into a kipping escape. So understand the game that you're playing here. If your partner is leaning back towards your hips, you can't kip, but you can always easily go into a knee elbow escape. The only way that your partner can stop you from knee elbow escaping is by putting in a cross face or an under hook and crowding the head in some way. If she continues to sit back towards my hips, there's nothing that she can do to stop me from knee elbow escaping. The only thing she can do is that as I go to knee elbow escape, she puts in a heavy cross face, up the side, puts in a heavy cross face for example, and now it's going to be hard for me to knee elbow escape. But from here, I can go in and I can easily start urging my partner out to a side and start kipping out and away. The only way that my partner can stop the kip effectively is by leaning weight back towards my hips. And now from here, I go back into a knee elbow escape. So the game is simple. If your partner crowds your hips with their hips, you knee elbow escape. If your partner crowds your head, then you go into a kipping escape. And the dilemma game is a simple one. In order to stop a kipping escape, she has to sit back towards your hips. This will always elicit a knee elbow escape. Whether it be a basic knee elbow escape or an inside elbow escape, it doesn't make a difference. The only way your partner can stop a knee elbow escape is by effectively crowding the head and coming forward with a cross face or under hook and putting pressure to flatten you out to make it hard to get inside purchases on your partner's knee and starting to elongate your body. Okay? So in order to go into a knee elbow escape, I need to have this contraction like so. So I can make space and bring my everything inside. When she elongates my body with a cross face or an under hook or a cross face and an under hook, now from here, a knee elbow escape becomes increasingly difficult on higher and higher level players. But kipping becomes increasingly easy as my partner starts to crowd my head. This game that you're playing between knee elbow escapes and kips is so, so important. This is going to be what's going to get you out of a very high level player's mount, assuming they understand the relationship between kipping and knee elbow escaping. If you both understand kipping and you both understand knee elbow escaping, you're going to have to go back and forth between the two as your partner adjusts between sitting back towards your hips and crowding your head. Let's look at our very basic and overhead kip. This is basically when someone is driving so hard into the cross face that they're basically just leaning all their weight up to the shoulders. Like a guy from 20 years ago who thinks that the whole purpose of the cross face is just to make the guy uncomfortable. That's not the purpose of the cross face. It's to pin the guy so you can isolate limbs. So this comes from when a strong cross face comes in and a guy is just like ramming himself up towards your shoulders and the overhead kip is easy. Which shockingly is most people at black belt level, which is mind boggling to me. But anyways, we're going to be in a mounted position. And she's going to come in and she puts a strong cross face in. And the first thing we're going to look to do is we're going to look to take hands inside of our partner's hips. Now what we don't want is we don't want slippage off the hips. If my elbows are flared out, we get slippage off the hips, especially when we start moving into kips where we take our partner up and over a shoulder where hands slip off. Even worse than slippage is if my elbows are flared, my partner just punches in an underhook and now it's much harder to kip with one hand. So the first thing I want to do is I want to immediately take my hands to my partner's hips. Now she'll be trying to punch an underhook in. As she does that, I bridge to get her hand to the floor to stop an underhook. I simultaneously, as I put her hand on the floor, I put my elbow underneath my own hand and underneath my partner's hips. So as she gets to put an underhook in, I just bridge to this position here. So that's much harder for her to put an underhook in. My elbows connected to my rib cage and I have a much less chance of slippage with my grip. Now she puts a strong crossface in and she just starts ramming herself up towards my shoulders, like so. From this position, I give a bridge straight up, like so, and I move into this concave position and you see what it does to her hands. Her hands now are forced to the floor and my head is underneath her chest and there's no longer a crossface. From this position, I just take my knee up to my partner's tailbone. You can do either knee because you're symmetrical from here, you're not bridging from one side to the other. I take one knee and I just place it on my partner's tailbone. Now the whole thing from here, move out quick, move out of my way, the whole thing from here is to create a motion where my feet pump to and from my butt as my knees pull my partner's hips over my head. So I have a constant knee to tailbone connection. As my knees rise, my feet pump and that is what gets your partner's feet to open and eventually bring a knee inside. Don't number one, push your partner down towards your hips. This is counterintuitive. You're trying to take them up and over your shoulders. So I see a lot of people connect the knees to the tailbone and they try to bring their knees up as they push their hands down and then you're just going in two opposing directions and everything falls apart. In addition, don't bench press your partner up and over you thinking that it's about me pushing my partner over my shoulders with my hands. That's not it. The frames on the hips aren't to physically push my partner off. They're just to guide my partner. So the legs do the work and my hands just monitor the hips so she can't drop back down into a position where she's mounted again. My goal is to get my knees inside and underneath my partner's hips with a key insertion point being your partner's tailbone. I want to insert my knees right inside my partner's tailbone, split the center line and now from here we can bring everything inside. So she's coming in, she puts a strong cross face in, she drives forward. I give a bridge straight up and I go from a full extension into a full contraction like so. I take a knee to my partner's tailbone and two knees together. She goes to start mounting me, one, two, three, four, five, knee comes in and now from here we put the legs to the inside and we're already going to Ashi Garami. We put one knee in if we want to go to Ashi Garami, we put two knees in if we want to go to Butterfly Guard. So if I want to go into a Butterfly Guard position and forward shift my partner, she puts a heavy cross face in, drives forward and now we can go into Butterfly Guard and start attacking our partner. So we did a basic overhead kip. We bridge, we go to this concave position, kip, kip, kip, kip, we take our partner right overhead. One more angle real quick. She goes to drive in and now we're into Rimi Ashi Garami, Butterfly Guard, ready to go into all of our counter attacks. So this is a basic overhead kip when someone is just driving up towards your shoulders and trying to put on a super heavy cross face. Now we start to deal with more advanced people who are relatively balanced with their weight and not just driving towards your head. Kipping over a shoulder is going to be a much better way of kipping because you're not kipping against your partner's full body weight. The purpose of a kip when you're talking about advanced kipping is to kip against the lock of your partner's legs and not the full weight of your partner's body. So what I'm looking to do when I'm looking to kip over a shoulder is I'm looking to get weight onto one of my partner's knees first and then the kip isn't kipping your partner's full body weight over your head. It's just to separate your partner's legs. So I'm going to first start by bridging to get weight on one of my partner's knees. You can have a strong cross face in like so and I'm going to use the same method we used before to bridge and get my elbows underneath my hands here. Now I'm going to bridge to one side with the intention of getting my weight to Sunny's left knee. That's all I need. And now from here I go into this concave position and I connect my top knee, my left knee in this case, to her tailbone. Notice how immediately when I move into this concave position the robustness of her cross face is immediately compromised. My head slips underneath her chest. Now when I go to kip I'm looking to pull everything overhead. So I take knee, top knee specifically to tailbone, right knee to buttocks and now I kip and I bring everything over my head and I kip, kip, kip. You'll notice what actually separates is the lock of her legs. Once her legs separate, now I'm out, knee comes in and we go into a Rimi Ashi Garami. So the goal is to get my partner's body weight onto one of her knees and the purpose of the kip is the kip, kip, kip, kip, kip and the ankles kip, kip, kip, kip, kip, separate and then once the ankles split apart the space between the knees is exploited and we can bring our knees back to the inside position. The main issue again I see with this is 1. People doing this. That's never going to get you out. 2. Moving the legs in some fashion with no knee to tailbone connection. Or 3. As they go to start kipping their legs separate and flail around and there's no precision with my knee to tailbone connection. Everything has to be precise. I bridge to one side, usually the side I'm looking to for a cross face. It's the side I start on at least. And then from there I'm looking to get weight onto one knee. As I get weight onto one knee, the kip is what separates my partner's legs. My hands, the knees, are what pulls my partner over their shoulder and my hands guide my partner's hips so she can't resettle down back into mount. So I bridge like so, we bridge like so, and now we go into a kip. She goes to hold me and from here we're in. What it will look like is a quick bridge. As soon as I bridge I go right into a kip. She puts a strong cross face in and she's legitimately trying to hold me in mount. The cross face comes in and from here we go to work. This is the most advanced form of kipping. You're going to need to use side to side kipping when you have an incredibly good pin specialist. The number one mistake I see when people go side to side and they start kipping is they initially start with their knees up high by their shoulder and then as they go across the other side the knees drift away from their partner's buttocks, the two knees of the top person come back down to the floor and they try to hit a kip to the other side. This is never going to work. So what I mean is they bridge to one side and they start kipping. Now as they try to go to the other side they bring their knees down in a U shape and they go up to the opposite shoulder. It may not be that exaggerated but it'll be something like that. So they start to one side, they start kipping, kipping, kipping, their knees drift away from the chest and they come up to the other side. What this does is it ensures that your partner's knees will come back down to the floor. So I'm kipping against my partner's locked legs, now the knees are to the floor and now I don't bridge my partner to the opposite knee, I try to start kipping and both of her knees are on the floor and I'm kipping against her full body weight. So what happens is I get a perfect bridge, I off balance my partner, I get weight onto one of her knees. Now I start kipping, kipping, kipping, she tries to recenter by putting her second knee on the floor, that's what she wants. So as she goes to do that my knee drifts away from the chest, from my partner's tailbone, from here she recenters her two knees, puts them back on the floor and now I try to kip to the other side and the kip is not nearly as powerful because you're working against the cross face, if she reinserts the cross face, your partner's two knees are on the floor and you're kipping against your partner's full body weight. Okay? When I'm kipping from one shoulder to the next, it is absolutely imperative that my knees, rather than coming down and away from my chest and then coming back up to the other side, my knees start by coming up to my right shoulder and then as I move across to the other side, they move in an upward fashion diagonally towards my left shoulder. So I move in this fashion. So instead of forming a U shape, where there's a disconnection, I keep the connection the whole time, so I move from my right shoulder upwards diagonally towards my left shoulder and I can keep a knee to tailbone connection the whole time. So instead of this, it's this. The whole time I'm pulling my partner up and over my head with my knees coming to my chest. So now what this looks like with my partner on top of me, is I bridge to one side, I get weight onto one of her knees. Now from here, I start kipping, kipping, kipping, I feel like my knees are almost in, but I just can't get them. She goes to recenter and put her two knees on the floor. If she can do that for any amount of time, she's going to keep me pinned. So from here, I bridge, I'm going to start kipping, I fail, my knees come up, up, up. So now her knees are centered, but they're not on the floor. And now I tilt her to her right knee and now I start kipping in the opposite direction and from here, my feet fire into place. This is so, so important. You need to keep a strong connection of your knees to your partner's tailbone as you start moving from side to side. And your top knee will switch. If I'm kipping to my right side, my top knee is my left knee. So my left knee is connected to my partner's tailbone. If I'm kipping to my left side, my right knee is now my top knee. So now my right knee is connected to my partner's tailbone. So they shift as you move across the body. So she's mounted on me. I bridge, I start kipping, kipping, kipping. She goes to recenter and we move across to the opposite side. She's mounted, I bridge, I start to the side I'm looking towards. So I can get a strong bridge to get her onto one of her knees. Kip, kip, kip, kip, kip. I'm almost there, but I'm not. She goes to recenter and from here we're into a Rimi Ashi Gura. I want this to look like a little bit more live. She has to hold me down. We fire ourself into place, ready to go into counterattacks. Against the best people, this is what's going to be necessary. You start one side and you move from side to side. And just because you go from right to left doesn't mean you're done. If you have an exceptionally good pinner, it might be three, four, five, six times back and forth from side to side. It might look like this. And my knees finally come in. And the whole time, every time I go side to side, I'm constantly pulling my partner up and over my shoulders so that eventually my knees can get inside and underneath my partner's hips and create that space between my partner's knees. Now what your partner starts to realize is that if they just have a cross face and you start the initial kipping action, what they're going to do is they're going to relinquish the cross face. They're going to post their hands on the floor. They're going to push weight back towards your hips. This will give you two good options. Number one, we can go right into a knee elbow escape or we can go into a side kipping action. Both are very good. So the second I see that I put my two hands on my partner's hips and I try to start bridging out and over to the side and start kipping, my partner will go from a cross face. She'll feel this. She's like, Oh, there comes the kip and she'll put her hands on the floor and she'll push back towards my hips. So now from here, I can't bring my partner's hips forward anymore. The second I see this, I make a grip change to a cross post and I just reinforce the frame like so. And now I have a choice of one, either inside elbow escaping, two, straightening a leg and going into a basic knee elbow escape or three, because I was already going into a kipping motion, I just hit a side kip out to the side. Where from here, as she goes to sit back, I started by kipping. I have weight onto one of her knees already. From here, I just point my knees out in parallel to the floor and I just kip, kip, kip, kip, kip, and I bring a knee to the inside position. Now from here, I just shoot a leg through. I take my right knee to my partner's hip and from here we shoot right into a Rimi Ashi Gurami and we're ready to go. So because I have my partner's weight already onto one knee, a side kip becomes very easy. So I start going in initially, she's a strong cross face and I go and I start bridging and getting weight to one knee. The second my partner feels the kip, she pushes back towards my hips. I see this, I take a cross post in and from here I just angle my knees out a little bit further and we just start kipping out to the side, like so. And now we have a choice of going into a Rimi Ashi Gurami or pulling two knees in and going right into attacks with Tsumegeshi. So what this will look like is something like this. I go to kip, the second she feels the kip, she puts her hands on the floor and she pushes weight back towards my hips. Now we go in and we're free. I go to kip and we bring the legs in and we're free. It is incredibly hard for your partner to stop this dilemma. If you start a kip and you have weight onto one of your partner's knees and she keeps the cross face, bring her forward. If she pushes back, use that momentum to just go right into a side kip and just create space between your partner's knees. Use the kipping motion to separate their legs and then bring either two knees inside or a knee inside and throw your legs up into a Rimi Ashi Gurami and start to go into attacks on your partner's legs. This is a game that's so hard for your partner to stop. When she's coming forward, kipping overhead, kipping over the shoulders. If she pushes back, go into knee elbows or go into side kips and separate your partner's legs in different ways and either recover to full butterfly or Ashi Gurami. All right, let's look at how we can use kipping to deal with some of these other leg positions. We looked at a long hook as one of the leg positions and we looked at a situation where my partner has one knee up. Oftentimes when we're trying to knee elbow escape, my partner will stifle me with these leg positions. Many times, she will have me mounted. I'll start to give a bridge to go into a knee elbow escape and my partner will put a long hook in behind my back like so and now this will make the knee elbow escape hard because of the fact that I can't move my hips away because she's scissoring her legs and she's using her right knee to pull into my lower back and I can't move out and away. Many times I'll go to knee elbow escape and my partner will step one leg up and she'll have one knee up and one knee down and she'll move into a situation where from here now there's no knee elbow escape because of the fact that I don't have access to my partner's knee to push it down and expose my partner's ankle. What can I be doing in these situations to use kipping to start off-balancing my partner? This is generally from a situation where I start a bridge, try to go into a knee elbow escape and my partner switches leg positions and counters me. We're going to look at using a long hook first and then go into a situation where one knee is up. The first thing I'm going to look to do is I'm going to look to take my elbows inside like I'm going for a knee elbow escape. I'm going to bridge to one side and I'm going to try to attempt to start shrimping away from my partner. Now, she's going to switch to a long hook which will inhibit my ability to start shrimping away and I'll have to switch to a kick. We go in, we start bridging and now from here I feel like I can't shrimp away. The second I see this, I just fall back down to my back and as I do that, I use my legs to pendulum from one side to the other like so. Now I have weight on one knee on the opposite side. Now you see her knee here is off the floor and now from here I just start kipping, kipping, kipping and we go from one side to the other and we start the initial knee elbow escape to one side and then we finish with the kipping escape on the opposite side. So from here we hit a beautiful misdirection. So we're dealing with a person who is advanced leg pommeler. She goes into a situation where she's trying to pommel a long hook into place. I try to go into a knee elbow escape and it fails. From here I immediately just swing my legs to the other side and I use the momentum to take her knee off the floor. Right now it's hard for me to kip because I'm on my partner's leg and I can't move my hips in the correct way from here. So from here I just whip to the other side. She's trying to re-center anyway. So now she gets to put her knee down. We go in, we kip to the other side and now we can move out and away. So what this will look like in a moderately live scenario. Something like this. And now we're out and about ready to go. So I can counter long hook scenarios where it would make it generally pretty hard for knee elbow escape with a misdirection where I go knee elbow escape one side, kip on the other side. Similarly this time I start with a knee elbow escape on one side. She steps a knee up so I can't go into a knee elbow escape. I hit a kipping escape back to the other side. Same thing. This time I'm looking for my basic knee elbow escapes and as I go to start bridging to one side my partner immediately tries to slide her right knee up and she steps her left leg up. Like so. The second I see this I just move to the other side. Okay, why? Because my partner is willingly taking her knee off the floor for me. This is what I need. I need one knee off the floor. So from here I just whip my legs back to the other side and from here as she goes to re-center and put that knee back down she can't put the knee back down anymore because of that cross hip post. And now I just start a kipping action out and over the head and from here we insert the knee and we're in business in the Rimi Ashi Gura. So I see I go to bridge to one side, my partner steps a knee up so I can't access my partner's ankle. Whenever I see that I just whip back to the other side, I bring everything overhead and I use that cross frame of my partner's hips to stop her from re-centering and putting two knees back to the floor. So we go in, we get the hand to cross, we go for a bridge. The second I see this, immediately she goes to start putting underhooks in or what have you. We just bring everything across the other side and we can easily kip out. This is what it looks like. A little bit faster, bridge to one side, she counters by stepping a leg up and I move right back to the other side. Now we're ready to go and expose our partner's heel, move back to butterfly guard, whatever we want from there. So again a beautiful misdirection. We start one side, we get our partner's weight leaning back to center and even towards the side that we're actually looking to escape to, we start bridging and shrimping right and then we finish kipping left.
