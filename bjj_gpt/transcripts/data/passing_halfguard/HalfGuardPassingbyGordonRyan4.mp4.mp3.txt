 Oh, that was the wrong one. It doesn't look too bad. Make sure the arms fit in. We're almost there! I don't know why that clip was in there but Sonny wanted to do a double leg and make it a clip so I hope you enjoyed that. He's so heavy boy. Alright, after that double leg scene from the last clip I'm hoping that you're all refreshed and can concentrate now again on this boring jiu-jitsu that we're about to do. So we're looking at butterfly half guard now. Now some differences with butterfly half guard, obviously my partner dominates the inside position at the lower body and this makes more of a difference when you get chest to chest because even though you're winning the upper body battle for inside position, your partner is now winning the lower body battle for inside position. So it gets a little bit more tricky when you get chest to chest and we'll talk about that later. But it also presents some more issues when we're looking to go in and get to over back grips or initially get chest to chest because of the fact that my partner can off balance me much easier. So we're going to run through of course situations where my partner has little to no upper body grips, double shoulder pose and cross shoulder pose. And number one, making scoop grips from here will be difficult because of the fact that my partner's legs are inside. And also when I go to come in chest to chest, you have to be careful with your weight distribution because of the fact that your partner can off balance you. So when I come in chest to chest, I can't come in and drive so far towards the far shoulder and flat my partner out because now she can take me in that same direction and off balance me and start going into my legs. You have to be careful with your weight distribution and your leg position when you go into hip switch to over back grips. There's no tension running through my legs from here. When I go to switch to over back, she can lift me with a butterfly hook and start to give me some issues from here. So it's going to be different now getting in chest to chest. And you have to be very cognizant of where you put your weight because of the fact that your partner can so easily off balance you with this butterfly hook. Okay, so a couple of key differences is number one, obviously my partner's legs are safe now. My legs are more in danger because of the fact that she has two legs inside and it's going to be a lot more easy, a lot easier for her to off balance me and I'm coming forward into her to crash the far shoulder and going for those over back grips. So we have to adjust a little bit here. All right, so now instead of boring you with the same redundant information and just going over the same stuff again, I'm just going to cover all of the methods that we previously looked at to get chest to chest or to an over back grip from butterfly half guard. And that all of the stuffing methods, the rising methods and the hip switching methods all remain the same, pretty much the same. Whether your partner has tight elbows, whether they have a double shoulder post or whether they have a cross shoulder post, we're still going to be looking to come inside the bicep ties. I'm still gonna be looking to climb up our partner's body with clubbing methods or pulling the hand down with cross shoulder post and getting to over back reps or flattening a partner out. There are a couple major differences with our leg position that we have to be cognizant of when we're looking to either crash the far shoulder or go into an over back grip. Because your partner has a butterfly hook, again, it's a lot easier for them to off balance you. Whenever someone's trying to off balance you with two legs inside with butterfly hooks and going to an ashi garami, they're looking to dominate the space between your knees. She can at any time dominate the space and control the space between my knees with her butterfly hooks. She can enter into an ashi garami and look to go into her offensive cycle. My entire goal when I'm looking to come forward and crash the far shoulder or go into an over back grip is to dominate the space between my knees by keeping her heel connected to her butt. If I asked you to do a leg press, it would be a lot easier to push a lot more weight from this position where my legs are already extended. The closer my knees get to my chest, now if I asked you to press the same amount of weight, it would be a lot harder from this position. It's the same thing when I'm trying to extend my legs away. If my heels are glued to my butt, it's a lot harder for me to move my partner out and away than if I start from this position here. That's why when we're looking at body lock passing, for example, the first thing we do is we suck the heels into the butt and pull the butt into the heels. Now if my heels are glued to my butt, when I go to extend her, it's hard from here. And if from here, she moves back and away a couple inches, now when I go to extend her, it's a pretty easy thing. So my goal when I'm looking to crash for a shoulder or looking to go into a hip switch to go to the over back grip, my entire thing, my whole thing is to keep heels glued to the butt with a proper leg position. So we're going to go in and however we're going to get past our partner's butterfly hook, we have to either go in and we can stuff like so, we can come through and we can play a game where we go past the top leg. We can look to use rising methods where again, we come up, we lift to go in and we pass our partner's top leg. These methods are all the same. Same to the over back grip, coming inside, stuffing the leg, do that double shoulder push, coming inside, stuffing the leg, getting to an inside bicep tie and pulling myself in. All the upper body battles are the same. The lower body battles are different. Understand that if I go to the hips first, if I go to the weight first, you can stay with square hips and square legs. If I stuff the leg on by and I come down to this position, now I can stay with square legs because of the fact that my weight is all the way back on my heels. When she tries to elevate me left shoulder to go into Hashi Garami, she can't do it. It's when I come forward is when I run into problems. If I try to come forward and crash to far shoulder and I have square legs and hips, she can elevate me easily now left shoulder and enter into Hashi Garami and start to give me issues. Whenever I go to come forward to my partner's far shoulder and she has a butterfly hook in place, I have to use this very specific leg position. I take my left knee to my partner's hips. My left leg, my outside leg comes forward and in this case, I turn my hips ever so slightly and shoot my right leg back and away. So I have a scissoring effect where my left leg comes forward, my right leg shoots back and away and I hit a back heel like so. So now my partner goes to move me around the butterfly hook. I glue that heel to the butt. I pinch my knees together. I have that scissoring effect which makes it very hard for my partner to off balance me. When my partner goes to off balance me, even with pinched legs, if I have my knees pinched together and I go to crash the far shoulder, she elevates me, no problem. This time I move from the hips. I go to crash the far shoulder. I scissor my legs. I have proper leg position. She goes to elevate me. There's just nowhere to go from here. So I play this game where my knee comes off the floor. I turn my hips slightly. I scissor my legs with a strong back heel of my right leg. Then she goes to move me around from here. It's a very difficult thing. When I go into a hip switch and I move to an over back grip, it's the same thing right from here. I turn my hips. My knee comes slightly off the floor. I hit a strong back heel and a scissoring effect with my legs as I pinch my knees together. So when she goes to off balance me, she can't. If I just go to sit to the over back and I'm here, she goes to hit a strong off balance and I get way off balance out and over to the side. Whenever I go to sit to this over back grip, especially when my partner has a butterfly hook, I move to this position here. Now she has to move me. It's not an easy thing. Now from here, I got to flatten my partner out. I get to an under hook for example. I go in, I go to crash the floor shoulder. She goes to off balance me and I'm here. I never come forward square because now I get off balance and I start running into problems. So everything remains the same as far as getting to a chest to chest position or getting to an over back grip, but you have to have a very specific leg position that glues your partner's heel to her butt where you dominate the space between your knees by keeping the knees pinched together and using a scissoring action to stop her from off balancing you. So let's take a look now at some differences between this over back grip. My partner has a knee shield versus a butterfly hook. When my partner has a knee shield in place and I sit to this over back grip, I end up here. She's looking to keep the knee inside so that from here I can't look to start flattening her out. I can switch to scoop grip so I can look to start taking an elbow inside and I can do all that good stuff. When my partner has a butterfly hook in place, she's now looking to start off balancing me and looking to start moving me out in this direction and getting me to the space of my knee and expose my back or at least recover, things of that nature. So yes, if at any point your partner makes it easy for you to start circling towards their legs and this knee comes out of the pocket of your head from here, it's a pretty easy thing to start walking my partner flat. So I'm not going to bother going over all that again. I can always, if my partner's knee slips out, I can walk towards my partner like so, keeping my legs scissored. And now from here we can go in and start making a transition to a cross face and under hook and working just like we did before. So if at any point I sit to this over back grip and my partner's knee comes outside of my hip like so, or I can move it outside of my hip like so, it's a pretty easy thing to start walking my partner flat. So we've already done that and it's pretty much the same order of operations with the butterfly hook. And now where it changes is I can start to start back stepping with various uses of scoop grips or V grips and using that to start converting to scoop grips. So I move into this over back grip like so, and now from here, if my partner does nothing, he doesn't even try to off balance me from this position, I'm just going to take a V grip on my partner's butterfly hook like so. If I just try to back step, she just follows me and tracks me with the leg and then I get off balanced. So instead I put a V grip in place like so. So now when she goes to follow me, it's the easiest thing in the world to back step out. My partner has her legs locked around me in the half guard. I can't back step out because she can pinch her knees together. So I first have to convert to a scoop grip to dominate the space between the knees, slide my shin across, and then I can back step out. But here she has no knees pinched around me. The only thing I have to worry about is my partner's bottom leg trapping me from stepping out and the butterfly hook off balancing me. So from here, I just sit to an angle. I post on my partner's ankle like so, and now when she goes to follow me from here, I just point my knee to the ceiling. If I try to back step with my knee parallel to the floor, I get caught in my partner's bottom leg. So I point my knee towards the ceiling, she goes to follow me and stop me with the bottom leg, and I just back step out like so. And now, depending on what your partner does, it's a pretty easy thing to start going in and passing from here. We can go in, we can start collapsing your partner's knees together, we can step over, we can start, if our partner goes flat, we can follow them back down, switch to a cross face and go inside the biceps, and look to go into side control. Or probably the easiest from here because your partner's going to be turning towards you is just from here, blocking your partner's hip, taking our ear down to our partner's hip, and from here, we go through and we circle into north-south. So a lot of similarities here. We sit to this over back grip. If my partner's knee is outside my hip at any point, from here it's a pretty easy thing to just walk my partner flat, and then from here we start building up to the upper body, of course scissoring our legs like we should be, and then moving into attacking positions with pins chest to chest, we're going to start going and passing into top pins. If my partner's knee is inside my hip from here, if I can't get it outside the hip, then from here we just go in, we attempt right away to take a V grip. We take our knee, we point it towards the ceiling, so my partner uses his bottom leg to try to trap me. It's a difficult thing. I try to back step from here, my knee's pointing along the floor, get caught at that bottom leg. When she gets to entangle me with the bottom leg, I just point my knee up. She gets to keep a strong grip, let me back step through. And now from here, depending on where your partner goes, it's a pretty easy thing to start going in and passing your partner in various ways. So using a V grip to pass off this over back grip, my partner has a butterfly half guard, and I sit through with the hip switch. Remember that if at any point that knee comes outside the hip and she gives you the inside hip position, you can also walk your partner flat, flatten them out, then go to crashing the far shoulder and getting chest to chest. Okay, so this time, a lot of times when you V grip, you get off balance because you don't really have any control of your partner's body. You V grip but you have the over back grip, and then as you back step, you're not entangling your partner's legs anymore, and you start running into problems from here. So what happens a lot of times is the second I go to back step past my partner's legs, I back step, I get past the legs, and then what happens is they use a high elbow to start... No, no, just even here. And from here, I go to back step, my partner gives a quick bridge off the floor, lifts the elbow, and I start to get off balance in this direction. Maybe I don't fall all the way over, but what happens a lot of times is maybe she puts a foot on the floor, she goes to bridge, I end up here, and then as I go to recover, she brings her knees to elbows, and then I come back onto frames. So a much more robust way to do this is the second I V grip, and I go to back step, I V grip, and instead of just taking my hand out and doing whatever I'm going to do with my right hand, I switch immediately to a scoop grip, and I dominate my partner's hip line with my shin. So the second I go to back step out, I back step, one, and now from here, I switch to a scoop. Now when she goes to lift me, I slide my shin across. So now there's no lifting action, she can't bring her knees to her elbows anymore. When she goes to lift me up towards the head, just not going to happen. When she goes to push me down towards the hips, the shin's in the way, wedge against her hips, and it's not going to happen. And now we use our same scooping series, and we pass from here, we're going to other various attacks. So if you feel like for whatever reason, you're going to back step, and your partner times you. So sometimes as I go to back step, I go to make a recovery, and now from here, my head gets taken off center, and now she just brings her knees to elbows, and I come back, and I run into all of my partner's frames with knees and elbows connected. So I go V grip to scoop grip, and I counter her initial escape and off balance by using the scoop grip and dominating my partner's hip line with my shin. The second I go in, I go to back step out, and she goes to off balance me, we catch. She goes to move me around and recover from here, and from here, we're into our scoop grip passing series, just like we did before. So once again, whatever it looked like, I go in, I back step through, sorry, I hip switch through, I get to this over back grip. The second I go to back step, she goes to off balance me. And we're in, ready to go into various follow up attacks with pins or submissions. So switching from a V grip to a scoop grip against someone who's looking to take us overhead and connect knees and elbows. All right, so now we're going to look at a situation where we go in and we hip switch and we get to this over back grip, and my partner elects to start off balancing me. And my partner isn't going to just sit here. If my partner just sits there in that position for any amount of time, I use a V grip and I just start back stepping. But more commonly, what's going to happen is the second I go to back step, my partner is going to start off balancing me from left to right to try to create space. So this butterfly hook is a great way to do that. Where she, from here, can look to start off balancing me to her right. Then from here, I was going to push back, she goes to off balance me left. And I go to sit back and she goes to off balance me right. So then eventually what happens, I either get off balance too far in this direction and get knocked over. I get off balance too far in this direction, have to take my knee out to base and she pulls her knee in and recovers or exposes my back. Or I over commit, so as she goes to off balance me this way, I push back and then from here she off balances in the opposite direction and she has a zentashi garage. So this is her general game from here. So we're going to look at two passing series, two passing options with a contention around where my partner's knee is pointing. If my partner's knee is pointing towards us and she's trying to off balance me out like so, we go into one passing series. If my partner's looking to point her knee in the opposite direction, we go into a separate passing series. So we play a dilemma game based around the direction of my partner's knee. If my partner's knee is pointing towards us and she's off balancing us towards her right, from here we go into one passing option. If she's off balancing us out and away and over to her left hip and her knee points away from me, now we go into a second passing series. So we play a passing game from this over back grip against the butterfly half guard based around which direction my partner's knee points either towards us or away from us. All right, so now we're going to look at a situation where our partner's knee is pointing towards us and they're trying to off balance us overhead to the near side. And we're going to look to initially keep our partner's heel glued to the butt with proper leg position and then on one of those off balances, we're going to allow our partner to extend us further than they expect it to go. We're going to shove our partner's leg down and step right over into a mounted position. So what this will look like is we get this over back grip with the butterfly hook in place and from here she has to start off balancing me. I have good leg position, she's trying to rock back and forth and off balance me, all right, she's not going anywhere from here. Now eventually she's going to create enough space and enough momentum to start getting real off balances. So I don't let her do that. I let her go one, two, maybe three, four times from side to side. And then as she goes to extend towards me, I open up my hip and my knee and I let her extend further than she expected to go. Now I take my hand to my partner's knee like so and I just stuff my partner's leg on through. I take my knee and I connect it to my partner's tailbone on the opposite side. So when she goes to scoot away from me, the hips are controlled. Now I stay in this over back position until I can expose my partner's, the back of my partner's knee to my heel. What I don't want is for her to create ankle exposure, step over and trap my ankle in three quarter mount. This is worst case scenario, still a great passing position. But if possible, what I want to look to do is I want to put my foot flush in the floor, keep my knee inside my partner's hip so she can't knee elbow escape of course. And then from here expose the back of my partner's knee to my heel. So that now when I go to mount, I lift my partner's legs with the back heel and I hide my ankle. And then from here I slide my knee up and now I two feet cross. I fix my hand position so that my partner's head is between my two arms. And now when she goes to knee elbow escape, we can counter very easily with a cross face and under hook and go to work from top pins. So whenever I see my partner goes to off balance me in this over back grip, it's a butterfly hook. We're playing a game where we have good leg position. She goes to move me around, it's difficult. Now from here, she goes to start off balancing towards me, the knee points towards me. We open up the knee and the hip and we let her go. Now as she goes to start extending me overhead, we step up and over like so. Now from here we stay with this over back grip. We look to expose the back of our partner's hamstring and knee to our heel. She goes to stop me from doing that. I just dig my leg underneath like so. And now from here I lift everything. I swish in my leg and I hide my ankle from my partner. She goes to start recovering. We take the head between the hands. Now we're ready to cross face or under hook on either side, flatten our partner out and stop her from making an escape. Whenever I see my partner is doing a good job of off balancing me and creating motion side to side, I wait until one of those off balances come in the direction, come to the side that I'm sitting on, the knee points towards me and I let her go further than she expected to go. As she goes to off balance me, I just stuff the knee and a quick step over into the mounted position and then work from there. Okay, so we beat the butterfly hook with a step over into mount and then we go from either three quarter mount, worst case scenario or best case scenario, we hide the ankle and we work from there. All right, so now we're going to look at taking an inside elbow and sliding across the three quarter mount if my partner's knees point away from me. Now let's take a look at why one works in a certain position and doesn't work in another position. If my partner is in this situation here with an over back grip, this butterfly hook in. If my partner's knee points towards me like so, it's a pretty hard thing to get an inside elbow and start to walk my partner's legs away from me because she's pointing her knees towards me. So if I try to use an inside elbow and get my elbow inside and she goes to off balance me in this direction, it's a hard thing to actually get my elbow inside there. So it doesn't really make sense for me to use an inside elbow in this position, but it does make sense when she goes to extend to step over. If you look at the flip side of this coin, when she goes to extend me left shoulder like so, now it's a hard thing for me to step over her knee because when I go to push the knee down, she just flares the knee out and then connects her knee and her elbow or takes her hand up to her knee and stops my, just put your hand here, and stops me from stepping over. So if the knee is flared outwards away from me and I go to hit that step over and shove the leg down, it's a pretty easy thing for her to stop me. And now because there's so much space between my knees, she just off balances me left and I'm in Ashi Garame. But what it does do is it makes it easy when she goes to point me in this direction to take my elbow inside my partner's hip. So this is the game that we play from here. So I play a game where if my partner's knee points towards me, it's almost impossible or very difficult to get an elbow inside. Okay. Even if it's not that drastic, it's hard for me to get using an inside elbow effectively from here. But it's a very easy thing for me to step over. When she goes to stop me from stepping over from here, it's not easy. If on the other hand, her legs, her knee points away from me. Now when I go to step over, the knee flares out. It's hard to step over that knee. That's an easy thing to take an inside elbow. The second I get an inside elbow from here, I immediately just take my body and I rise my hips, I raise my hips towards my partner's shoulders like so. As I do that, I block my partner's ankle with this inside elbow. So my elbow and my thigh connect. So that from here, when I go to take everything forward towards my partner's head, that butterfly hook will slip out or at least below my knee. That's all I need. Once the butterfly hook is below my knee, I just take my knee and I slide it right across to the hip. Now my partner has no choice but to lock into a three quarter mount and start to control me from this position. Now once I'm in this position, we have again a variety of different ways to pass. We can go in, if I can get an underhook like so, we can go in and we can pass with an underhook here. We can pass it over under like so. We can pass a double under like so. We can use a butterfly hook to start inserting and freeing and passing to either side with leg pommels. I can use a knee slide to come up. I can knee slide across. Once she goes to control me from here, I just sheer my leg out and away. And now from here, we can either go in, pass the side control. We can start leg riding and control our partner from here with two feet behind her legs. She goes to move me around from here. I can pass the side control, knee on belly, the opposite side. She goes to move me around from here. I can pass the mount. There's many different ways that we can go from here. Most common one is from here. I can't get any upper body inside position, so we just go through and we fight to get a cross face. And now from here, we can flatten our partner out, walk her out and away, and I'll fill her pommel and legs in, in the traditional fashion that we looked at before. There's many different ways to go from here. The best of all is if you can get double underhooks. So ready, you can do this with good group fighters, but if I can get double underhooks, she gets to move me around, do anything offensive from here. It's just so difficult. Now we can go in and start attacking your partner from various top pits. Okay? So we play with this knee direction dilemma. If my partner's knee points towards me, inside elbows don't make sense, but stepovers make a lot of sense. If my partner goes to point their knee away from me and off balance me left shoulder, stepovers don't make much sense, but inside elbows make a lot of sense. For now from here, I take my knee, or sorry, my thigh and my elbow together. She goes to keep a butterfly hook, a sticky butterfly hook above my knee. I look to go in and start playing here. Now from here, we can play in various different ways with different hand configurations. Until we get past the side control on either side or mount the position, I'm ready to get on two attacks. All right, so a basic dilemma with our partner's knee position. If the knee points towards us, stepovers are easy. If the knee points away from us, inside elbow position is easy. And we either step over into mount or slide the three quarter mount first and then work from there. All right, so now another great way that we can beat this under or this butterfly hook from an over back grip. You can also use this when your partner has their own under hook and is looking to attack you, we'll look at that a little bit later, is to hip switch by blocking our partner's hip with the over back grip and hip switching past our butterfly hook. So when I get to this over back grip, like so, I have the over back grip and normally have a hand posted on the floor like this. Whenever I see my partner is looking to extend me, maybe I get a little bit overextended and I feel like I'm going to lose the position of my partner's knees and to come in, a lot of times I'll block my partner's hip with this right hand. So I can do this either proactively or reactively. Proactively when I want to just go in for the pass, I can just pull my hand inside and now from here I can take my shoulder down to my partner's hip or I can do it reactively where I feel like if I don't put my hand in place, my partner's knees are going to come in and she's going to recover. So I physically block the knee from coming in by just putting my fist here on the floor and blocking my partner's knee from coming in. And now as my partner goes to extend me, I just take my ear down to my partner's hip, I just hit a quick hip switch past my partner's legs. So as she goes to extend me, the hand comes out from the far side, it comes through to the near side. As she goes to extend me, we just go to the hip switch like so and we put our ear once again down by our partner's far hip. So now when she has to bring those knees inside, she can't. She tries to turtle, I can pin my partner's hips and her coming up to turtle position if she wants to will be very labored and slow. That gives me more than enough time to either go into front headlocks from here or go back or just completely as she goes to start coming towards me, spin around my partner's body and from here start going into backpacks or pins on the opposite side. So what this look like is we're over here, my partner has a butterfly hook and I can do this proactively or reactively. Proactively is when I just take my hand in place and now from here, she's not even trying to move me around, I just take my ear to my partner's hip and I hip switch. I can do this proactively or sorry, reactively. Once she goes to extend me, we go in and we hip switch and I make sure that my ear comes to my partner's hip. If I try to do this with poor head placement, my partner goes to extend me and I go to hip switch, she'll just lift the elbow and then that will happen. I'll hip switch and I'll end up way out far away from my partner. I make sure as my hips come out in this direction, my head moves in the opposite direction down towards my partner's hips. I can't have my head coming this way and my hips coming this way, you end up way too far away from your partner and she can easily recover. I make sure when I go to hip switch, I have the goal in mind of taking my ear down to my partner's hip, my shoulder down to my partner's hip. So now when she has to move me around, the hip switch on by, we have that good ear to hip connection, that good shoulder to hip connection. And now when she has to move from here, it's a pretty easy thing. Start making passes into side control, north, south and side control on the opposite side or taking your partner's back or going to front head or whatever you choose to do as your partner reacts. But a great way proactively to hip switch, if I want to just move past my partner's butterfly head quickly or two, if your partner goes to off balance you, you can reactively block the knee from coming in and then hip switch past and go to your attacks after that. Now let's look at quickly going over passing with the reverse underhook. Now when our partner has our legs trapped in this reverse underhook, in a traditional half guard, we can go in, transition to a scoop grip and pass like we did before, right? We can go in, take a scoop grip, we're going to use an inside elbow to start sliding across and it's pretty easy to start working like we did before. My partner has a butterfly hook in place. Now my partner can't push me down the bottom, it's hard for me to switch to a scoop grip if my partner starts off balancing me this way or pushing me down the body and extending me. It's a difficult thing to switch to a scoop grip. So I use the same series I used from the over back grip. I play with the knee direction dilemma. If my partner goes to off balance me towards me, I push the knee down. If she goes to off balance me away, I slide the three quarter mount. And if my partner is sitting here, I feel like whatever the case is, maybe I'm losing position, maybe I just want to switch to a scoop grip. I go in for a V grip first, I go into a back step. I don't have to disengage my partner's legs if I don't want to. I use a V grip, I back step, and I just open my knee up. And then from here I switch to a scoop grip and now you have the same conversion that you have from a traditional half guard where you make a conversion from a butterfly half guard to a regular half guard and you play with your same scoop grip series here. So you use the same series that we just looked at. If the knee points towards me, I let her extend, I step over, and now from here we start beating our partner's legs and then playing a game from there. If my partner goes to off balance me towards me and then from here she goes to switch directions, we slide across to the far hip. And we can always switch to a V grip and from here either back step completely and switch to a scoop or just open up my partner's legs, convert to a scoop, then slide a shin up and across our partner's hips and then work to extract our leg or spin the leg and start passing from there. If you have a reverse underhook, using the same dilemma with the knee position and V gripping to get into a scoop grip to start going into getting chest to chest or passing your partner or going into other various attacks. All right, so now just very quickly, assuming we can't get chest to chest or we just want to go into other attacks from a butterfly half guard, all the Kimuras and all the Darce setups that we did all remain the same. We just got to beat the top leg and we can start going in for Kimuras and working from there. Now, when we go into these attacks, when we go into these, it's only day two, it's only day two of filming. We're going to be here for a week. When we go into these attacks, understand that your partner does have more ability to off balance you with this butterfly hook. So when I go to start batting myself into a situation where I go into Darces, I have to make sure that I stay at that same staggered leg position. So when she goes to move me around from here, that's not as easy. Or when I start going into Kimura, when she goes to move me around from here, it's not as easy. So this is super important to have one knee slightly off the floor and that staggered leg position. So keep that in mind when you're looking to go into attacks. In addition, if at any point I feel like from here, I don't want my partner to have a butterfly hook in anymore and I feel like I can't clear the butterfly hook. I want to make it maybe a conversion to a different guard or I want to force my partner into a traditional half guard. At any point, I can V-grip my partner's leg. You can't just step your leg up and try to pummel it out because then your partner grabs your ankle and enters into your leg. So this is no good. So if at any point I want to look to backstep, I have to go in and post a V-grip on my partner's ankle. And now from here, I can post the hand. I can backstep out and I can put my knee inside and I can force her into a traditional half guard. Or now from here, she has to go to a knee shield first and then maybe she can pummel my leg back in and we're playing this pummeling battle. But if I want to convert it from a butterfly half guard into a regular half guard, I use a V-grip and I backstep out. And now from here, my partner has to either bring a knee in to regard fully, like so, or if I block a knee, I backstep to my blocking knee and I step back into a half guard. She has to bring a knee shield in place. And now we're in a traditional half guard, not a butterfly half guard anymore. In addition to this, she's a butterfly half guard. I want to look to start clearing my partner's butterfly hook. I can take this lace, people weave their hand through the legs like so, and I can start pummeling my own butterfly hook into place. And now from here, I can look to start turning and pulling the leg free. Or now I can start converting to leg drags. If my partner starts to face me, I can either pass to this side or I can fall back and start going into attacks to my partner's legs. There's many different things you can do off of that conversion. So if I want to start going into attacks here, I can take my hand through and place it on the floor like so. Now from here, I can either one, just step a leg up and pull a leg by. Understand this will, if your partner gets to an ankle, leave you exposed to an ashi dorami. Or, if you want to make sure your legs are absolutely safe, the first thing I do is I just pummel a butterfly hook in, the same way we did before. And now from here, I take my hand through and now when I turn my body, she gets to keep that hook in. My leg is safe. She can't expose my leg anymore. And now from here, I'm in the driver's seat where I can go in, start passing this side. I can start casting my leg over and start going into all kinds of different attacks here on my partner's legs. So another great way to extract my opponent's leg if I'm not comfortable with this butterfly hook is from here we come in, we pummel our butterfly hook in. And from here, she goes to start moving around and pull the leg through. And now we can start climbing up our partner's body. We can start throwing our leg up and around. We can come through and she can open the knee. We can sit back and fire our leg through. There's plenty of different things that we can do from here. So a couple of ways to attack, making sure that if we go for dar sukimura, we have good proper leg position with the splitting of the legs and pinching of the knees. And if we want to transition from a butterfly half guard and force my partner back into some kind of regular traditional knee shield half guard, we can use either back stepping or we can look to pull leg across to the far hip and look to walk around to the opposite side or pass or go into attacks from there. All right, so now we've gotten past some of the basic stuff. We've gotten chest to chest against various lower body, upper body grips and frames. And we pass from over back grips. We've established that the two great ways to start passing from half guard are either to one crash the far shoulder and flatten the guy out or pass through an over back grip. Um, and many times we've worked on, uh, many times passing from the over back grip is going to be your best option because nobody wants to get flattened out. We worked on either passing from an over back grip so far or flatten people out and then stopping there. Now we're going to look at how to actually pass people once they're flattened out, um, with various upper body and lower body, uh, hand and leg positions. Um, this is going to be pretty in depth and it's, it's going to be, um, there's going to be a lot of, not only how to do things, but why would I do this? Um, like I said, why would I do, why would I use a top head and arm versus double under hooks? Why would I use over under versus double under hooks? Why would I use just a cross face versus a top head and arm? Um, and it's going to be a lot of, uh, a lot of why would I make transitions here when I wouldn't make them if my opponent was doing this, this or that. Um, so it's going to be a lot of why we're doing things. Um, and everything's going to make sense by the time we finish, you know, cause you see people passing half guard, you see some of the best half guard passes in the world. And um, you know, some people use, prefer to use double under hooks. Some people prefer to use a top head and arm. Some people prefer to use just a cross face and walking their legs down and pushing the knee down. Um, and you ask yourself, well, why would a guy do this when he could just use this other grip? Um, it's a similar thing with, you see high level guys crossing their legs from certain arm bars and you're like, well, this guy's crossing and this guy's not, why would I cross during one arm bar and not cross during another arm bar? Um, so we're going to have those, the answers to the, to the why, um, in this section. So I'm excited to get into this and uh, here we go. All right. So before we jump into this, we're going to a very general hierarchy of hand positions. Um, starting from the least tight, the loosest grip to the most advantageous position we can be in when we're passing from half guard chest to chest. Um, now there are specific times where I would use one of the looser grips, um, versus one of the tighter grips is very specific. Um, uh, games we play from here, depending on what my partner is doing defensively and all or counterattacking offensively. Um, but in general, this is a pretty general, uh, way to look at things and we'll dive into why one of these is ranked higher than, than the other as we move on and start passing. So first, just from a standard half guard, our in general loosest grip that we look to look to work with from here, it's just a basic cross face from here. We have no control over an underhook or working with just a cross face. Maybe we have a hard time punching an underhook in here and we use just a cross face or from here, I like to come in and start putting my forehead down the floor like so. And we'll talk about mechanics of actually putting in a strong cross face as we move on, but we'll just look at just a cross face for now. Number two is a cross face and an underhook otherwise known as a top head and arm. Where from here I have my hands locked. I have a closed wedge around my partner's head and arm. And from here we can go in and we can start passing. Okay. So we have a cross face first, top head and arm second. Stronger than that is a near side underhook like so where we can come in and we can start using near side underhook to start blocking my partner's near side knee and elbow connection and making it impossible for her to lock a side guard, which we'll talk about a little bit later. We're using near side underhook and we start to go in putting a forehead down on the floor and start passing. After that is an underhook and a head block where I take my head and I move it to the opposite side and now I use my head to serve as a cross face. So instead of having an actual cross face and having two of my hands occupied with an underhook and a cross face where I wedge my partner's head and shoulders in place, I take my head and I move it to the opposite side where now I have the same effect as a cross face with my head and I have an underhook in place, but I have the luxury now of a free hand to post with or to start moving into other various hand positions. So we have a head block where you move our head from one side across the center line to the opposite side and post it on the head and block our partner's head. After that is off of this head block position an over under position where I have one underhook on the far side and I have an overhook on the near side where now my partner goes to post to my hips or move me around and you do anything with this arm, it's difficult to do that to lock the side guard when I pass. That's a pretty easy thing to start going from passing from there. And a king of them all is double underhooks where I go in, I switch my head, I go to an initial head block and I punched double underhooks in, I get both my partner's elbows above the shoulder line if I can, and I start passing with my head on one side or the other, depending on what we're trying to do from here. Okay. So this is a very general hierarchy. And again, there are very specific positions where maybe a double underhooks, even though it's generally stronger, isn't what I'm looking to do from that position. And maybe just the crossface in there is stronger. Okay. So this is a very general, generalized hierarchy of hand positions going from the loosest to the tightest. And then we can work from there. And then there's very specific times where we use one versus the other. But this is just a very general idea. Get thinking about this as you're training and you're dealing with someone who's maybe a strong bridger, for example. Maybe it's best to start moving into double underhooks, controlling both the arms so they can't post on your hips and things like that, which we'll go into as we start passing from here. All right. So now we talked about hand positions. Let's talk about elbow position. And understand that you can form multiple circles with your hands. All right. And I can start by going in 10 finger. It's the largest circle. So we can go from large circles to small circles. This is the largest circle when I lock my hands at a 10 finger grip. If I go palm to palm, it's a little bit smaller circle. If I go wrist to wrist, it's a little bit smaller circle. If I go figure four, it's the smallest circle. Obviously because we're controlling our partner's head and arm from here, it's unlikely we're going to be able to lock with a full figure of four. So we're going to be looking at using either grips with locked hands with 10 finger grip like so, palm to palm, or wrist to wrist. Or unlocked hands with underhooks or just cross faces as we looked at before. And understand that the tighter the circle you have, the more wedging you have around your partner's head and shoulders. So if I use a palm to palm or a wrist to wrist grip, I will have physically tighter wedges around my partner's head and shoulders, and it will feel tighter from bottom position and from top position. But that also brings your elbows closer together. And the closer your elbows are together, the less base support you have. If I go from a 10 finger grip, where now my partner has a lot of space to move within the lock of my hands, yes, it's not as tight, but my base support is much wider. If I go to a palm to palm grip, my elbows will come a little bit closer together. If I go wrist to wrist, my elbows come in closer together. So you have to, this is more of a person to person type basis, where you look at the explosivity of your partner. And if they're super, super explosive, I generally prefer to use either unlocked hands completely or looser grips where I can still control them and have good wedging around the head and the shoulders, but a wider base of support so that if they give a strong bridge, I have a wider base of support because the elbows are farther away from one another. And if I feel someone's uber explosive, I generally prefer to use unlocked hands where I use a head block, for example, or use a cross face. And that gives me the ability to have an under hook here and then a wide post hand where my partner goes to bridge. And now my elbows are way further apart than they would be if they were in any locked configuration. What I mean by this is here, she feels that there's almost no pressure as far as wedging around her upper body and her shoulders and her head. Here she feels a little bit tighter in the lock. And here when I go wrist to wrist, now she feels this good pressure on her when I lean forward and start putting my head on the floor. But understand that the tightness of the lock comes at a price of base of support. So if my partner starts bridging either over her right shoulder like so, or if I start tripod and she starts bridging her left shoulder, my base of support now can be compromised. If I'm dealing with someone who's super explosive and I have wider hands like so, now when she goes to, or I have a 10 finger grip like so, when she goes to start bridging, my elbows are much wider. Whereas if I'm here, I get off balance much easier. Okay? So that may not always be that drastic, but it will make a difference. So in general, I generally prefer a compromise where I go in, I don't use the loosest grip, but I don't use the tightest grip against people who are super explosive. I generally prefer to use a palm to palm grip like so, so that I have a good lock, I have a good wedging around my partner's head and arm, and it's hard for her to free the elbow, to free the cross face. But I also have a decent base of support with my elbow position. And if I deal with someone who's super, super explosive, what I generally prefer to do is switch my head across where now I have physically open hands. So now my elbows are way, way far away from one another. And now if my partner goes to bridge in either direction, there's just no way she can off balance me from here because of the base, because of the width between my elbows. So understand the relationship between the tightness of the lock and the amount of base that you have. The closer the elbows are together, the tighter the lock will be, and the tighter your partner will be physically wedged in place by the lock around your partner's head and shoulders. But the less base of support you have, the wider your elbows come apart, the more your elbows separate, the more base of support you're going to have, but the lesser partner will feel that she's wedged in place from bottom position. So this is super important. I generally, as a general rule, I generally prefer if I'm going against someone who's isometrically strong and not very explosive, who doesn't have very good timing, I generally prefer to use a tighter lock because I don't have to worry about an explosive brick taking me over. If I have to deal with someone who's maybe not as strong, but super, super explosive, I generally prefer looser locks on a compromise between a 10 finger and wrist to wrist, which is somewhere in the middle using palm to palm and maybe slightly wrist to wrist like so, or if they're very, very explosive, then I just bypass that altogether. I use a head block and I just post hands on the floor so my elbows are very wide apart and even the strongest break won't be able to take you over because there's so much space now between your elbows. So just general rules and the relationship between robustness of grip, tightness of grip and base support as your partner bridges. All right, so we talked about our upper body grips, talked about elbow position, we talked about hand position, head position. Now let's talk about our standard starting initial lower body position. All right, we're going to talk about goals in a second and one of those goals is what your partner's trying to do with the lower body and they're either trying to knee lever you or they're trying to insert a butterfly hook. All right, those are the two basic ways your partner has to escape besides just aggressively bridging and hoping for the best. Okay. So what we're going to look at is our standard starting position with any variation of our upper body grips where from here we go in and we take our knee slightly off the floor like we did before. We're going to do that same turn where I wedge my knee right into my partner's hip like so, I take my knee slightly off the floor. Now if your knee is on the floor, your partner will start to go in for knee levers, okay, and start to off balance you. The knee lever is countered by raising the knee off the floor. So when she goes to knee lever me now, she won't be able to. But when the knee comes off the floor, she can easily insert a butterfly hook. So how do I deal with this dilemma? If I'm on my knees on the floor, I get off balance. If my knee comes off the floor, then the butterfly hook comes in. If my knee's on the floor, she can't insert a butterfly hook. It's much harder for her to insert a butterfly hook. Okay. So from this position, my starting position is I always want to walk my partner's legs towards the center line. I don't ever want my partner's knees facing towards me in this position here. She can bring a knee back inside, knee back inside. She can use a knee shield to make space, pummel her hands back inside, and give me all kinds of problems. She can pummel a butterfly hook in. She can look to start off balancing me, bring her right knee inside, and then recover to a butterfly guard. Everything just goes south from here. So the first thing I do when I force someone into half guard is I immediately scurry towards the center line. Here. Like so. I put my toes on the floor. I turn my hips slightly, and I put my knee connected to my partner's hip. Now from here, I take my right knee and I walk it to my partner's far hip, the left hip in this case. So now when she goes to knee lever, she can't. When she goes to fish for a butterfly hook, my knee's in proper position. The further my knee drifts towards the center line and more drastically towards the near hip, the easier it'll be for my partner to insert a butterfly hook and start off balancing me. This is not what I want from here. I don't want her to put a butterfly hook in place. So from here, my default starting position is a slight turn of my hips like so. I scurry towards my partner's center line and start pointing my partner's legs away from me the best I can. Now from here, I take my right knee, my trapped leg, and I glue it to my partner's far hip. Keep your legs up. I glue it to my partner's far hip the best I can, slightly off the floor. When she goes to knee lever, it's hard. When she goes to insert a butterfly hook, it's hard. When my forehead comes down to the floor and she goes to start bridging, there's no effect. I make sure I don't align myself with my partner's body and have my left leg align with my partner's body like so. If from here, because my hips are turned, she gives a strong bridge, you can get off balance. So I make sure my head goes down to the floor and I take my left leg and I flare it out like so. So when she goes to bridge towards me, she bridges into my base of support here. When she goes to bridge away from me, I pull my left knee into my partner's hip and that wedges me in place. So when she explosively bridges side to side, you don't move anywhere. And now from here, we're in a good, standard starting position, ready to go in and start working in two passes from there. Okay? So that's our standard initial starting lower body position to stop a person from initially bridging, inserting a butterfly hook, knee lever, off balancing you, and then recovering right away. All right. There's another important theme we're working with when we're passing from half guard. If you're chest to chest and you can get your knee to the inside hip or to the outside hip, you should be passing pretty much anyone from there. The discrepancy in your partner's ability to escape and recover and your ability to pass when you get your knee to the floor, there's such a huge gap in the option they have and the options that you have. They should be passing, even if you're a blue belt, you should be passing world-class black belts from here. Especially if you have a situation like double under hooks and you have perfect upper body position and you get a knee to the floor, it's so hard for a person to recover when you get that knee to the floor. So your whole goal when you're passing half guard, whatever grips you have from here, the best being double under hooks, for example, is to pike up and however you're going to do it, and we'll look at ways to do this in a second, is to come up, free the knee, and get your knee to the inside hip. She can do whatever she wants from here. She can freak out, she can move around. There's just almost no off balances she has from here. And now when she goes to make that recovery, I just go in, I easily pass, she goes to start freaking out from side control, and it's just not many options your partner has at all from these positions. Conversely, we go in, this time we dominate the outside hip. So we free the knee, however it may be, and then go to the outside hip. When she goes to start moving around now, I put my knee in the floor. When she has to start recovering, there's little to nothing that she can do from there, and we can easily start passing. So just play with this idea and have the confidence that if you're chest to chest and you can put your knee on the floor next to the inside hip, or you can put your knee on the floor next to the outside hip, the chances of you passing drastically increase. So have the goal in mind, however it may be, keep the head and shoulders pinned and get your knee to the floor on the inside hip or the outside hip. If you have, let's say your blue belt trading against the black belt, and you have a 15% chance of passing when your knee is trapped, you can now have a 90% chance of passing when your knee is dominating one hip or the other hip on the floor. The chances of passing go up so astronomically high that it's so difficult for the bottom player to recover, especially if you have proper upper body grips. So focus on getting the knee to the inside or the outside hip, and then start working the pass from there. All right, so now let's talk about some goals from these positions, and it comes down really to winning the battle for inside position. If I get chest to chest with my partner, it's because I've won the battle for inside position. All right, I'm chest to chest with my partner, my partner's trying to make space and get everything back to the inside. So if I get into a half guard, my goal is to maintain the inside position. If she can take her hands to the inside, then get her elbow to the inside, then get an underhook, and then start to off balance me and build up, now she's sealed the upper body inside position and starts to go into work from here. So I want to keep the upper body inside position. Now she knows that if I win the battle for upper body inside position, she's going to have to win the battle for lower body inside position. So she can do this if my knee's on the floor by starting to knee lever me out to one side, and then from here as I back step, she can take a right leg butterfly hook in, she can forward shift me, take a left leg butterfly hook in, and then she steals the lower body inside position, and then eventually the upper body inside position. If my knee's on the floor, she can start to go in and knee lever me, and from here I can pose to hand out like so, then she can steal the upper body inside position, and then from here as I come back, knee elbow escapes for example, then she goes back to the lower body inside position. So she can steal the upper body, or the lower body inside position first, and then beat me at the lower body, then at the upper body. She can also punch a butterfly hook in, where from here she can go in, she can start to off balance me over her right shoulder, and bring the knee back to the inside, and now beat me to the inside position. She can punch a butterfly hook in, and she can start to off balance me left shoulder, and start to go into attacks, and steal the lower body and upper body inside position once again. So she can start to play a game where she can beat me to the upper body inside position first, or if I'm winning this battle more than likely, she'll beat me at the lower body first, and then the upper body will follow, and she'll steal the inside real estate up there. So she's looking to play a game which will off balance me to get hands inside somehow, elbows inside somehow, and steal the upper body inside position. She's looking to play a game which will allow her to bring her right knee back to the inside, maybe she bridges, I don't follow, and she brings her right knee back to the inside, and then her left leg can come back to the inside, now she can go into offense. She's looking to use various forms of Kazushi, if my knee's in the floor, maybe a knee lever for example. From here, I back step, now her leg's coming back inside, she steals the inside position, or if my knee's off the floor, she inserts a butterfly hook, now she goes to off balance me in either direction, and she steals the inside position, and she beats me. So her path to escape is to find ways to incrementally fight back to the inside position at the upper body or the lower body. She can do the upper body first, she can do the lower body first, she can do the lower body first, and do the upper body second. She can do a combination of the two. She can fight one piece of inside position at the upper body inside, and one piece at the lower body inside, and then incrementally fight back to the inside. What I'm looking to do, is I'm looking to dominate the upper body inside position, which I already am because I'm chest to chest, and then I'm looking to dominate the lower body inside position by inserting a foot, a butterfly hook, inside my partner's leg to free my my knee to dominate the hip. So what I'm looking to do ultimately is to free my knee from in between my partner's knee line. I can do this in various ways. I can do it by posting on a leg like so, or I can do it through a series of leg pommels like so, where from here I free my knee, then I dominate my partner's hip, and now from here it's a pretty easy thing for me to pass. So she's looking to incrementally fight back to the inside position, that upper and lower body, and I am looking to keep the upper body inside position while simultaneously winning the battle for a lower body inside position and getting a knee to a hip to start dominating my partner's inside or outside hip. And if I can do that, I can pass. If she can stop me from doing that and fight her way back to the inside, then she can go into her re-guards and counterattacks. Importance of a high tripod. Importance. Importance. You see that? Importance. Importance of a high tripod. Importance. Listen, you're from Guatemala, okay? I even speak English. Okay, all right. Take two. Importance of a high tripod. All right, so when we're passing half guard, one of the big issues is because my body is more or less aligned with my partner's, big bridges either to the near side or to the far side can either one, knock me over, or severely off balance me and allow my partner to start recovering to inside position. What allows my partner to move me around with the bridge is hip to hip contact. The closer my hips are to my partner's, the more effect a bridge will have provided it's, the more effect a bridge will have on me, whether it's near side or far side bridge. So if I have direct hip to hip contact with my partner, like so, and see it's a strong bridge to near side over the right shoulder, like so, or over the far shoulder, like so, this will have a drastic effect on me. So it's very important that when I go to insert my butterfly hook and pass from this top-headed arm, we're gonna start from the top-headed arm first, that I move into a high tripod position. Okay, many passes that I look for with top-headed arm, with double under hooks, et cetera, et cetera, will be from a high tripod position. There's a famous case, it's not probably not famous to you guys, but it was famous in my development, where I'm trying to pass Joao Rocha's guard, and I think I weighed in somewhere around 225 for that, and he was 265, and super, and very explosive. And in the gym, when I'm looking to go in and pass everyone's guard, everyone plays an inside position game. So their whole game is built around bringing knees to chest and trying to insert butterfly hooks. So it's very rare that I actually deal with someone who explosively tries to bridge me from side to side. But in competition, that's really the only thing that most people have, is they start with an explosive bridge, and then they just kind of hope for the best. So in the gym, I always got away with pommeling a butterfly hook in, like so, and then just going into a high tripod after and passing, because everyone's trying to bring knees inside, so it's fine. But Joao timed it, and from here, he was able to give a big bridge. I can flare my leg out and negate the bridge. But I went to go pommel my leg in, and now I have no base support. So I went to go pommel my butterfly hook in, he bridged, and I actually fell all the way over to bottom position, and I was like, oh my God, did I, did that just happen? But he was able to do it because I wasn't in a high tripod, and he had direct hip-to-hip contact. So the importance of the high tripod is to separate your partner's hips from yours. So from here, before I go to do anything and pommel on a butterfly hook or go into any of my passing, I'm the first going to a high tripod, like so. So now my partner goes to give explosive bridges. There's no hip-to-hip contact. And so even if you have a narrow base of support, and I choose to use a wrist-to-wrist grip, for example, and I have the narrowest base of support, because of the fact that there's no hip-to-hip contact, my partner has a hard time moving me around. So you can play a game where you start with a looser upper body grip until you move to a high tripod, and then as you go to move to a high tripod, you can switch to a tighter upper body grip, knowing that your partner will have a hard time bridging you over because of the fact that there's no hip-to-hip contact. So even though you have a more narrow base of support with the upper body, you have a tight wedge around your partner's upper body, and because there's no hip-to-hip contact, it's hard for him to bridge you around. So I have tight wedging with a wrist-to-wrist grip around my partner like so, and now when I move to a high tripod, there's no hip-to-hip contact, so when she goes to move me around, I have a tight wedge around the head and the shoulders, I have, in general, narrow base of support with my elbows, but because my hips are no longer connected to my partner's, it's very hard for her to move me around, either with a near side or a far side bridge. So it's very important when you go to insert that butterfly hook and look to pommel into a situation where you can win the battle for lower body inside position, that you go into a high tripod first before pommeling the hook in to avoid your partner explosively bridging you over to the near side or to the far side.
