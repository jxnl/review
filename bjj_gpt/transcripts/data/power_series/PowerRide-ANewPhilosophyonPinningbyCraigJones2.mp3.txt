 We're going to cover a few different key principles on how we control the legs, again, in ways different to point scoring positions, different to the standard operating procedure. We're going to look to control the legs in such a way to abide by the overarching principle of this series, and that is if our opponents on bottom cannot get feet to floor, they cannot explode, and those explosions come in the form of bridges and hip escapes. We can mitigate explosions, we can maximize control. The first concept we're going to cover for lower body control is the idea of splitting the legs. So again, if Tyler lays down here, when he's doing his bridges, when he's doing his kipping movements, he has a form of control that keeps his legs together and they work in unison. So again, if he hits a bridge here, the legs start together and open as he bridges. If he hits some kipping style movements, you'll see his knees, he's largely trying to keep his knees together here. So if we're looking at these, again, hip escape, legs are together, knees are together. We want to split these legs to minimize his ability to touch these feet to the floor. So if we have Tyler's legs extended here, and I can split his legs apart here, I won't demonstrate the position just yet, but now if we see Tyler trying to do explosive movements here, we see him trying to put his feet to the floor. Very very difficult. And you're going to see how when we control someone like this, and they can't use their lower body to escape, they start to make mistakes with the upper body. So you saw as Tyler was moving there, he started to turn belly down. Horrible, horrible idea. But again, we're backing him into a corner where that might be his only option. Another option is he comes up to an elbow. He tries to build height here. Again, you can see where this is going to lead. This is going to lead into things like Khabib style Dagestani handcuffs wrist wraps. That's how he creates those opportunities. If guys can't use the lower body to move, they have to take some risk with the upper body. Again, it's either that or accept being on bottom and surviving for the rest. Obviously we don't have the luxury to punish people with strikes, but we have the luxury of punishing them with position. So again, in examples where if I've approached Tyler's guard here, let's look at it from this way. If I can start to smash Tyler's legs to the floor, what I'm basically using is my inside hip to spread Tyler's legs here. It's the same as if I were to hit a leg drag here. When we're in a leg drag on someone, we're essentially splitting the legs. This leg is splitting them. Obviously there's varying degrees we could split. The greater the top leg comes to the chest and the lower body comes away from the chest, the greater the split, the greater the control. But what quite often happens is we'll hit a leg drag and what do we want to do? We think, hey, we're not scoring points for this position. We want to score points. Tyler's option is actually very limited in a leg drag. It's very tough here. If Tyler can get his inside knee back inside here, he can start to recover guard. But if we commit our weight towards the legs here, Tyler's trying to move in this manner. Very difficult, right? So the leg drag in and of itself is excellent control. But what do we do? We forego control for points because we know that if we're able to get him flat here and look for a side control style pin, we are going to be rewarded. But if I would ask Tyler, where is he more comfortable? In a leg drag or in side control? From a submission perspective, he might say the leg drag only because he hasn't been passed yet. But in terms of where does he feel like he can move more, chances are side control because he can explode and he can start using those technical tight escapes. Again, just to emphasize, I'm not saying side control with elbow to knee and hand here isn't a good pin. I'm saying when we decide to move from this position to start looking for submission opportunities, he can use explosions and create submission opportunities. If I'm in a leg drag, I've got Tyler here. Tyler's trying to explode. Why can't he explode? He can't explode because the legs are split and he can't put feet to ground in any meaningful manner. So obviously, if the concept is to split the legs for meaningful control, wouldn't it make sense to maximize the leg split rather than maximize points? So how would I do that? We can start to split the legs even greater by using our inside foot. So if I have someone on a leg drag here, I'm not even thinking points. I'm thinking pinning them. Again, what's my definition of pin? Where he cannot move without giving us something worse. So if I want to split the legs more, I use an inside hook to maximize leg split. Now Tyler tries to move. He can't move. He tries to put his left foot on the ground. He can't do it. The more he can bend his leg, the more meaningfully he can put his toes on the ground. So a minor leg drag position, he can start to put those toes on the ground and generate movement. If we split the legs, Tyler's trying to put those toes on the ground, he really can't do it in any effective manner at all. And we don't have to stay in the leg drag here. So I can start to split the legs and then I can take a crab hook to split the top leg. Tyler tries to move here. You see what he wants to do. He wants to make poor decisions. And again, it's not necessarily he wants to make poor decisions. It's the only option he has. If we want to maximize splitting the legs, we can use that legs independently of each other. We can stretch the top and we can extend the bottom. And again, great pinning positions here. The overarching concept for this section will be split the legs to maximize control. So this will count broadly in many positions. BJ Penn used to pass people's guards in MMA with something called the dog mount. And how he would make that happen would be because this was prior to the days of inverting from butterfly guard and capturing legs. The MMA guy would be basically trying to sweep or stand up. So he would surf the hooks and he would split the legs by dropping his hips in between here. Again, these days I wouldn't necessarily recommend this because as I'm basically giving Tyler a cross arching inch as he pulls his head underneath, he can start to invert and attack the legs. But we can still use this position. We just need to change the angle. So this again would be another concept of splitting the legs. As I sit through, I'm not sitting square with his hips. I'm turning to a basic hip shift. So now as Tyler tries to invert, he can't move because we've split the legs. My right knee is extending his lower leg and basically my right hamstring and calf muscle here are pinning his top leg away from his bottom. If we needed to increase our legs with control, I could even use my hand to extend this leg. Anything we can do to prevent this knee coming close, when this knee comes close and the toes plant, he can meaningfully find explosive movements. So even something as simple as splitting the legs from here, we've just safely landed in what I'd call a variation of dope bounce Tyler's trying to move here. We think to ourselves, do we want to control him or do we want to score? If we want to control him, how can we further increase control? We can take another hook and start riding the legs like we just were. We still keep weight on the hips obviously, but Tyler tries to move here. We've got complete control of the position. So anytime you can split your opponent's legs, I want you to look to split those legs. Once you've split those legs, ask yourself, can we further split the legs? Because again, it's going to change. If I have a minor split, we've reduced his explosive ability, but we haven't shut it down entirely. So we want to create minor splits and then look for ways to increase the split. If we completely control the lower half, all your opponents will have is their upper body to fight out of the position. And really if we have pinned the lower half and they have to take risks with the upper body, the odds are stacked against them here. If they're using their upper body to try to posture up, we're going to cover this in detail. We've got wrist rights. But again, if I split the lower body and I reduce our explosive capability with the lower body and they have to use the upper body to find opportunities to explode, they're going to get absolutely exhausted trying to fight ways out of this position. When I train in such a manner, I find my training partners want to give me traditional point scoring positions because they're so uncomfortable and they're so unsure of where to go next. They want me to take side control. They want me to take a traditional mount because first of all, they have escaped from those positions. But second of all, they're actually more comfortable there because again, it builds. If I'm sitting in mount on a guy, he can keep his elbows tight, he can keep his legs together, his feet on the floor. He is comfortable there. He's not contorted. He has multiple escape opportunities. He has kips, he has bridge and rolls, he has knee elbow escapes. Look at the opportunities he has from there. If we go to leg split style positions, put yourself in this position, put your training partners in this position and ask yourself, how many opportunities for escape do you have? If I'm in side control on Tyler, there's tons of escapes. There's great reversals from side control. Obviously, they're low percentage, but they are there. Guys again, guys like Kelvin Gasson, Derek Lewis are so good from turtle. They just forepoint and shake guys off the top. Other guys are so good from side control bottom. They know how to use bridges to retake an underhook and re-come up. There are better control positions that leaves our opponents with less escape opportunities again than those traditional points scoring positions. Concept one, split the legs. Split the legs and if you can, increase the split to increase control. Riding the legs. This will not be a split. Obviously, we haven't covered it yet. It will not be a shelf. It will not be a tuck. It will be simply riding the legs. Another effective way to control the guy on bottom is to ride his legs. This can come up in tons of different ways. Basically, the core concept is if we maximize our weight distribution on top of the knees, just above the knees that wedges their legs together, it mitigates explosive movement. Again, following the key concept because it's difficult for them to put their feet to the floor. This one really controls them in a way that they're stuck on their side as well. I'll quite often use this if I'm in a typical mount and say someone starts doing a knee elbow escape here. The second they do, I sit back on the legs here. Again, you don't need to be too strict. Again, this is a conceptual section, but I'm applying weight to Tyler. Tyler faces the other way. I'm applying weight like this. We have the split. This isn't a split. We didn't have that luxury, but we're on top of both legs here. You'll see it's difficult for Tyler to move here. If I'm surfing his legs here and he's trying to move, he can't explode. You can see what did he try to do. He tried to wiggle around and then he tried to bring his upper body away from us. When the upper body turns away, the belly down becomes apparent. Again, we're going to cover this later, but we've got wrist rides. If we can't, say we're in a smash boss, we can't split these legs too basically, at least use a windshield wiper to try to surf and ride these legs so they can't move. Again, you can practice this conceptually with your training partners as well. Two legs on is always going to be better than one. Tyler's trying to move here. Very, very effective control. Superior control to any sort of control the IBGF is going to reward you with. The legs are together and there's weight on them. Sometimes you'll even be down here and we'll be surfing the legs. As Tyler moves, we can generate a better surf. As he starts to turn on his hip, we just stay at the knees. It's much better to control someone here than here. Here you're going to have submission opportunities, but their defense of this will too create submission opportunities. Again, we're here. What does this do? It straightens these legs. We know that straight legs, it's harder to put toes on the ground, feet on the ground to generate movement. What else do we know? If they can't bring their knees to their chest, very difficult for them to find comfortable positions to explode. We're extending the legs. We're pinning the legs. Again, reducing their ability to use the most explosive part of their body to destabilize us, potentially escape. Again, it immobilizes them in a way that they still have a little bit of hope. Their explosions in positions that they can't move is going to lead to fatigue. We know anyone that explodes in bad positions, obviously that's a poor decision, but it's going to ultimately lead to fatigue and submission opportunities. Surf the legs. Again, just to demonstrate, Tyler hits a knee-elbow escape to his right side. He starts to capture that foot. We can just surf on top of these legs here. It doesn't need to be well strictly defined as me being on top of both legs. I can have a foot in between, but look, if Tyler tries to move, he generates the same concept here. Superior control to what the IBJF has been telling you all these years. Let's talk about the concept of a tuck. Again, another move I've stolen from another sport, wrestling, foxtile wrestling as well, but a tuck is very, very useful when our opponent wants to stand up. When we're dealing with a modern grappler, we're not just thinking about the IBJF style grappler. ADCC style grapplers use a lot of standing escapes. I will still say it's early days for standing escapes being used in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu, but it's very common in MMA because, again, obviously with the context of rounds, if you're going to stay on bottom, shell up and defend, you've lost the round. They are a bit more common in MMA, but again, in Jiu-Jitsu, when we deal with grapplers that are very good at standing escapes, the key concept is just they're hard to control. A guy that's good at standing escapes is hard to pin, and not just pin in the wrestling context, pin in the context I talk about, is that is meaningfully control them so they only give us better opportunities in their pursuit of escape. What a tuck will do is we're going to basically isolate one leg and to a certain extent straighten it so they can't put that foot on the floor and they can't really retract that leg either. That can come up in many different ways, but my process of tucking is to hook the Achilles and extend my hips in, creating a form of open wedge around their leg that makes both retraction and planting difficult. The most obvious style of tuck would come from half guard. So if I have Tyler in half guard here, a standard half guard position is what Tyler has here. What you can see is a problem for our concept of control because he can bend his legs freely and he can place his feet on the ground at will basically, especially that left foot. When we're talking about a tuck, I want to be covering the Achilles with my Achilles here, I want to be tipping him. So now Tyler has to place his right foot on the ground, but Tyler tries to retract his right leg. Very, very difficult here. So I'm not relaxed, I'm tense here. I'm not so tense that my knee turns in because now obviously knee lever, very, very easy here. Generally speaking, that can be the enemy of the tuck. So we want to balance our retraction, we're flaring. We're flaring facing the direction they want to hit a knee lever or John Wayne when he tries it now. Very, very difficult here. And now look, Tyler starts freaking out using explosive movement. He can't create those movements in any meaningful way. We also have these turks come up. We have a reverse turk too. So if you pay attention to the control here, exact same Achilles and hip pressure here. Tyler tries to move. We've got superior control to any IBGF point scoring position. Tyler's opportunities for escape limited. His opportunities to submit a reverse basically gone. And again, it's that retraction, flaring and hip pressure. Even without hands, Tyler tries to get up. His only escape opportunities are presenting me with those better options, which would be wrist rides and also re-naked stuff. The turk can also come up. I won't go into too much detail. I just want you to understand the concept from turtle here. Generally speaking, if I have a front head on someone, what my goal is when I hit this chest to back weight transfer is to hook this leg. If I can hook this leg and pull it to me, I'm doing the same thing. Retraction and flaring, hip pressure and Tyler's trying to get up. Very, very difficult here. And again, leads us to our wrist rides and re-naked pressure. You can see how fatiguing it is for this 47 year old man, Tyler. A turk is a way to control while mitigating their explosive ability and the retraction of their leg. But the core concept of all these is that it's difficult for them to put the foot they need to on the floor. And if they can't do that, they can't really explode. And our control rate goes up. Hook, flare and apply hip pressure. Let's talk about shelving the legs. This concept can be largely seen in Khabib's game or really those Dagestani style grapplers. And it's built upon that folk style idea that you need to cover the legs, cover the hips to score takedown points. And again, we demonstrated that at the start, but it's basically if I hit a double and Tyler's on his side here, when he's on his side he's got opportunities. He's got opportunities for switches, crotch locks, he's got opportunities to get back up, just putting someone to a hip or to the butt isn't a great control mechanism, which is what frustrates me most about some of the rule sets that score a takedown when you put someone to the butt. That to me is where the battle for the pin begins. So when we step over the legs after a takedown, if we remain over the legs and shelf those legs like I'm going to show now, we have superior control. So let's imagine I've taken Tyler down here, right? I don't believe this should score yet, because if Tyler comes up to an elbow here, this can easily be reversed, right? So when I say step over the legs, what I mean is I step over the Achilles and I cross my feet here. So Tyler brings his head out this way. This to me is great control. I've shelved the legs with my left leg. Tyler tries to put his feet on the ground. And what do we think? If you can't put your feet on the ground, you can't hip escape or bridge. If Tyler tries either of those movements, super weak and you're going to probably embarrass yourself along the process, right? Why I believe this is superior to mount two, if Tyler, if he doesn't sit up, but he just tries to reach my knees, he can't push them. He cannot push them. He has to sit up. And again, what does that lead us to? Wrist rides, back taking opportunities. This is why I think combining the folk style step over for scoring with shelving the legs like Khabib is just much better. It's crazy to think that a guy like Khabib, I think in the true all encompassing definition of grappling is a superior grappler and could easily beat pure Jiu Jitsu guys in certain rule sets because I believe this is superior to mount. If I said to Tyler here, how would you escape this position? It probably has no clear path, no clear safe path. If I come here and I said, hit a few mount escapes from here, Tyler would have a handful bridging roll again, knee elbow escape. And again, most importantly, not only can his hands reach my leg, his elbows can reach my leg. Not only can he place his feet on the ground, but he has numerous ways. He can even trap my own foot from here and start to use those 10th Planet style half guard recoveries from here. So shelving the legs is any position where his legs are off of the ground, but it's a double leg control. Again, the Turk was mainly the emphasis of one, not as good, but it's still a very important concept and still a bridging concept to secure weaker forms of control that down the line lead to stronger forms of control. When we use the Khabib style step over here, and if I have Tyler's legs like this, he can't separate them, can't place the feet on the ground. So if there is an opportunity and they come up and take downs, they come up and we're in side control here. Why step here to a traditional mount where Tyler can now immediately go into escapes when I could step to a lower mount and now tell I see Tyler trying to escape. There's no clear path to escape. So when we shelf the legs, that's one of the most important concepts and one of the strongest positions we have conceptually in our approach to reducing the explosiveness, the athleticness, but even just reducing hip movement. What's the first thing you learn in Jiu Jitsu? A hip escape. So why do our forms of control not reduce their ability to use the day one technique of a hip escape? Let's talk about the ultimate form of control of the lower half. It's a concept, it's a position, it should be the ultimate goal in all of combat sports. Not just Jiu Jitsu, it should be in MMA, even in a street fight this would be your best position and I really struggle to figure out why we don't see it more often in Jiu Jitsu gyms and I think it's probably because we're all a bit too nice to each other sometimes. We try to find the most delicate way to beat someone. But obviously if I were to take a true rear mount and flatten out my training partners and do it as brutally as possible, it's going to be quite painful for them. But again, like all things, we don't need to do everything to the extreme. We can fit this into the toolbox without actually injuring our training partners and making it so, even just making them so uncomfortable they don't want to train with us again. There are ways we can use this and still keep our friends on the mat. So because the definition of back control is two hooks, we will see Jiu Jitsu guys elect to chair sit. So what would a chair sit be? Say for example I had Tyler in something like a gift wrap here, because the purpose is to get the two hooks, they're going to sit back and they're going to obviously body triangle or throw the two hooks in. Because our goal from that style of, because our goal is in a sort of standard operating style of Jiu Jitsu is just to maximize the point scoring positions and five submissions from there. Quite often the chair sit back take will present itself prior to the opportunity to flatten out a training partner. And because we're so eager to score points, points over control, we elect to take the chair sit and fight to finish them from the back. And again back is still a good position, it's just there are better positions and that would be to flatten Tyler out. If I were to maintain top position and keep working through some of the controls we're going to cover coming up, the best position I could have Tyler in, I actually waited until we ate lunch to film this section, so if I have two hooks on Tyler and we got him buried out here, so Tyler comes up and I flatten Tyler out here, this is the best position in all of Jiu Jitsu. This should be the ultimate goal. It's basically a shelf of the legs. Tyler cannot rotate his hips, he cannot find his toes on the ground and use them in any meaningful way, he cannot really bend his legs in a way that's going to help him. He's on his elbows here, obviously if we can flatten him out further it's going to be worse. Tyler has no ability to explode here. Tyler tries to move. So you can see here I can control Tyler without applying pressure, so if Tyler speaks here, he doesn't sound too bad, so again we can use this position in Jiu Jitsu without hurting or alienating our training partners or we can apply hip pressure. Tyler starts to talk here. So again, this should be the ultimate goal and sometimes foregoing a chair sit style back take to ultimately secure this position is going to be better for us. So again, if it's easy to see that that's the best position we could possibly be, it leaves him with the least amount of opportunities to defend, reverse or even be comfortable, then why would we elect to take a chair sit back take to place hooks and put our training partners, our opponents in positions that aren't too uncomfortable when we could ultimately work to this position. Part of me thinks that a lot of people think that it's up to the defender to take certain risks that lead us to flattening them out. My argument would be is that we can approach top position in such a way that backs them into a corner, forcing them into these positions. We can dictate placing them here. We don't just have to be reactive in this sense and again a lot of people might not choose to flatten out their training partners because trying to maintain healthy friendships. I think that this should be the top priority in all of top position. We pin our opponents, we control them in such a way that we maintain on top, we maintain safe, we pin their legs and we ultimately use some upper body tools that we'll cover next to force our training partners into these positions. And again, it can be as uncomfortable on them as you want it to be. If I was rolling with Ethan Kralenstein, I would literally try to break his spine from this position. But if I was rolling with other people, I would probably be pretty delicate in a position like this. But again, ask yourself this question. If we objectively know this is the best position in all of Jiu Jitsu, then why are we not seeking to place our opponents or our training partners in this position more? Why are we not trying to develop systems to put them here? And again, the answer is obvious. It's because we're choosing point scoring positions over control positions. And again, I think this is imperative that we see this position in more of Jiu Jitsu as a sport and more in the gym training these positions.
